      "\n",
      "A History of Western Society grew out of the authors’ \n",
      "desire to infuse new life into the study of Western Civilization. \n",
      "We knew that historians were using imaginative \n",
      "questions and innovative research to open up vast new \n",
      "areas of historical interest and knowledge. We also recognized \n",
      "that these advances had dramatically affected the \n",
      "subject of European economic, intellectual, and, especially, \n",
      "social history, while new research and fresh interpretations \n",
      "were also revitalizing the study of the traditional mainstream \n",
      "of political, diplomatic, and religious developments. \n",
      "Despite history’s vitality as a discipline, however, \n",
      "it seemed to us at the time that both the broad public \n",
      "and the intelligentsia were generally losing interest in the \n",
      "past. That, fortunately for us all, has not proven the case. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It was our conviction, based on considerable experience \n",
      "introducing large numbers of students to the broad \n",
      "sweep of Western Civilization, that a book in which social \n",
      "history was the core element could excite readers and inspire \n",
      "a renewed interest in history. Our strategy was thus \n",
      "twofold. First, we incorporated recent research by social \n",
      "historians as we sought to re-create the life of ordinary \n",
      "people in appealing human terms. At the same time, we \n",
      "were determined to give great economic, political, cultural, \n",
      "and intellectual developments the attention they unquestionably \n",
      "deserve. We wanted to give individual readers \n",
      "and teachers a balanced, integrated perspective so that they \n",
      "could pursue—on their own or in the classroom—those \n",
      "themes and questions that they found particularly exciting \n",
      "and significant. In an effort to realize fully the potential \n",
      "of our fresh yet balanced approach, we made many \n",
      "changes, large and small, in the editions that followed. \n",
      "\n",
      "Changes in the Ninth Edition \n",
      "\n",
      "In preparing the Ninth Edition we have worked hard to \n",
      "keep our book up-to-date by including as much valuable \n",
      "and relevant new scholarship as possible. We have also \n",
      "strengthened our distinctive yet balanced approach to a \n",
      "wide range of topics. In addition, we have revised the layout \n",
      "of the chapters somewhat to foreground the historical \n",
      "questions posed and answered in each chapter, and \n",
      "added a new map feature. This edition includes the best of \n",
      "\n",
      "previous editions, while blending in the most important \n",
      "recent findings. \n",
      "\n",
      "Conceptual and Content Revisions \n",
      "\n",
      "Several main lines of revision have guided our many \n",
      "changes. In particular, we have approached the history of \n",
      "the West as part of the history of the world and have devoted \n",
      "more space to Europe’s interactions with the rest \n",
      "of the world. This has meant that some parts of the book \n",
      "have been completely reconceptualized and reorganized, \n",
      "as have many of the sections within chapters. Chapter 15 is \n",
      "now entirely devoted to European exploration, discovery, \n",
      "and conquest and also includes coverage of world contacts \n",
      "before Columbus. Chapter 19 includes discussion of \n",
      "European trade with Asia, and Chapter 20 incorporates \n",
      "extended coverage of the impact of colonial products, including \n",
      "sugar, tea, coffee, and tobacco. Chapter 21 has \n",
      "considerable new material on the Haitian revolution; Chapter \n",
      "29 includes more on World War II outside of Europe; \n",
      "and Chapter 30 has more on decolonization in the Middle \n",
      "East and Africa. \n",
      "\n",
      "A second major change is updated discussion of gender \n",
      "throughout the text. The development of women’s \n",
      "and gender history has been a central part of the expansion \n",
      "of historical knowledge over the last several decades, \n",
      "and this edition includes even fuller discussion of the role \n",
      "of gender in shaping human experience than did previous \n",
      "editions. Some of this new material focuses on women, \n",
      "including women’s role in the court culture of early \n",
      "modern Europe (Chapter 16) and women’s work in the \n",
      "Industrial Revolution (Chapter 22). Other sections ask \n",
      "readers to consider the ways in which gender is related \n",
      "to other social hierarchies, such as social status and race \n",
      "(Chapters 13 and 30), or ways in which religious or \n",
      "intellectual concepts are gendered (Chapter 16). New \n",
      "scholarship on gender has meant revisions in other sections \n",
      "as well, including discussion of the Reformation, \n",
      "the witch-hunts, the scientific revolution, nineteenth-\n",
      "century cities, and cold war Europe. The discussion of \n",
      "gender is accompanied by updates to the material on \n",

      "\n",
      "These two major lines of revision are accompanied by \n",
      "continued enhancement of content that began in earlier \n",
      "editions. The social history focus that has been the core \n",
      "element of this book since its first edition continues. In \n",
      "addition to more material on Europe in a global perspective, \n",
      "we have continued to incorporate more discussion of \n",
      "groups and regions that are frequently shortchanged in \n",
      "the general histories of Europe and Western Civilization. \n",
      "This expanded scope reflects the renewed awareness within \n",
      "the profession of Europe’s enormous historical diversity, \n",
      "as well as the efforts of contemporary Europeans to understand \n",
      "the ambivalent and contested meanings of their \n",
      "national, regional, ethnic, and pan-European identities. \n",
      "Several chapters examine notions of race during times of \n",
      "significant cultural change, including the Renaissance \n",
      "(Chapter 13), the first wave of colonization (Chapter 15), \n",

      "\n",
      "An important part of this continued broader focus \n",
      "is material on Islam. Chapters 17, 25, and 27 all include \n",
      "significant new material on the Ottoman Empire. Several \n",
      "of the new features focus on Muslims living in Europe, as \n",
      "well as issues involving Christian-Muslim relations. \n",
      "\n",
      "We believe that including examples of problems of historical \n",
      "interpretations in our text helps our readers develop \n",
      "the critical-thinking skills that are among the most \n",
      "precious benefits of studying history. Examples of this \n",
      "more open-ended, interpretative approach include debates \n",
      "about the impact of Enlightenment thought (Chapter 18) \n",
      "and renewed debate on personal and collective responsibility \n",
      "for the Holocaust (Chapter 29). \n",
      "\n",
      "Concern with terminology is key to new ways in which \n",
      "history is being studied, researched, and presented, and \n",
      "among the historiographical issues we present are some \n",
      "that ask readers to consider the implications of words they \n",
      "(and historians) use regularly without thinking much about \n",
      "them. This includes discussion of the terms “Renaissance” \n",
      "and “modern” (Chapter 13) and disputes about \n",
      "who was and was not part of “the nation” (Chapter 25) or \n",
      "included in understandings of “Europe” (Chapter 31). \n",
      "\n",
      "This edition includes several major changes in the organization \n",
      "of chapters. Chapter 14 now includes material \n",
      "on the Reformations, religious wars, and witch-hunts, \n",
      "while, as noted above, Chapter 15 now focuses on exploration \n",
      "and overseas expansion. \n",
      "\n",
      "New Pedagogical Features \n",
      "\n",
      "To help focus and guide the reader, we pose specific historical \n",
      "questions keyed to the main chapter headings at \n",
      "the beginning of each chapter. These questions are then \n",
      "\n",
      "answered in the course of each chapter and repeated in \n",
      "an end-of-chapter summary that concisely reiterates the \n",
      "chapter’s findings. For this edition, many of the questions \n",
      "have been reframed, and the chapter summaries rewritten, \n",
      "to maximize the usefulness of this popular pedagogical \n",
      "device. Dates have been added to most chapter titles. \n",
      "\n",
      "This edition also adds a new feature, “Mapping the \n",
      "Past.” Historians have long relied on maps to help explain \n",
      "the stories that they tell, but we have found that \n",
      "students often do not pay as much attention to the maps \n",
      "as they should. Thus in the new “Mapping the Past” feature, \n",
      "one map in each chapter includes questions for discussion. \n",
      "Some of these questions refer only to a single \n",

      "lived. Each study or biographical sketch has been carefully \n",
      "integrated into the body of the text. The “Individuals \n",

      "the middle of the twelfth century Venice, supported \n",
      "by a huge merchant marine, had grown \n",
      "enormously rich through overseas trade. Genoa \n",
      "and Milan also enjoyed the benefits of a large \n",
      "volume of trade with the Middle East and northern \n",
      "Europe. These cities fully exploited their geographical \n",
      "positions as natural crossroads for \n",
      "mercantile exchange between the East and the \n",
      "West. Furthermore, in the early fourteenth century \n",
      "Genoa and Venice made important strides \n",
      "in shipbuilding that for the first time allowed \n",
      "their ships to sail all year long. Advances in ship \n",
      "construction greatly increased the volume of \n",
      "goods that could be transported; improvements \n",
      "in the mechanics of sailing accelerated speed. \n",
      "\n",
      "Scholars tend to agree that the first artistic \n",
      "and literary manifestations of the Italian Renaissance \n",
      "appeared in Florence, which possessed enormous \n",
      "wealth despite geographical constraints: it \n",
      "was an inland city without easy access to sea transportation. \n",
      "But toward the end of the thirteenth \n",

      "By the first quarter of the fourteenth century, the economic \n",

      "Milan, Florence, Genoa, Siena, and Pisa fought for and \n",
      "won their independence from surrounding feudal nobles. \n",
      "The nobles, attracted by the opportunities of long-\n",

      "large dowries of brides providing cash for their new husbands’ \n",

      "feudal nobility and the commercial elite created a powerful \n",
      "oligarchy, or small group that ruled a city and its surrounding \n",
      "countryside. The ruling oligarchy in any city \n",
      "was tied together by blood, economic interests, and social \n",
      "connections, but was also often divided by hostilities \n",
      "of kinship groups toward one another. Such hostilities \n",
      "sometimes erupted in violence, and Italian communes \n",
      "were often politically unstable. \n",
      "\n",
      "Conflict between families within the ruling oligarchy \n",

      "and social connections. Only a tiny percentage of the \n",

      "could hold office in the commune’s political councils. \n",
      "The common people, called the popolo, were disenfranchised \n",
      "and heavily taxed, and they bitterly resented \n",
      "their exclusion from power. The popolo wanted places \n",
      "in the communal government and equality of taxation. \n",

      "particularly scholars and writers known as humanists, \n",
      "that they were living in a new era. Key to this \n",
      "attitude was a serious interest in the Latin classics, a belief \n",

      "train them for an active life of public service, but they had \n",
      "doubts about whether humanist education was appropriate \n",

      "religious concerns became more pronounced, and Christian \n",
      "humanists set out plans for the reform of church and \n",
      "society. Their ideas were spread to a much wider audience \n",

      "of the printing press with movable metal type, \n",
      "which revolutionized communication. \n",

      "Interest in the classical past and in the individual also \n",

      "Painting became more naturalistic, and the individual \n",
      "portrait emerged as a distinct artistic genre. Wealthy merchants, \n",
      "cultured rulers, and powerful popes all hired \n",
      "painters, sculptors, and architects to design and ornament \n",

      "more apt to retain the divine stories when taught by \n",

      "The use of inquisitorial procedure did not always lead \n",
      "to witch-hunts, however. The most famous inquisitions \n",
      "in early modern Europe, those in Spain, Portugal, and \n",
      "Italy, were in fact very lenient in their treatment of people \n",
      "accused of witchcraft: the Inquisition in Spain executed \n",
      "only a handful of witches, the Portuguese Inquisition \n",
      "only one, and the Roman Inquisition none, though in \n",
      "each of these areas there were hundreds of cases. Inquisitors \n",
      "certainly believed in the power of the Devil and were \n",
      "no less misogynist than other judges, but they doubted \n",
      "very much whether the people accused of witchcraft had \n",
      "actually made pacts with the Devil that gave them special \n",
      "powers. They viewed such people not as diabolical Devil-\n",

      "raise a hailstorm, or do other types of harm. Tensions \n",

      "those accused of witchcraft were often older was \n",
      "that it took years to build up a reputation as a witch. At \n",
      "this point, the suspect was brought in for questioning by \n",
      "legal authorities. Judges and inquisitors sought the exact \n",
      "details of a witch’s demonic contacts, including sexual \n",

      "The Catholic Church in the early sixteenth century had \n",
      "serious problems, and many individuals and groups had \n",
      "long called for reform. This background of discontent \n",
      "helps explain why Martin Luther’s ideas found such a \n",

      "a new understanding of Christian doctrine that emphasized \n",
      "faith, the power of God’s grace, and the centrality \n",
      "of the Bible. Protestant ideas were attractive to educated \n",
      "people and urban residents, and they spread rapidly \n",
      "through preaching, hymns, and the printing press. By \n",
      "1530 many parts of the Holy Roman Empire and Scandinavia \n",
      "had broken with the Catholic Church. Some \n",
      "reformers developed more radical ideas about infant \n",
      "baptism, the ownership of property, and separation between \n",
      "church and state. Both Protestants and Catholics \n",
      "regarded these as dangerous, and radicals were banished \n",
      "or executed. The German Peasants’ War, in which Luther’s \n",
      "ideas were linked to calls for social and economic reform, \n",
      "was similarly put down harshly. The Protestant reformers \n",
      "did not break with medieval ideas about the proper gender \n",
      "hierarchy, though they did elevate the status of marriage \n",
      "and viewed orderly households as the key building \n",
      "blocks of society. \n",
      "\n",
      "The progress of the Reformation was shaped by the \n",

      "to develop their own theology and plans for institutional \n",

      "Martin Luther, On Christian Liberty \n",
      "\n",
      "The idea of liberty or freedom has played a \n",
      "powerful role in the history of Western society and \n",
      "culture, but the meaning and understanding of liberty \n",
      "has undergone continual change and interpretation. \n",
      "In the Roman world, where slavery was a basic \n",
      "institution, liberty meant the condition of being a free \n",
      "man, independent of obligations to a master. In the \n",
      "Middle Ages possessing liberty meant having special \n",
      "privileges or rights that other persons or institutions \n",
      "did not have. A lord or a monastery, for example, \n",
      "might speak of his or its liberties, and citizens in \n",
      "London were said to possess the “freedom of the city,” \n",
      "which allowed them to practice trades and \n",
      "own property without interference. Likewise, the first \n",
      "chapter of Magna Carta (1215), often called the \n",
      "“Charter of Liberties,” states: “Holy Church shall \n",
      "be free and have its rights entire and its liberties \n",
      "inviolate,” meaning that the English church was \n",
      "independent of the authority of the king. \n",
      "\n",
      "The idea of liberty also has a religious dimension, \n",
      "and the reformer Martin Luther formulated a classic \n",
      "interpretation of liberty in his treatise On Christian \n",
      "Liberty (sometimes translated On the Freedom of a \n",
      "Christian), arguably his finest piece. Written in Latin \n",
      "for the pope but translated immediately into German \n",
      "and published widely, it contains the main themes \n",
      "of Luther’s theology: the importance of faith, the \n",
      "relationship of Christian faith and good works, the \n",
      "dual nature of human beings, and the fundamental \n",
      "importance of Scripture. Luther writes that \n",
      "Christians were freed from sin and death through \n",
      "Christ, not through their own actions. \n",
      "\n",
      "Christian faith has appeared to many an easy thing; \n",
      "nay, not a few even reckon it among the social \n",
      "virtues, as it were; and this they do because they \n",
      "have not made proof of it experimentally, and have \n",
      "never tasted of what efficacy it is. For it is not \n",
      "possible for any man to write well about it, or to \n",
      "understand well what is rightly written, who has \n",
      "not at some time tasted of its spirit, under the \n",
      "pressure of tribulation; while he who has tasted \n",
      "\n",
      "of it, even to a very small extent, can never write, \n",
      "speak, think, or hear about it sufficiently.... \n",
      "\n",
      "I hope that ...I have attained some little \n",
      "drop of faith, and that I can speak of this matter, if \n",
      "not with more elegance, certainly with more \n",
      "solidity.... \n",
      "\n",
      "A Christian man is the most free lord of all, \n",
      "and subject to none; a Christian man is the most \n",
      "dutiful servant of all, and subject to everyone. \n",
      "\n",
      "Although these statements appear contradictory, \n",
      "yet, when they are found to agree together, they \n",
      "will do excellently for my purpose. They are both \n",
      "the statements of Paul himself, who says, “Though \n",
      "I be free from all men, yet have I made myself a \n",
      "servant unto all” (I Cor. 9:19), and “Owe no man \n",
      "anything but to love one another” (Rom. 13:8). \n",
      "Now love is by its own nature dutiful and obedient \n",
      "to the beloved object. Thus even Christ, though \n",

      "nutmeg, ginger, mace, cinnamon, and cloves added flavor \n",
      "and variety to the monotonous diet of Europeans. \n",
      "Spices evoked the scent of the Garden of Eden; they \n",

      "that the term spices referred not only to flavorings \n",
      "added to food but also to perfumes, medicines, \n",
      "drugs, and dyes. Take, for example, cloves, for which Europeans \n",
      "found many uses. If picked green and sugared, \n",
      "the buds could be transformed into conserve (a kind of \n",
      "jam); if salted and pickled, cloves became a flavoring for \n",
      "vinegar. Cloves sweetened the breath. When added to \n",
      "food or drink, cloves were thought to stimulate the appetite \n",
      "and clear the intestines and bladder. When crushed \n",
      "and powdered, they were a medicine rubbed on the forehead \n",
      "to relieve head colds and applied to the eyes to \n",
      "strengthen vision. Taken with milk, cloves were believed \n",
      "to enhance the pleasures of sexual intercourse. \n",
      "\n",
      "Apart from a desire for trade goods, religious fervor \n",

      "sacramental purposes—were not grown in America. So \n",
      "the migrants sought to turn the New World into the Old: \n",
      "they searched for climatic zones favorable to those crops. \n",
      "Everywhere they settled they raised wheat—in the highlands \n",
      "of Mexico, the Rio de la Plata, New Granada (in \n",
      "northern South America), and Chile. By 1535 Mexico \n",
      "was exporting wheat. Grapes did well in parts of Peru \n",

      "where suitable soil and adequate rainfall would nourish \n",

      "and the Portuguese carried these items to Brazil. \n",

      "sheep, dogs, pigs, chickens, and goats. The multiplication \n",
      "of these animals proved spectacular. By the 1550s, \n",
      "when the Spaniards explored, they brought along herds \n",

      "about as they pleased. Opportunities and improvements \n",
      "in the East had a positive impact on the West, where the \n",
      "weight of serfdom was also reduced between 1100 and \n",

      "police power against the peasantry in two ways. First, \n",
      "they restricted or eliminated the peasants’ time-honored \n",
      "right of freedom of movement. Thus a peasant could no \n",

      "independent farmers paying freely negotiated rents, peasants \n",
      "became forced laborers on the lords’ estates. By the \n",

      "the winter of 1656–1657, killing and carrying off thousands \n",

      "government through the estates, but they refused to join \n",
      "representatives of the towns in a common front. Instead, \n",

      "new star of 1572. Aided by generous grants from the \n",
      "king of Denmark, Brahe built the most sophisticated observatory \n",

      "prevented him, however, from making much \n",
      "sense out of his data. Part Ptolemaic, part Copernican, he \n",
      "\n",
      "believed that all the planets revolved around the sun and \n",
      "that the entire group of sun and planets revolved in turn \n",
      "around the earth-moon system. \n",
      "\n",
      "It was left to Brahe’s brilliant young assistant, Johannes \n",
      "Kepler (1571–1630), to go much further. Kepler \n",
      "was a medieval figure in many ways. Coming from a minor \n",
      "German noble family and trained for the Lutheran \n",
      "ministry, he long believed that the universe was built on \n",

      "went beyond mystical intuitions. \n",
      "\n",
      "Kepler formulated three famous laws of planetary motion. \n",
      "First, building on Copernican theory, he demonstrated \n",
      "in 1609 that the orbits of the planets around the \n",
      "sun are elliptical rather than circular. Second, he demonstrated \n",
      "that the planets do not move at a uniform speed \n",
      "in their orbits. Third, in 1619 he showed that the time a \n",
      "planet takes to make its complete orbit is precisely related \n",
      "to its distance from the sun. Kepler’s contribution was \n",
      "monumental. Whereas Copernicus had speculated, Kepler \n",
      "proved mathematically the precise relations of a sun-\n",

      "Florentine named Galileo Galilei (1564–1642) was challenging \n",
      "all the old ideas about motion. Like so many early \n",
      "scientists, Galileo was a poor nobleman first marked for \n",
      "a religious career. However, he soon became fascinated \n",
      "by mathematics. A brilliant student, in 1589 Galileo became \n",
      "a professor of mathematics at age twenty-five. He \n",
      "proceeded to examine motion and mechanics in a new \n",

      "rather than speculate about what might or should happen, \n",
      "Galileo conducted controlled experiments to find \n",
      "out what actually did happen. In his famous acceleration \n",
      "experiment, he showed that a uniform force—in this \n",
      "case, gravity—produced a uniform acceleration. Here is \n",
      "how Galileo described his pathbreaking method and conclusion \n",
      "in his Two New Sciences: \n",
      "\n",
      "A piece of wooden moulding...was taken; on its edge was \n",

      "made this groove very straight, smooth and polished, \n",
      "and having lined it with parchment, also as smooth and polished \n",
      "as possible, we rolled along it a hard, smooth and very \n",

      "such experiments [over many distances], repeated a full \n",
      "hundred times, we always found that the spaces traversed \n",
      "were to each other as the squares of the times, and that this \n",
      "was true for all inclinations of the plane.4 \n",
      "\n",
      "With this and other experiments, Galileo formulated the \n",

      "\n",
      "At the end of the seventeenth century the economy of \n",
      "Europe was agrarian. With the possible exception of Holland, \n",
      "at least 80 percent of the people of all western \n",
      "European countries drew their livelihoods from agriculture. \n",
      "In eastern Europe the percentage was considerably \n",
      "higher. Men and women lavished their attention on the \n",
      "land, plowing fields and sowing seed, reaping harvests \n",
      "and storing grain. Yet even in a rich agricultural region \n",
      "such as the Po Valley in northern Italy, every bushel of \n",
      "wheat sown yielded on average only five or six bushels of \n",
      "grain at harvest during the seventeenth century. By modern \n",
      "standards output was distressingly low. \n",
      "\n",
      "In most regions of Europe in the sixteenth and seventeenth \n",
      "centuries, climatic conditions produced poor or \n",
      "disastrous harvests every eight or nine years. Unbalanced \n",
      "and inadequate food in famine years made people extremely \n",
      "susceptible to illness. Eating material unfit for \n",
      "human consumption, such as bark or grass, resulted in \n",
      "intestinal ailments of many kinds. Influenza and smallpox \n",
      "preyed on populations weakened by famine. In famine \n",
      "years the number of deaths soared far above normal. A \n",
      "third of a village’s population might disappear in a year or \n",
      "two. But new developments in agricultural technology \n",
      "and methods gradually brought an end to the ravages of \n",
      "hunger in western Europe. \n",
      "\n",
      "• What were the causes and effects of the agricultural \n",
      "revolution, and what nations led the way in these \n",
      "developments? \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Open-Field System \n",
      "\n",
      "These new developments drew on long roots. The great \n",
      "accomplishment of medieval agriculture was the open-\n",
      "field system of village farming. That system divided the \n",
      "land to be cultivated by the peasants of a given village \n",
      "into several large fields, which were in turn cut up into \n",
      "long, narrow strips. The fields were open, and the strips \n",
      "were not enclosed into small plots by fences or hedges. \n",
      "Each family followed the same pattern of plowing, sowing, \n",
      "and harvesting in accordance with tradition and the \n",
      "village leaders. \n",
      "\n",
      "The ever-present problem was soil exhaustion. Wheat \n",
      "planted year after year in a field will deplete the nitrogen \n",
      "in the soil. Since the supply of manure for fertilizer was \n",
      "limited, the only way for the land to recover was to lie fallow \n",
      "for a period of time. In the early Middle Ages a year \n",
      "of fallow was alternated with a year of cropping; then \n",
      "\n",
      "three-year rotations were introduced, especially on more \n",
      "fertile lands. This system permitted a year of wheat or rye \n",
      "to be followed by a year of oats or beans and only then by \n",
      "a year of fallow. Significant gains in agricultural production \n",
      "resulted. \n",
      "\n",
      "Traditional village rights reinforced communal patterns \n",
      "of farming. In addition to rotating field crops in a \n",
      "uniform way, villages maintained open meadows for hay \n",
      "and natural pasture. These lands were common lands, set \n",
      "aside primarily for draft horses and oxen, but open to the \n",
      "cows and pigs of the community as well. After the harvest \n",
      "villagers also pastured their animals on the wheat or rye \n",
      "stubble. In many places such pasturing followed a brief \n",
      "period, also established by tradition, for the gleaning of \n",
      "grain. Poor women would go through the fields picking \n",
      "up the few single grains that had fallen to the ground in \n",
      "the course of the harvest. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the age of absolutism and nobility, the state and \n",
      "landlords continued to levy heavy taxes and high rents, \n",
      "thereby stripping peasants of much of their meager earnings. \n",
      "The level of exploitation varied. Generally speaking, \n",
      "the peasants of eastern Europe were worst off. As we saw \n",
      "in Chapter 17, they were serfs bound to their lords in \n",
      "hereditary service. In much of eastern Europe, five or six \n",
      "days of unpaid work per week on the lord’s land were not \n",
      "uncommon. Well into the nineteenth century individual \n",
      "Russian serfs and serf families were regularly sold with \n",
      "and without land. \n",
      "\n",
      "Social conditions were better in western Europe, where \n",
      "peasants were generally free from serfdom. In France, \n",
      "western Germany, England, and the Low Countries, they \n",
      "owned land and could pass it on to their children. Yet \n",
      "life in the village was unquestionably hard, and poverty \n",
      "was the great reality for most people. The privileges of \n",
      "Europe’s ruling elites weighed heavily on the people of \n",
      "the land. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Agricultural Revolution \n",
      "\n",
      "One way for European peasants to improve their difficult \n",
      "position was to take land from those who owned it \n",
      "but did no labor. Yet the social and political conditions \n",
      "that sustained the ruling elites were ancient and deeply \n",
      "rooted, and powerful forces stood ready to crush protest. \n",
      "Only with the coming of the French Revolution \n",
      "were European peasants, mainly in France, able to improve \n",
      "their position by means of radical mass action. \n",
      "\n",
      "Technological progress offered another possibility. If \n",
      "peasants (and their noble landlords) could replace the idle \n",
      "fallow with crops, they could greatly increase the land \n",
      "under cultivation. So remarkable were the possibilities \n",
      "\n",
      "\f\n",
      "and the results that historians have often spoken of the \n",

      "producers before they sold to the merchant. Sometimes \n",
      "whole families were involved in domestic industry; \n",

      "Until the nineteenth century, the industry that employed \n",
      "the most people in Europe was textiles. The making of \n",
      "linen, woolen, and eventually cotton cloth was the typical \n",
      "activity of cottage workers engaged in the putting-out \n",
      "system. A look inside the cottage of the English weaver \n",
      "illustrates a way of life as well as an economic system. \n",
      "\n",
      "The rural worker lived in a small cottage with tiny windows \n",
      "and little space. Indeed, the worker’s cottage was \n",
      "often a single room that served as workshop, kitchen, \n",
      "and bedroom. There were only a few pieces of furniture, \n",
      "of which the weaver’s loom was by far the largest and \n",
      "most important. That loom had changed somewhat in \n",
      "the early eighteenth century when John Kay’s invention \n",
      "of the flying shuttle enabled the weaver to throw the \n",
      "shuttle back and forth between the threads with one \n",
      "hand. Aside from that improvement, however, the loom \n",
      "was as it had been for much of history and as it would remain \n",
      "until the arrival of mechanized looms in the first \n",
      "decades of the nineteenth century. \n",
      "\n",
      "Handloom weaving was a family enterprise. All members \n",
      "of the family helped in the work, so that “every person \n",
      "from seven to eighty (who retained their sight and \n",
      "who could move their hands) could earn their bread,” \n",
      "as one eighteenth-century English observer put it.2 Operating \n",
      "the loom was considered a man’s job, reserved \n",
      "for the male head of the family. Women and children \n",
      "worked at auxiliary tasks; they prepared the warp (vertical) \n",
      "threads and mounted them on the loom, wound \n",
      "threads on bobbins for the weft (horizontal) threads, and \n",
      "sometimes operated the warp frame while the father \n",
      "passed the shuttle. \n",
      "\n",
      "There was always a serious imbalance in textile manufacture \n",
      "before mechanization: the work of four or five \n",
      "spinners was needed to keep one weaver steadily employed. \n",
      "Since the weaver’s family usually could not produce \n",
      "enough thread, alternate sources of labor were \n",
      "needed. Merchants turned to the wives and daughters \n",
      "of agricultural workers, who took on spinning work in \n",
      "their spare time. Many widows and single women also \n",
      "became “spinsters,” so many in fact that the word became \n",
      "a synonym for an unmarried woman. (In other \n",
      "parts of Europe, such as the Rhineland, spinning employed \n",
      "whole families and was not reserved for women.) \n",
      "As the industry expanded and merchants covered ever \n",
      "greater distances in search of workers, they sometimes \n",
      "turned to local shopkeepers to manage the spinners in \n",
      "their villages. \n",

      "Conditions were particularly hard for female workers. \n",
      "While men could earn decent wages through long hours of \n",
      "arduous labor, women’s wages were always terribly low. In \n",
      "the Yorkshire wool industry, a male wool comber earned a \n",
      "good wage of twelve shillings or more a week, while a spinner \n",
      "could hope for only three-and-a-half shillings.4 A single \n",

      "There was another problem, at least from the merchant \n",
      "capitalist’s point of view. Rural labor was cheap, \n",
      "scattered, and poorly organized. For these reasons it was \n",
      "hard to control. Moreover, the pace of work depended \n",
      "on the agricultural calendar. In spring and late summer \n",
      "planting and haymaking occupied all hands in the rural \n",

      "whose livelihood depended on their ability to \n",
      "meet orders on time, bitterly resented their lack of control \n",
      "over rural labor. They accused workers—especially \n",
      "female spinners—of laziness, intemperance, and immorality. \n",
      "If workers failed to produce enough thread, \n",
      "they reasoned, it must be because their wages were too \n",
      "high and they had little incentive to work. Merchants \n",
      "thus insisted on maintaining the lowest possible wages to \n",
      "force the “idle” poor into productive labor. They also \n",

      "they were eaten fresh in late spring and summer. Dried, \n",

      "many needs. The parish church was the focal point of \n",

      "gations gossiped and swapped stories after services, and \n",

      "was woven into the very fabric of community life. \n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, the local church had important administrative \n",

      "regulatory framework of belief, which went back at least \n",
      "to the fourth century when Christianity became the official \n",
      "religion of the Roman Empire, had undergone important \n",
      "changes since 1500. The Protestant Reformation \n",
      "had burst forth as a culmination of medieval religiosity \n",
      "and a desire to purify Christian belief. Martin Luther, the \n",
      "most influential of the early reformers, preached that all \n",
      "men and women were saved from their sins and God’s \n",
      "damnation only by personal faith in Jesus Christ. The \n",
      "individual could reach God directly, without need of \n",

      "As the Reformation gathered force, with peasant upheaval \n",
      "and doctrinal competition, German princes and \n",
      "monarchs in northern Europe put themselves at the head \n",
      "of official churches in their territories. Protestant authorities, \n",
      "with generous assistance from state-certified theologians \n",
      "like Luther, then proceeded to regulate their \n",
      "“territorial churches” strictly, selecting personnel and \n",
      "imposing detailed rules. They joined with Catholics to \n",

      "had no Scriptural basis. Such revolutionary changes often \n",
      "troubled ordinary churchgoers, but by the late seventeenth \n",
      "century the vast reforms of the Reformation were \n",
      "complete and routinized in most Protestant churches. \n",

      "The Protestant revival began in Germany. It was known \n",
      "as Pietism, and three aspects helped explain its powerful \n",
      "appeal. First, Pietism called for a warm, emotional religion \n",
      "that everyone could experience. Enthusiasm—in \n",
      "prayer, in worship, in preaching, in life itself—was the key \n",
      "concept. “Just as a drunkard becomes full of wine, so \n",

      "heart must burn.”17 \n",
      "\n",
      "Second, Pietism reasserted the earlier radical stress on \n",
      "the priesthood of all believers, thereby reducing the gulf \n",
      "between official clergy and Lutheran laity. Bible reading \n",
      "and study were enthusiastically extended to all classes, \n",
      "and this provided a powerful spur for popular education \n",
      "as well as individual religious development (see page \n",
      "662). Finally, Pietists believed in the practical power of \n",

      "One such man was William Cockerill, a Lancashire carpenter. \n",
      "He and his sons began building cotton-spinning \n",
      "equipment in French-occupied Belgium in 1799. In \n",
      "1817 the most famous son, John Cockerill, purchased \n",
      "the old summer palace of the deposed bishops of Liège in \n",

      "Cockerill’s plants in the Liège area became an industrial \n",

      "and transmitting it across Europe. Many skilled British \n",
      "workers came illegally to work for Cockerill, and some \n",
      "went on to found their own companies throughout Europe. \n",
      "Newcomers brought the latest plans and secrets, so \n",
      "Cockerill could boast that ten days after an industrial advance \n",
      "occurred in Britain, he knew all about it in Belgium. \n",
      "Thus British technicians and skilled workers were a \n",
      "powerful force in the spread of early industrialization. \n",
      "\n",
      "A second agent of industrialization were talented entrepreneurs \n",

      "Harkort’s basic idea was simple, but it was enormously \n",
      "difficult to carry out. Lacking skilled laborers to do the \n",

      "Food prices rose faster than wages, and the living conditions \n",
      "of the laboring poor declined. Only after 1820, and \n",
      "especially after 1840, did real wages rise substantially, so \n",
      "that the average worker earned and consumed roughly \n",
      "50 percent more in real terms in 1850 than in 1770.7 In \n",
      "short, there was considerable economic improvement for \n",
      "workers throughout Great Britain by 1850, but that improvement \n",
      "was hard won and slow in coming. \n",
      "\n",
      "This important conclusion must be qualified, however. \n",
      "First, the hours in the average workweek increased, as some \n",
      "economic historians now believe it had been increasing in \n",
      "parts of northern Europe since the seventeenth century. \n",
      "Thus, to a large extent, workers earned more simply because \n",
      "they worked more. Indeed, significant recent research \n",
      "shows that in England nonagricultural workers \n",
      "labored about 250 days per year in 1760 as opposed \n",
      "to 300 days per year in 1830, while the normal workday \n",
      "remained an exhausting eleven hours throughout the \n",
      "entire period. In 1760 nonagricultural workers still observed \n",
      "many religious and public holidays by not working, \n",
      "and Monday was popularly known as “Saint Monday” \n",
      "because so many workers took the day off. These days \n",
      "of leisure and relaxation declined rapidly after 1760, \n",
      "and by 1830 nonagricultural workers had joined landless \n",
      "agricultural laborers in toiling six rather than five days \n",
      "a week.8 \n",
      "\n",
      "Second, the wartime decline in the average worker’s \n",
      "standard of living was very important. The difficult war \n",
      "years were formative years for the new factory labor \n",
      "force, and they colored the early experience of modern \n",
      "industrial life in somber tones. \n",
      "\n",
      "Another way to consider the workers’ standard of living \n",
      "is to look at the goods that they purchased. Again the \n",
      "evidence is somewhat contradictory. Speaking generally, \n",
      "workers ate somewhat more food of higher nutritional \n",
      "quality as the Industrial Revolution progressed, except \n",
      "during wartime. Diets became more varied; people ate \n",
      "more potatoes, dairy products, fruits, and vegetables. \n",
      "Clothing improved, but housing for working people \n",
      "probably deteriorated somewhat. In short, per capita use \n",
      "of specific goods supports the position that the standard \n",

      "\n",
      "The first factories were cotton mills, which began functioning \n",
      "along rivers and streams in the 1770s. Cottage \n",
      "workers, accustomed to the putting-out system, were reluctant \n",
      "to work in the new factories even when they received \n",
      "relatively good wages because factory work was \n",
      "unappealing. In the factory, workers had to keep up with \n",
      "the machine and follow its tempo. They had to show up \n",
      "every day and work long, monotonous hours. Factory \n",
      "workers had to adjust their daily lives to the shrill call of \n",
      "the factory whistle. \n",
      "\n",
      "Cottage workers were not used to that kind of life and \n",
      "discipline. All members of the family worked hard and \n",
      "long, but in spurts, setting their own pace. They could \n",
      "interrupt their work when they wanted to. Women and \n",
      "children could break up their long hours of spinning with \n",
      "other tasks. On Saturday afternoon the head of the family \n",
      "delivered the week’s work to the merchant manufacturer \n",
      "and got paid. Saturday night was a time of \n",
      "relaxation and drinking, especially for the men. Recovering \n",
      "from his hangover on Tuesday, the weaver bent to his \n",

      "sex. Family employment carried over into early factories \n",
      "and subcontracting, but it collapsed as child labor was restricted \n",
      "and new attitudes emerged. A different sexual division \n",
      "of labor gradually arose to take its place. The man \n",
      "emerged as the family’s primary wage earner, while the \n",
      "woman found only limited job opportunities. Generally \n",
      "denied good jobs at good wages in the growing urban \n",

      "housework, child care, and craftwork at home. \n",

      "This new pattern of “separate spheres” had several aspects. \n",

      "wages outside the house after the first child arrived, although \n",
      "they often earned small amounts doing putting-\n",

      "when married women did work for wages outside the \n",
      "house, they usually came from the poorest families, where \n",
      "the husbands were poorly paid, sick, unemployed, or \n",
      "missing. Third, these poor married (or widowed) women \n",
      "were joined by legions of young unmarried women, who \n",
      "worked full-time but only in certain jobs. Fourth, all \n",

      "Evolving gradually, but largely in place by 1850, \n",
      "the new sexual division of labor in Britain constituted a \n",
      "major development in the history of women and of the \n",
      "family. \n",
      "\n",
      "If the reorganization of paid work along gender lines is \n",
      "widely recognized, there is no agreement on its causes. \n",

      "the role of male-dominated craft unions in denying \n",

      "\n",
      "Three ideas stand out in this more recent interpretation. \n",
      "First, the new and unfamiliar discipline of the clock \n",
      "and the machine was especially hard on married women \n",
      "of the laboring classes. Above all, relentless factory discipline \n",
      "conflicted with child care in a way that labor on the \n",
      "farm or in the cottage had not. A woman operating earsplitting \n",
      "spinning machinery could mind a child of seven \n",
      "or eight working beside her (until such work was outlawed), \n",
      "but she could no longer pace herself through \n",
      "pregnancy or breast-feed her baby on the job. Thus a \n",
      "working-class woman had strong incentives to concentrate \n",
      "on child care within her home if her family could afford \n",
      "it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Second, running a household in conditions of primitive \n",
      "urban poverty was an extremely demanding job in its \n",
      "own right. There were no supermarkets or public transportation. \n",
      "Everything had to be done on foot. Shopping \n",
      "and feeding the family constituted a never-ending challenge. \n",
      "The woman marched from one tiny shop to another, \n",
      "dragging her tired children (for who was to watch \n",
      "them?) and struggling valiantly with heavy sacks and \n",
      "tricky shopkeepers. Yet another brutal job outside the \n",
      "house—a “second shift”—had limited appeal for the average \n",
      "married woman. Thus women might well have accepted \n",
      "the emerging division of labor as the best available \n",
      "strategy for family survival in the industrializing society.10 \n",
      "\n",
      "Third, why were the women who did work for wages \n",

      "“women’s jobs”? No doubt the desire of males to monopolize \n",
      "the best opportunities and hold women down \n",
      "provides part of the answer. Yet as some feminist scholars \n",

      "The growth of industry posed enormous challenges for all elements of \n",

      "saw in Chapter 22, the early consequences of economic transformation \n",
      "were mixed and far-reaching and by no means wholly negative. By 1850 \n",
      "at the latest, working conditions were improving and real wages were rising \n",

      "Industry and the Growth of Cities \n",
      "Since the Middle Ages, European cities had been centers \n",
      "of government, culture, and large-scale commerce. They \n",
      "had also been congested, dirty, and unhealthy. People \n",
      "were packed together almost as tightly as possible within \n",
      "the city limits. The typical city was a “walking city”: for \n",
      "all but the wealthiest classes, walking was the only available \n",
      "form of transportation. \n",
      "Infectious disease spread with deadly speed in cities, \n",
      "and people were always more likely to die in the city than \n",
      "in the countryside. In the larger towns, more people died \n",
      "each year than were born, on average, and urban populations \n",
      "were able to maintain their numbers only because \n",
      "newcomers were continually arriving from rural areas. \n",
      "Little could be done to improve these conditions, given \n",
      "the pervasive poverty, absence of urban transportation, \n",
      "lack of medical knowledge, and deadly overcrowding. \n",
      "Clearly, deplorable urban conditions did not originate \n",
      "with the Industrial Revolution. What the Industrial Revolution \n",
      "did was to reveal those conditions more nakedly \n",
      "than ever before. The steam engine freed industrialists \n",
      "from dependence on the energy of fast-flowing streams \n",
      "and rivers so that by 1800 there was every incentive to \n",
      "build new factories in urban areas. Cities had better shipping \n",
      "facilities than the countryside and thus better supplies \n",
      "of coal and raw materials. There were also many \n",
      "hands wanting work in the cities, for cities drew people \n",
      "like a magnet. And it was a great advantage for a manufacturer \n",
      "to have other factories nearby to supply the business’s \n",
      "needs and buy its products. Therefore, as industry \n",
      "grew, there was also a rapid expansion of already overcrowded \n",
      "and unhealthy cities. \n",
      "The challenge of the urban environment was felt first \n",
      "and most acutely in Great Britain. The number of people \n",
      "living in cities of 20,000 or more in England and Wales \n",
      "jumped from 1.5 million in 1801 to 6.3 million in 1851 \n",

      "of its substantial earnings on meat and fully 25 percent of \n",
      "its income on food and drink. Spending on food was also \n",
      "great because the dinner party was this class’s favored social \n",

      "family had crossed the cultural divide separating the \n",

      "During the eight years of our higher schooling \n",
      "[beyond grade school], something had occurred \n",
      "which was of great importance to each one of us: \n",
      "we ten-year-olds had grown into virile young men \n",
      "of sixteen, seventeen, and eighteen, and Nature \n",
      "began to assert its rights....It did not take us \n",
      "long to discover that those authorities in whom \n",
      "we had previously confided—school, family, \n",
      "and public morals—manifested an astonishing \n",
      "insincerity in this matter of sex. But what is more, \n",
      "they also demanded secrecy and reserve from us in \n",
      "this connection.... \n",
      "\n",
      "This “social morality,” which on the one hand \n",
      "privately presupposed the existence of sexuality \n",
      "and its natural course, but on the other would \n",
      "not recognize it openly at any price, was doubly \n",
      "deceitful. While it winked one eye at a young man \n",
      "and even encouraged him with the other “to sow \n",
      "his wild oats,” as the kindly language of the home \n",
      "put it, in the case of a woman it studiously shut \n",
      "both eyes and acted as if it were blind. That a man \n",
      "could experience desires, and was permitted to \n",
      "\n",
      "experience them, was silently admitted by custom. \n",
      "But to admit frankly that a woman could be \n",
      "subject to similar desires, or that creation for its \n",
      "eternal purposes also required a female polarity, \n",
      "would have transgressed the conception of the \n",
      "“sanctity of womanhood.” In the pre-Freudian \n",
      "era, therefore, the axiom was agreed upon that a \n",
      "female person could have no physical desires as \n",
      "long as they had not been awakened by man, and \n",
      "that, obviously, was officially permitted only in \n",
      "marriage. But even in those moral times, in Vienna \n",
      "in particular, the air was full of dangerous erotic \n",
      "infection, and a girl of good family had to live in a \n",
      "completely sterilized atmosphere, from the day of \n",
      "her birth until the day when she left the altar on \n",
      "her husband’s arm. In order to protect young \n",
      "girls, they were not left alone for a single \n",

      "inspected, and above all else, young girls were \n",
      "constantly kept busy to divert their attention from \n",
      "any possible dangerous thoughts. They had to \n",
      "practise the piano, learn singing and drawing, \n",
      "foreign languages, and the history of literature and \n",
      "art. They were educated and overeducated. But \n",
      "while the aim was to make them as educated and \n",
      "as socially correct as possible, at the same time \n",
      "society anxiously took great pains that they should \n",
      "remain innocent of all natural things to a degree \n",
      "unthinkable today. A young girl of good family \n",
      "was not allowed to have any idea of how the male \n",

      "into the world, for the angel was to enter into \n",
      "matrimony not only physically untouched, but \n",
      "completely “pure” spiritually as well. “Good \n",

      "meet a prostitute on the streets of a big city as it is \n",
      "to meet a wagon in the road, then the sidewalks \n",
      "were so sprinkled with women for sale that it was \n",
      "more difficult to avoid than to find them. To this \n",

      "almost 90 percent of the population lived off the land. \n",
      "Agricultural techniques were backward, and serfdom was \n",

      "hereditary basis, the peasant serf was little more than a \n",

      "the serfs in 1861. Human bondage was abolished forever, \n",
      "and the emancipated peasants received, on average, about \n",
      "half of the land. Yet they had to pay fairly high prices for \n",

      "each peasant village was jointly responsible for the payments \n",

      "\n",
      "Economic motives played an important role in the extension \n",
      "of political empires, especially the British Empire. \n",
      "By the late 1870s, France, Germany, and the United \n",
      "States were industrializing rapidly behind rising tariff \n",
      "barriers. Great Britain was losing its early lead and facing \n",

      "had exploited most profitably for more than a century. \n",
      "When continental powers began to grab territory in the \n",
      "1880s, the British followed suit immediately. They feared \n",
      "that France and Germany would seal off their empires \n",
      "with high tariffs and restrictions and that future economic \n",
      "opportunities would be lost forever. \n",
      "\n",
      "Actually, the overall economic gains of the new imperialism \n",
      "proved quite limited before 1914. The new \n",
      "colonies were simply too poor to buy much, and they offered \n",
      "few immediately profitable investments. Nonetheless, \n",
      "even the poorest, most barren desert was jealously \n",
      "prized, and no territory was ever abandoned. Colonies \n",
      "became important for political and diplomatic reasons. \n",
      "Each leading country saw colonies as crucial to national \n",

      "which were seen as racially distinct parts of the dominant \n",
      "white race, had to seize colonies to show they were strong \n",
      "and virile. Moreover, since racial struggle was nature’s inescapable \n",
      "law, the conquest of “inferior” peoples was just. \n",
      "“The path of progress is strewn with the wreck . . . of inferior \n",

      "wished to escape full-blown Western political rule. Thus it \n",

      "or “modernizers” at the other, and many shades of opinion \n",

      "\n",
      "When the power of both the traditionalists and the \n",

      "the great majority of Asians and Africans accepted imperial \n",
      "rule. Political participation in non-Western lands was \n",
      "historically limited to small elites, and the masses were \n",

      "They discovered liberalism, with its credo of civil liberty \n",
      "and political self-determination. They echoed the demands \n",

      "drew on genuine popular support. This support reflected in \n",

       "'  What was Hitlers answer to the crisis of modern society  In Hitlers Germany, a number of scholars have argued  that the general crisis of western European society in the  1920s and 1930s played a major role in bringing fascism  to power in Germany. After the Great War, these crises  included unemployment, inflation, and the breakdown  of political parties and traditional political systems.  Unemployment in Germany reached a high of 8 million  in 1932, more than 10 percent of the labor force. In the  1920s, many middleclass people and intellectuals also  lost much of their real income because they were unable to  keep up with the price increases of everyday items.  Hitlers answer to this general crisis of society was to attack  it from above and from below. He sought to create a new  elite of wellborn, ambitious Nazis who would commandeer  all the privileges and opportunities afforded by the  modern state. Hitler recruited poor and lowermiddle class people for his SA Brownshirts, and he began to promote  them as a potential elite.  Above Hitler and the SA loomed the great modern  state, its bureaucracy and armed forces. Hitlers vision of  the future Nazi leader was an unelected, allpowerful  leader who would unify all the peoples hopes and interests  in the Third Reich.  Below Hitler and the SA stood the broad mass of  people, the SA men and the SA women, the party members  and the party supporters. To Hitler, the SA men were  the true Nazis the ones who would actually wield power and  lead the state. The SA men were thus the vanguard of  Hitlers new elite.  The SA also played an important role in Nazi terror.  Members were given special training in violence and intimidation  and were encouraged to terrorize and even kill  Jews and political opponents. The SA also plundered and  auctioned off Jewish property, and many SA men joined in  the looting and violence.  This Germanys Chancellor is not a statesman but the  leader of a band of murderers and hangmen, said one critic.  He is playing with the destinies of millions of men and  women.15 Hitlers personal rule was increasingly arbitrary,  and he demanded total loyalty from his subordinates.  By the end of 1932, the SA was run by about 8,000  dedicated fanatics, but only about 25,000 Nazi  sympathizers had joined the party.  Then in March 1933, Hitler assumed dictatorial powers,  and he and the Nazi Party ruled by terror.  All opposition was eliminated, and all opposition  leaders were arrested. All independent political parties  were outlawed, and the Nazi Party took over almost  every function of national government. The press and  radio were firmly controlled, and only Nazi propaganda  was permitted. In 1934 Hitler turned his attention to  the churches, which were ordered to join the Nazi  revolution. About 12 million Germans belonged to the  Protestant churches before 1933, but after the churches were  swallowed up by the Nazis, only about 3.5 million remained  unofficial members.   J. P. Sartre, The Wretched of the Earth, 1936.  Sartre argues that western European society was to blame  for fascism and that the only way to save liberal democracy  was to transform it into a socialist dictatorship.   Quoted in P.
