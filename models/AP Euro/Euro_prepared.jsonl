{"prompt":"","completion":" 1934 – 2005 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Bennett Hill, who authored many of the chapters in earlier editions of this  book, was born in Baltimore, Maryland, the son of African American  Catholics. When Bennett was ten, the family moved north to Philadelphia,  where his father worked for the U.S. Postal Service and his mother for the  Veterans Administration. Bennett attended public schools, and his intellectual  prowess was soon evident. He won a scholarship to Princeton University,  where he received an excellent education that he always treasured.  Majoring in history and graduating cum laude, Bennett was a trailblazer—  one of the first African Americans to receive an undergraduate degree from  Princeton. He subsequently earned a doctorate in European history at  Princeton, joined the history department of the University of Illinois at  Urbana-Champaign, and later served as department chair. Bennett was a  popular but demanding teacher with a passion for medieval social history.  His colleagues at Illinois remember especially his keen intellect, elegant taste,  literary flair, and quick, sometimes mischievous wit. (He once persuaded  some of his students that he followed medieval tradition and trimmed his  front lawn with sheep rather than a lawn mower.) Establishing a scholarly  reputation as a leading expert on medieval monasticism, Bennett heeded a  spiritual call in midlife and became a Benedictine monk and ordained priest  at St. Anselm’s Abbey in Washington, D.C. He often served Mass at the  parish church of his grandparents in Baltimore. Yet Bennett never lost his  passion for European and world history, teaching regularly as a visiting professor  at Georgetown University. An indefatigable worker with insatiable curiosity,  he viewed each new edition as an exciting learning opportunity. At  the time of his sudden and unexpected death in February 2005 he was working  on a world history of slavery, which grew out of his research and reflected  his proud heritage and intensely ethical concerns. A complex and many-sided  individual, Bennett was a wonderful conversationalist, an inspiring human  being, and the beloved brother and uncle of a large extended family. His sudden  passing has been a wrenching loss for all who knew him. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" \f Preface "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A History of Western Society grew out of the authors’  desire to infuse new life into the study of Western Civilization.  We knew that historians were using imaginative  questions and innovative research to open up vast new  areas of historical interest and knowledge. We also recognized  that these advances had dramatically affected the  subject of European economic, intellectual, and, especially,  social history, while new research and fresh interpretations  were also revitalizing the study of the traditional mainstream  of political, diplomatic, and religious developments.  Despite history’s vitality as a discipline, however,  it seemed to us at the time that both the broad public  and the intelligentsia were generally losing interest in the  past. That, fortunately for us all, has not proven the case. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was our conviction, based on considerable experience  introducing large numbers of students to the broad  sweep of Western Civilization, that a book in which social  history was the core element could excite readers and inspire  a renewed interest in history. Our strategy was thus  twofold. First, we incorporated recent research by social  historians as we sought to re-create the life of ordinary  people in appealing human terms. At the same time, we  were determined to give great economic, political, cultural,  and intellectual developments the attention they unquestionably  deserve. We wanted to give individual readers  and teachers a balanced, integrated perspective so that they  could pursue—on their own or in the classroom—those  themes and questions that they found particularly exciting  and significant. In an effort to realize fully the potential  of our fresh yet balanced approach, we made many  changes, large and small, in the editions that followed. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Changes in the Ninth Edition "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In preparing the Ninth Edition we have worked hard to  keep our book up-to-date by including as much valuable  and relevant new scholarship as possible. We have also  strengthened our distinctive yet balanced approach to a  wide range of topics. In addition, we have revised the layout  of the chapters somewhat to foreground the historical  questions posed and answered in each chapter, and  added a new map feature. This edition includes the best of "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" previous editions, while blending in the most important  recent findings. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Conceptual and Content Revisions "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Several main lines of revision have guided our many  changes. In particular, we have approached the history of  the West as part of the history of the world and have devoted  more space to Europe’s interactions with the rest  of the world. This has meant that some parts of the book  have been completely reconceptualized and reorganized,  as have many of the sections within chapters. Chapter 15 is  now entirely devoted to European exploration, discovery,  and conquest and also includes coverage of world contacts  before Columbus. Chapter 19 includes discussion of  European trade with Asia, and Chapter 20 incorporates  extended coverage of the impact of colonial products, including  sugar, tea, coffee, and tobacco. Chapter 21 has  considerable new material on the Haitian revolution; Chapter  29 includes more on World War II outside of Europe;  and Chapter 30 has more on decolonization in the Middle  East and Africa. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A second major change is updated discussion of gender  throughout the text. The development of women’s  and gender history has been a central part of the expansion  of historical knowledge over the last several decades,  and this edition includes even fuller discussion of the role  of gender in shaping human experience than did previous  editions. Some of this new material focuses on women,  including women’s role in the court culture of early  modern Europe (Chapter 16) and women’s work in the  Industrial Revolution (Chapter 22). Other sections ask  readers to consider the ways in which gender is related  to other social hierarchies, such as social status and race  (Chapters 13 and 30), or ways in which religious or  intellectual concepts are gendered (Chapter 16). New  scholarship on gender has meant revisions in other sections  as well, including discussion of the Reformation,  the witch-hunts, the scientific revolution, nineteenth- century cities, and cold war Europe. The discussion of  gender is accompanied by updates to the material on  sexuality in many chapters, as this is a field of scholarship  growing very rapidly. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \f xx • Preface "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" These two major lines of revision are accompanied by  continued enhancement of content that began in earlier  editions. The social history focus that has been the core  element of this book since its first edition continues. In  addition to more material on Europe in a global perspective,  we have continued to incorporate more discussion of  groups and regions that are frequently shortchanged in  the general histories of Europe and Western Civilization.  This expanded scope reflects the renewed awareness within  the profession of Europe’s enormous historical diversity,  as well as the efforts of contemporary Europeans to understand  the ambivalent and contested meanings of their  national, regional, ethnic, and pan-European identities.  Several chapters examine notions of race during times of  significant cultural change, including the Renaissance  (Chapter 13), the first wave of colonization (Chapter 15),  the Enlightenment (Chapter 18), and nineteenth-century  urban society (Chapter 24). "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" An important part of this continued broader focus  is material on Islam. Chapters 17, 25, and 27 all include  significant new material on the Ottoman Empire. Several  of the new features focus on Muslims living in Europe, as  well as issues involving Christian-Muslim relations. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" We believe that including examples of problems of historical  interpretations in our text helps our readers develop  the critical-thinking skills that are among the most  precious benefits of studying history. Examples of this  more open-ended, interpretative approach include debates  about the impact of Enlightenment thought (Chapter 18)  and renewed debate on personal and collective responsibility  for the Holocaust (Chapter 29). "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Concern with terminology is key to new ways in which  history is being studied, researched, and presented, and  among the historiographical issues we present are some  that ask readers to consider the implications of words they  (and historians) use regularly without thinking much about  them. This includes discussion of the terms “Renaissance  and “modern (Chapter 13) and disputes about  who was and was not part of “the nation (Chapter 25) or  included in understandings of “Europe (Chapter 31). "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This edition includes several major changes in the organization  of chapters. Chapter 14 now includes material  on the Reformations, religious wars, and witch-hunts,  while, as noted above, Chapter 15 now focuses on exploration  and overseas expansion. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" New Pedagogical Features "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" To help focus and guide the reader, we pose specific historical  questions keyed to the main chapter headings at  the beginning of each chapter. These questions are then "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" answered in the course of each chapter and repeated in  an end-of-chapter summary that concisely reiterates the  chapter’s findings. For this edition, many of the questions  have been reframed, and the chapter summaries rewritten,  to maximize the usefulness of this popular pedagogical  device. Dates have been added to most chapter titles. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This edition also adds a new feature, “Mapping the  Past. Historians have long relied on maps to help explain  the stories that they tell, but we have found that  students often do not pay as much attention to the maps  as they should.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Included in each chapter is the feature “Individuals in  Society, which offers a brief study of a woman, man, or  group, informing us about the societies in which they  lived. Each study or biographical sketch has been carefully  integrated into the body of the text. The “Individuals  in Society feature grew out of our long-standing  focus on people’s lives and the varieties of historical experience,  and we believe that readers will empathize with  these human beings as they themselves seek to define  their own identities.

{"prompt":"","completion":" The range of men and women we consider is broad.  For this edition, and sometimes at readers’ suggestion,  we have dropped some individuals and replaced them with  others who add their own contributions to history. In  keeping with this edition’s increasing attention to individuals  from outside western Europe who had an impact  on European developments, Chapter 17 looks at Hürrem,  first the concubine and then the wife of Suleiman  the Magnificent, and Chapter 21 at Toussaint L’Ouverture,  leader of the revolution in the French colony of  Saint-Domingue. Chapter 23 focuses on the French historian  Jules Michelet, who viewed nationalism as a means  of lessening social tensions, and Chapter 30 on Margaret  Thatcher, the first woman to become prime minister in  Britain. Chapter 31 focuses on Tariq Ramadan, the controversial  European-Muslim intellectual. In addition to  these new individuals, in some cases, such as Leonardo da  Vinci (Chapter 13), we have kept the same individuals, but  completely rewritten the feature to bring it in line with  current scholarship.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Listening to the Past "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A two-page feature called “Listening to the Past extends  and illuminates a major historical issue considered  in each of the text’s chapters through the presentation of  a source or small group of sources. In the new edition we  have reviewed our selections and made judicious substitutions.  Chapter 20 focuses on Louis Sebastien Mercier’s  comments on everyday life in eighteenth-century Paris,  and Chapter 23 on the reflections of a Czech historian  writing during the revolution of 1848. Chapter 27 features  Arab protests regarding the establishment of the League  of Nations mandates in the former Ottoman Empire and  the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. Chapter  31 examines riots in the suburbs of Paris by French  people of Arab descent in late 2005.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Images in Society "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This edition continues to include the photo essay “Images  in Society. Each essay consists of a short narrative with  questions, accompanied by several pictures. The goal of  the feature is to encourage students to think critically: to  view and compare visual illustrations and draw conclusions  about the societies and cultures that produced those  objects. “Art in the Reformation (Chapter 14) examines  both the Protestant and Catholic views of religious  art. Chapter 17 presents the way monarchs displayed their  authority visually in “Absolutist Palace Building. Moving  to modern times, the focus in Chapter 19 changes to  “London: The Remaking of a Great City, which depicts  how Londoners rebuilt their city after a great catastrophe.  “Class and Gender Boundaries in Women’s Fashion,  1850–1914 studies women’s clothing in relationship to  women’s evolving position in society and gender relations  (Chapter 24). “Pablo Picasso and Modern Art looks at  some of Picasso’s greatest paintings to gain insight into  his principles and the modernist revolution in art (Chapter  28).

The Book of Revelation deals with visions of the  end of the world, with disease, war, famine, and death. It is no wonder  this part of the Bible was so popular.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Evidence from nature emerges through the study of  Alpine and polar glaciers, tree rings, and pollen left in  bogs. Human-produced sources include written reports  of rivers freezing and crops never ripening, as well as  archaeological evidence such as the abandoned villages  of Greenland, where ice floes cut off contact with the  rest of the world and the harshening climate meant that  the few hardy crops grown earlier could no longer survive.  The Viking colony on Greenland died out completely,  though Inuit people who relied on hunting sea  mammals continued to live in the far north, as they had  before the arrival of Viking colonists. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" An unusual number of storms brought torrential rains,  ruining the wheat, oat, and hay crops on which people  and animals almost everywhere depended. Since long- distance transportation of food was expensive and difficult,  most urban areas depended for bread and meat on  areas no more than a day’s journey away. Poor harvests—  and one in four was likely to be poor—led to scarcity and  starvation. Almost all of northern Europe suffered a "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Reduced caloric intake meant increased susceptibility  to disease, especially for infants, children, and the elderly.  Workers on reduced diets had less energy, which in turn  meant lower productivity, lower output, and higher grain  prices. The Great Famine proved to be a demographic  disaster in France; in Burgundy perhaps one-third of the  population died. The many religious houses of Flanders  experienced a high loss of monks, nuns, and priests. In  Scandinavia and the Baltic countries, low cereal harvests,  declines in meat and dairy production, economic recessions,  and the lack of salt, used for preserving herring, resulted  in terrible food shortages. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hardly had western Europe begun to recover from  this disaster when another struck: an epidemic of typhoid  fever carried away thousands. In 1316, 10 percent of the  population of the city of Ypres may have died between "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \f May and October alone. Then in 1318 disease hit cattle  and sheep, drastically reducing the herds and flocks. Another  bad harvest in 1321 brought famine and death. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The province of Languedoc in France presents a  classic example of agrarian crisis. For more than 150  years Languedoc had enjoyed continual land reclamation,  steady agricultural expansion, and enormous population  growth. Then the fourteenth century opened with four  years of bad harvests. Torrential rains in 1310 ruined the  harvest and brought on terrible famine. Harvests failed  again in 1322 and 1329. In 1332 desperate peasants survived  the winter on raw herbs. In the half century from  1302 to 1348, poor harvests occurred twenty times.  These catastrophes had grave social consequences. Poor  harvests and famine led to the abandonment of homesteads.  In parts of the Low Countries and in the Scottish- English borderlands, entire villages were abandoned. This  meant a great increase in the number of vagabonds, what  we call “homeless people. In Flanders and East Anglia  (eastern England), where aspects of the famine have been  carefully analyzed, some peasants were forced to mortgage,  sublease, or sell their holdings to get money to buy  food. Rich farmers bought out their poorer neighbors.  When conditions improved, debtors tried to get their  lands back, leading to a very volatile land market. To reduce  the labor supply and the mouths to feed in the  countryside, young men and women sought work in the  towns. Poor harvests probably meant that marriage had  to be postponed. Later marriages and the deaths caused  by famine and disease meant a reduction in population.  Meanwhile, the international character of trade and commerce  meant that a disaster in one country had serious  implications elsewhere. For example, the infection that  attacked English sheep in 1318 caused a sharp decline  in wool exports in the following years. Without wool,  Flemish weavers could not work, and thousands were  laid off. Without woolen cloth, the businesses of Flemish,  Hanseatic, and Italian merchants suffered. Unemployment  encouraged people to turn to crime. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Government Ineptitude "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" To none of these problems did governments have effective  solutions. The three sons of Philip the Fair who sat  on the French throne between 1314 and 1328 condemned  speculators, who held stocks of grain back until  conditions were desperate and prices high; forbade the  sale of grain abroad; and published legislation prohibiting  fishing with traps that took large catches. These measures  had few positive results. As the subsistence crisis  deepened, popular discontent and paranoia increased. "}

Baronial conflicts and wars with the Scots dominated  Edward II’s reign. Fearing food riots and violence,  Edward condemned speculators, which proved easier  than enforcing price controls.

In  1291 Genoese sailors had opened the Strait of Gibraltar  to Italian shipping by defeating the Moroccans. Then,  shortly after 1300, important advances were made in the  design of Italian merchant ships. A square rig was added  to the mainmast, and ships began to carry three masts instead  of just one. Additional sails better utilized wind  power to propel the ship. The improved design permitted  year-round shipping for the first time, and Venetian  and Genoese merchant ships could sail the dangerous Atlantic  coast even in the winter months. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Ships continually at sea carried all types of cargo, and  they also carried vermin of all types, especially insects and  rats, which often harbored disease pathogens. Rats, fleas,  and cockroaches could live for months on the cargo carried  along the coasts, disembarking at ports with the  grain, cloth, or other merchandise. Just as modern air  travel has allowed diseases such as AIDS and SARS to  spread quickly over very long distances, medieval shipping  did the same. The most frightful of these diseases first  emerged in western Europe in 1347, carried on Genoese  ships, a disease that was later called the Black Death. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" • How did the spread of the plague shape European  society? "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Pathology "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Most historians and almost all microbiologists identify  the disease that spread in the fourteenth century as the  bubonic plague, caused by the bacillus Yersinia pestis.  The disease normally afflicts rats. Fleas living on the infected  rats drink their blood; the bacteria that cause the  plague multiply in the flea’s gut; and the flea passes them  on to the next rat it bites by throwing up into the bite.  Usually the disease is limited to rats and other rodents,  but at certain points in history—perhaps when most rats  have been killed off—the fleas have jumped from their  rodent hosts to humans and other animals. One of these  times appears to have been in the Eastern Roman Empire  in the sixth century, when a plague killed millions of  people. Another was in China and India in the 1890s, "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" when millions died. Doctors and epidemiologists closely  studied this outbreak, identified the bacillus as bubonic  plague, and learned about the exact cycle of infection for  the first time. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The fourteenth-century outbreak showed many similarities  to the nineteenth-century outbreak, but also  some differences. There are no reports of massive rat die- offs in fourteenth-century records. The plague was often  transmitted directly from one person to another through  coughing and sneezing (what epidemiologists term pneumonic  transmission) as well as through flea bites. The  fourteenth-century outbreak spread much faster than the  nineteenth-century outbreak and was much more deadly,  killing as much as one-third of the population when it  first spread to an area. These differences have led some  historians to question whether the fourteenth-century  disease was actually bubonic plague or whether it was  some other disease, perhaps something like the Ebola  virus. In the late 1990s French paleomicrobiologists  studying the tooth pulp from bodies in two plague cemeteries  found DNA from Y. pestis, a finding that has been  viewed as convincing by most medical historians, though  similar studies of English plague cemeteries have not  yielded the same results.

The classic symptom  of the bubonic plague was a growth the size of a nut  or an apple in the armpit, in the groin, or on the neck.  This was the boil, or bubo, that gave the disease its name  and caused agonizing pain. If the bubo was lanced and  the pus thoroughly drained, the victim had a chance of  recovery. The next stage was the appearance of black  spots or blotches caused by bleeding under the skin.  (This syndrome did not give the disease its common  name; contemporaries did not call the plague the Black  Death. Sometime in the fifteenth century, the Latin  phrase atra mors, meaning “dreadful death, was translated  as “black death, and the phrase stuck.)

Medical doctors observed that crowded cities had  high death rates, especially when the weather was warm  and moist. We understand that warm, moist conditions  make it easier for germs, viruses, and bacteria to grow  and spread, but fourteenth-century people—lay, scholarly,  and medical—thought in terms of “poisons in the  air or “corrupted air rather than germs. This “corrupted  air came from swamps, unburied animal or human  corpses, too much rain, the position of planets or stars, or  perhaps other causes. The poisons caused illness, which  doctors thought of as an imbalance in the fluids in the  body, especially blood. Certain symptoms of the plague,  especially bleeding and vomiting, were believed to be the  body’s natural reaction to too much fluid. These were often  symptoms of other illnesses as well, and doctors frequently  prescribed bloodletting, that is, taking blood  from the body by applying leeches or making small cuts  in veins, as standard treatment.

Medicines made from plants that were bumpy  or that oozed liquid might work, keeping the more dangerous  swelling and oozing of the plague away. Because  the plague seemed to strike randomly, perhaps wearing  jewelry with random number and letter combinations, or  drinking water in which ink used to write these magical  combinations had been dissolved, would help.

Sixty hospitals served Paris in 1328—but probably not  enough for its population of two hundred thousand. The  many hospitals in the Iberian Peninsula continued the  Muslim tradition of care for the poor and ill. Merchants  in the larger towns of the German Empire, in Poland,  and in Hungary also founded hospitals in the fourteenth  century, generally later than those in western Europe.  Sailors, long viewed as potential carriers of disease, benefited  from hospitals reserved for them; in 1300 the  Venetian government paid a surgeon to care for sick  sailors. At the time the plague erupted, therefore, most  towns and cities had hospital facilities. "}

Since each medieval hospital  bed might serve two or more patients, we cannot calculate  the number of patients on the basis of the beds alone.  We do know that rural hospices usually had twelve to fifteen  beds, and city hospitals, as at Lisbon, Narbonne,  and Genoa, had on average twenty-five to thirty beds,  but these figures do not tell us how many patients were  accommodated.

By the early  fifteenth century seigneurial prosperity reached a medieval  peak. Why?

Such statutes could  not be enforced and thus were unsuccessful. The price of  wheat in most of Europe increased, as did the costs of  meat, sausage, and cheese. This inflation continued to  the end of the fourteenth century. But wages in the  towns rose faster, and the broad mass of people enjoyed  a higher standard of living. Population decline meant a  sharp increase in per capita wealth. The greater demand  for labor meant greater mobility for peasants in rural  areas and for industrial workers in the towns and cities.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Joan of Arc and France’s Victory "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The ultimate French success rests heavily on the actions  of an obscure French peasant girl, Joan of Arc, whose vision  and work revived French fortunes and led to victory.  A great deal of pious and popular legend surrounds Joan  the Maid because of her peculiar appearance on the  scene, her astonishing success, her martyrdom, and her  canonization by the Catholic Church. The historical fact  is that she saved the French monarchy, which was the  embodiment of France. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Born in 1412 to well-to-do peasants in the village of  Domrémy in Champagne, Joan of Arc grew up in a religious  household. During adolescence she began to hear  voices, which she later said belonged to Saint Michael,  Saint Catherine, and Saint Margaret. In 1428 these voices  spoke to her with great urgency, telling her that the  dauphin (the uncrowned King Charles VII) had to be  crowned and the English expelled from France. Joan went  to the French court, persuaded the king to reject the rumor  that he was illegitimate, and secured his support for  her relief of the besieged city of Orléans. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The astonishing thing is not that Joan the Maid overcame  serious obstacles to see the dauphin, and not even  that Charles and his advisers listened to her. What is  amazing is the swiftness with which they were convinced.  French fortunes had been so low for so long that the  court believed that only a miracle could save the country.  Because Joan cut her hair short and dressed like a man,  she scandalized the court. But hoping she would provide  the miracle, Charles allowed her to accompany the army  that was preparing to raise the English siege of Orléans. "}

"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Primary Source: The Trial of Joan of Arc "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Joan’s presence at Orléans, her strong belief in her  mission, and the fact that she was wounded enhanced her  reputation and strengthened the morale of the army. In  1430 England’s allies, the Burgundians, captured Joan  and sold her to the English. When the English handed  her over to the ecclesiastical authorities for trial, the  French court did not intervene. While the English wanted  Joan eliminated for obvious political reasons, sorcery  (witchcraft) was the ostensible charge at her trial. Witch  persecution was increasing in the fifteenth century, and  Joan’s wearing of men’s clothes appeared not only aberrant  but indicative of contact with the Devil. In 1431 the  court condemned her as a heretic—her claim of direct inspiration  from God, thereby denying the authority of  church officials, constituted heresy—and burned her at  the stake in the marketplace at Rouen. A new trial in  1456 rehabilitated her name. In 1920 she was canonized  and declared a holy maiden, and today she is revered as  the second patron saint of France, along with King Louis "}

The relief of Orléans stimulated French pride and rallied  French resources. As the war dragged on, loss of life  mounted, and money appeared to be flowing into a bottomless  pit, demands for an end increased in England.  The clergy and intellectuals pressed for peace.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Black Death, this additional killing meant a grave loss of  population. The English had laid waste to hundreds of  thousands of acres of rich farmland, leaving the rural  economy of many parts of France a shambles. The war  had disrupted trade and the great fairs, resulting in the  drastic reduction of French participation in international  commerce. Defeat in battle and heavy taxation contributed  to widespread dissatisfaction and aggravated  peasant grievances. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In England only the southern coastal ports experienced  much destruction, and the demographic effects of the  Black Death actually worked to restore the land-labor balance  (see page 379). The costs of the war, however, were  tremendous. England spent over £5 million on the war effort,  a huge sum at the time. Manpower losses had greater  social consequences. The knights who ordinarily handled  the work of local government as sheriffs, coroners, jurymen,  and justices of the peace were abroad, and their absence  contributed to the breakdown of order at the local  level. The English government attempted to finance the  war effort by raising taxes on the wool crop. Because of  steadily increasing costs, Flemish and Italian buyers could  not afford English wool. Consequently, raw wool exports  slumped drastically between 1350 and 1450. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Many men of all social classes had volunteered for service  in France in the hope of acquiring booty and becoming  rich. The chronicler Walsingham, describing the  period of Crécy, wrote: “For the woman was of no account  who did not possess something from the spoils  of . . . cities overseas in clothing, furs, quilts, and utensils  . . . tablecloths and jewels, bowls of murra [semiprecious  stone] and silver, linen and linen cloths.5  Walsingham is referring to 1348, in the first generation  of war. As time went on, most fortunes seem to have  been squandered as fast as they were made. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If English troops returned with cash, they did not invest  it in land. In the fifteenth century returning soldiers  were commonly described as beggars and vagabonds,  roaming about making mischief. Even the large sums of  money received from the ransom of the great—such as  the £250,000 paid to Edward III for the freedom of  King John of France—and the money paid as indemnities  by captured towns and castles did not begin to equal the  more than £5 million spent. England suffered a serious  net loss. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The war stimulated technological experimentation, especially  with artillery. Cannon revolutionized warfare,  making the stone castle no longer impregnable. Because  only central governments, not private nobles, could afford  cannon, they strengthened the military power of national  states. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The long war also had a profound impact on the political  and cultural lives of the two countries. Most notably,  it stimulated the development of the English Parliament.  Between 1250 and 1450, representative assemblies  flourished in many European countries. In the English  Parliament, German diets, and Spanish cortes, deliberative  practices developed that laid the foundations for the  representative institutions of modern liberal-democratic  nations. While representative assemblies declined in most  countries after the fifteenth century, the English Parliament  endured. Edward III’s constant need for money to  pay for the war compelled him to summon not only the  great barons and bishops, but knights of the shires and  burgesses from the towns as well. Parliament met in  thirty-seven of the fifty years of Edward’s reign.6 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The frequency of the meetings is significant. Representative  assemblies were becoming a habit. Knights and  wealthy urban residents—or the “Commons, as they  came to be called—recognized their mutual interests and  began to meet apart from the great lords. The Commons  gradually realized that they held the country’s purse  strings, and a parliamentary statute of 1341 required that  all nonfeudal levies have parliamentary approval. By signing  the law, Edward III acknowledged that the king  of England could not tax without Parliament’s consent.  During the course of the war, money grants were increasingly  tied to royal redress of grievances: to raise money,  the government had to correct the wrongs its subjects  protested. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In England, theoretical consent to taxation and legislation  was given in one assembly for the entire country.  France had no such single assembly; instead, there were  many regional or provincial assemblies. Why did a national  representative assembly fail to develop in France?  The initiative for convening assemblies rested with the  king, who needed revenue almost as much as the English  ruler. But the French monarchy found the idea of representative  assemblies thoroughly distasteful. Large gatherings  of the nobility potentially or actually threatened  the king’s power. The advice of a counselor to King  Charles VI (r. 1380–1422), “above all things be sure that  no great assemblies of nobles or of communes take place  in your kingdom, was accepted.7 Charles VII (r. 1422–  1461) even threatened to punish those proposing a national  assembly. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" No one in France wanted a national assembly. Linguistic,  geographical, economic, legal, and political differences  were very strong. People tended to think of  themselves as Breton, Norman, Burgundian, or whatever,  rather than French. Through much of the fourteenth  and early fifteenth centuries, weak monarchs lacked the "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \f power to call a national assembly. Provincial assemblies,  highly jealous of their independence, did not want a  national assembly. The costs of sending delegates to it  would be high, and the result was likely to be increased  taxation. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In both countries, however, the war did promote the  growth of nationalism—the feeling of unity and identity  that binds together a people. After victories, each country  experienced a surge of pride in its military strength.  Just as English patriotism ran strong after Crécy and  Poitiers, so French national confidence rose after Orléans.  French national feeling demanded the expulsion of  the enemy not merely from Normandy and Aquitaine  but from all French soil. Perhaps no one expressed this  national consciousness better than Joan of Arc when she  exulted that the enemy had been “driven out of France. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Challenges to the Church "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In times of crisis or disaster, people of all faiths have  sought the consolation of religion. In the fourteenth  century, however, the official Christian church offered  little solace. In fact, the leaders of the church added to  the sorrow and misery of the times. In response to this  lack of leadership, members of the clergy challenged the  power of the pope, and laypeople challenged the authority  of the church itself. Women and men increasingly relied  on direct approaches to God, often through mystical  encounters, rather than on the institutional church. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" In order to control the church and its policies, Philip the  Fair of France pressured Pope Clement V to settle permanently  in Avignon in southeastern France, where the  popes already had their summer residence (see Map 11.3  on page 346). Clement, critically ill with cancer, lacked  the will to resist Philip.

Though some of  the popes led austere lives, the general atmosphere was  one of luxury and extravagance. (See the feature “Individuals  in Society: Francesco Datini in Chapter 11 on  page 343.) The leadership of the church was cut off from  its historic roots and the source of its ancient authority,  the city of Rome. In the absence of the papacy, the Papal  States in Italy lacked stability and good government. The  economy of Rome had been based on the presence of the  papal court and the rich tourist trade the papacy attracted.  The Babylonian Captivity left Rome poverty-stricken. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In 1377 Pope Gregory XI brought the papal court  back to Rome. Unfortunately, he died shortly after the  return. At Gregory’s death, Roman citizens demanded  an Italian pope who would remain in Rome. Between the  time of Gregory’s death and the opening of the conclave,  great pressure was put on the cardinals to elect an Italian.  At the time, none of them protested this pressure, and  they chose a distinguished administrator, the archbishop  of Bari, Bartolomeo Prignano, who took the name Urban  VI. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Urban VI (1378–1389) had excellent intentions for  church reform, but he went about this in a tactless and  bullheaded manner. He attacked clerical luxury, denouncing  individual cardinals by name, and even threatened  to excommunicate certain cardinals. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The cardinals slipped away from Rome and met at  Anagni. They declared Urban’s election invalid because  it had come about under threats from the Roman mob,  and they asserted that Urban himself was excommunicated.  The cardinals then elected Cardinal Robert of  Geneva, the cousin of King Charles V of France, as pope.  Cardinal Robert took the name Clement VII. There  were thus two popes—Urban at Rome and Clement VII  (1378–1394), who set himself up at Avignon in opposition  to Urban. So began the Great Schism, which divided  Western Christendom until 1417. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The powers of Europe aligned themselves with Urban  or Clement along strictly political lines. France naturally  recognized the French pope, Clement. England, France’s  historic enemy, recognized the Italian pope, Urban.  Scotland, whose attacks on England were subsidized by  France, followed the French and supported Clement.  Aragon, Castile, and Portugal hesitated before deciding  for Clement at Avignon. The emperor, who bore ancient  hostility to France, recognized Urban. At first the Italian  city-states recognized Urban; when he alienated them,  they opted for Clement. "}

The schism weakened the religious  faith of many Christians and brought church leadership  into serious disrepute. The schism also brought to  the fore conciliar ideas about church government. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Conciliar Movement "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Theories about the nature of the Christian church and its  government originated in the very early church, but the  years of the Great Schism witnessed their maturity.  Conciliarists believed that reform of the church could  best be achieved through periodic assemblies, or general  councils, representing all the Christian people. While acknowledging  that the pope was head of the church, conciliarists  held that the pope derived his authority from the  entire Christian community, whose well-being he existed  to promote. Conciliarists favored a balanced or constitutional  form of church government, with papal authority  shared with a general council, in contrast to the monarchical  one that prevailed. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A half century before the Great Schism, in 1324, Marsiglio  of Padua, then rector of the University of Paris, had  published Defensor Pacis (The Defender of the Peace).  Marsiglio argued that the state was the great unifying  power in society and that the church was subordinate to  the state. He put forth the revolutionary ideas that the  church had no inherent jurisdiction and should own no  property. Authority in the Christian church, according to  Marsiglio, should rest in a general council made up of  laymen as well as priests, and the council should be superior  to the pope. These ideas directly contradicted the  medieval notion of a society governed by the church and  the state, with the church supreme. Defensor Pacis was  condemned by the pope, and Marsiglio was excommunicated. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Even more earthshaking than the theories of Marsiglio  of Padua were the ideas of the English scholar and theologian  John Wyclif (ca 1330–1384). Wyclif wrote that  papal claims of temporal power had no foundation in  the Scriptures and that the Scriptures alone should be the  standard of Christian belief and practice. He urged the  abolition of such practices as the veneration of saints, pilgrimages,  pluralism, and absenteeism. Sincere Christians,  according to Wyclif, should read the Bible for themselves.  In response to that idea, the first English translation  of the Bible was produced and circulated. Wyclif’s "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" views had broad social and economic significance. He  urged that the church be stripped of its property. His  idea that every Christian free of mortal sin possessed  lordship was seized on by peasants in England during a  revolt in 1381 and used to justify their goals. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In advancing these views, Wyclif struck at the roots of  medieval church structure. Consequently, he has been  hailed as the precursor of the Protestant Reformation of  the sixteenth century. Although Wyclif’s ideas were vigorously  condemned by ecclesiastical authorities, they  were widely disseminated by humble clerics and enjoyed  great popularity in the early fifteenth century. Wyclif’s  followers were called “Lollards. The term, which means  “mumblers of prayers and psalms, refers to what they  criticized. Lollard teaching allowed women to preach.  Women, some well educated, played a significant role in  the movement. After Anne, sister of Wenceslaus, king of  Germany and Bohemia, married Richard II of England,  members of her household carried Lollard books back to  Bohemia. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In response to continued calls throughout Europe for  a council, the two colleges of cardinals—one at Rome,  the other at Avignon—summoned a council at Pisa in  1409. That gathering of prelates and theologians deposed  both popes and selected another. Neither the Avignon  pope nor the Roman pope would resign, however,  and the appalling result was the creation of a threefold  schism. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Finally, because of the pressure of the German emperor  Sigismund, a great council met at the imperial city  of Constance (1414–1418). It had three objectives: to  end the schism, to reform the church “in head and members  (from top to bottom), and to wipe out heresy. The  council condemned the Czech reformer Jan Hus (see the  feature “Individuals in Society: Jan Hus), and he was  burned at the stake. The council eventually deposed both  the Roman pope and the successor of the pope chosen at  Pisa, and it isolated the Avignon antipope. A conclave  elected a new leader, the Roman cardinal Colonna, who  took the name Martin V (1417–1431). "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Martin proceeded to dissolve the council. Nothing was  done about reform. The schism was over, and though  councils subsequently met at Basel and at Ferrara- Florence, in 1450 the papacy held a jubilee celebrating its  triumph over the conciliar movement. In the later fifteenth  century the papacy concentrated on Italian problems  to the exclusion of universal Christian interests. But  the schism and the conciliar movement had exposed the  crying need for ecclesiastical reform, thus laying the  foundation for the great reform efforts of the sixteenth  century. "}

The constant quarrels of the mendicant orders (the Franciscans  and Dominicans), the mercenary and grasping attitude  of the parish clergy, the scandal of the Great  Schism, and a divided Christendom all did much to  weaken the spiritual mystique of the clergy in the popular  mind. The laity steadily took responsibility for the  management of parish lands and secured jurisdiction over  the structure of the church building and its vestments,  books, and furnishings. Lay Christian men and women  often formed confraternities, voluntary lay groups organized  by occupation, devotional preference, neighborhood,  or charitable activity.

The spirituality of  the Brethren and Sisters of the Common Life found its  finest expression in the classic The Imitation of Christ by  Thomas à Kempis, which gained wide appeal among  laypeople. It urges Christians to take Christ as their  model, seek perfection in a simple way of life, and look to  the Scriptures for guidance in living a spiritual life.

Early in the thirteenth century the French  preacher Jacques de Vitry asked rhetorically, “How many  serfs have killed their lords or burnt their castles?10 And  in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries social and economic  conditions caused a great increase in peasant uprisings  (see Map 12.3).

Two years earlier the English  had captured the French king John and many nobles  and held them for ransom. The peasants resented paying  for their lords’ release. Recently hit by plague, experiencing  famine in some areas, and harassed by nobles, peasants  in Picardy, Champagne, and the Île-de-France  erupted in anger and frustration. Crowds swept through  the countryside, slashing the throats of nobles, burning  their castles, raping their wives and daughters, and killing  or maiming their horses and cattle. Peasants blamed the  nobility for oppressive taxes, for the criminal brigandage  of the countryside, for defeat in war, and for the general  misery. Artisans, small merchants, and parish priests  joined the peasants. Urban and rural groups committed  terrible destruction, and for several weeks the nobles  were on the defensive. Then the upper class united to repress  the revolt with merciless ferocity. Thousands of the  “Jacques, innocent as well as guilty, were cut down.  That forcible suppression of social rebellion, without any  effort to alleviate its underlying causes, served to drive  protest underground. "}

In general,  though, the thirteenth century had witnessed the steady  commutation of labor services for cash rents, and the  Black Death had drastically cut the labor supply. As a result,  peasants demanded higher wages and fewer manorial  obligations. The parliamentary Statute of Laborers of  1351 (see page 380) had declared: "}

This event marks the first time  that an ecclesiastical decision was publicly defied. Revolution  swept through Bohemia, with Hussites—Czech  nobles and people—insisting on clerical poverty and  both the bread and wine at the Eucharist, and with  German citizens remaining loyal to the Roman church.  In the sixteenth century reformers hailed Hus as the  forerunner of Protestantism. In the eighteenth century  Enlightenment philosophes evoked Hus as a defender  of freedom of expression.

{"prompt":"","completion":" These revolts often occurred in cities where the conditions  of work were changing for many people. In the  thirteenth century craft guilds had organized production  of most goods, with masters, journeymen, and apprentices  working side by side. Beginning in the fourteenth  century in a few areas of Europe such as Florence and  Flanders, individuals who had made money in trade and  banking invested in production. They wanted to make  products on a larger scale than guilds would allow, so  they hired many households, with each household performing  only one step of the process. Craft guilds sometimes  protested these changes, but in other cities more  enterprising or wealthier masters recognized the benefits  of this new system and began to hire other households to  work for them. This promoted a greater division within  guilds between wealthier masters and the poorer masters  and journeymen they hired. Some masters became so  wealthy that they no longer had to work in a shop themselves,  nor did their wives and family members. Instead  of being artisans, they became capitalist investors,  though they still generally belonged to the craft guild. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" While capitalism provided opportunities for some artisans  to become investors and entrepreneurs, especially in  cloth production, for many it led to a decrease in income  and status. Guilds often responded to competition by  limiting membership to existing guild families, which  meant that journeymen who were not master’s sons or  who could not find a master’s widow or daughter to  marry could never become masters themselves. They remained  journeymen their entire lives, losing their sense  of solidarity with the masters of their craft and in some  cities forming separate journeymen’s guilds. These journeymen’s  guilds tried to prevent anyone who was not a  member of the guild from working in any craft shop, enforcing  their aims with boycotts, strikes, and riots. Such  actions often led cities to prohibit journeymen’s guilds,  but they were still set up illegally, and their secrecy made  them stronger. Journeymen developed elaborate initiation  rituals and secret ceremonies to enhance group solidarity,  and they carried their organizations with them  when they traveled in search of work. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Urban uprisings were most often touched off by economic  issues, as low- and middle-class workers deeply resented  the widening economic and social gap separating  them from mercantile elites, but they were also sparked  by issues involving honor, such as employers’ requiring "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Economic and Social Change •  393 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" workers to do tasks they regarded as beneath them. As  their actual status and economic prospects declined and  their work became basically wage labor, journeymen and  poorer masters emphasized skill and honor as qualities  that set them apart from less-skilled workers. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The sense of honor developed by craft and journeymen’s  guilds was a gendered one. When urban economies  were expanding in the High Middle Ages, the master’s  wife and daughters worked alongside him, and the journeymen  and apprentices and female domestic servants  also carried out productive tasks. (See the feature “Listening  to the Past: Christine de Pizan on pages 404–  405.) Women and girls served as a labor reservoir to be  utilized when guild needs required. Masters’ widows ran  shops after the death of their husbands and were expected  to pay all guild fees, though they could not participate  in running the guild. This informal participation  began to change in the fourteenth century, as guilds increasingly  came to view the honor of their work as tied to  an all-male workplace. First, masters’ widows were limited  in the amount of time they could keep operating a  shop or were prohibited from hiring journeymen; then  female domestic servants were excluded from any productive  tasks; then the number of his daughters a master  craftsman could employ was limited. The timing of these  restrictions varied from craft to craft, town to town, and  country to country, but because women’s participation  in guild shops was generally not guaranteed by guild regulations  and because widows had no political voice in  running the guilds, women as a group were not able to  protect their right to work. A few might be allowed to  work, but this was on an individual basis and was viewed  as a substitute for charity. The separate journeymen’s  guilds were even more hostile to women’s work and  never allowed female members. Their secret rituals offered  opportunities for men to bond with one another  and to express their resentment of economic change  through hostility toward women’s work as well as toward  merchants’ privileges. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Sex in the City "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Peasant and urban revolts and riots had clear economic  bases, but some historians have suggested that late medieval  marital patterns may have also played a role in unrest.  At what age did people usually marry? The largest  amount of evidence on age at first marriage survives from  Italy. For girls, population surveys at Prato place the age  at 16.3 years in 1372 and at 21.1 years in 1470. Noble  and wealthy urban women in cities elsewhere in Europe  also generally married while in their late teens, but peasant "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \f 394 CHAPTER 12 •  THE CRISIS OF THE LATER MIDDLE AGES, 1300–1450 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" and poorer urban women, especially in northwestern  Europe—including the British Isles, Scandinavia, France,  and Germany—waited until their mid- or late twenties to  marry. The northwestern European marriage pattern resulted  largely from the idea that couples should be economically  independent before they married, so both  spouses spent long periods as servants or workers in  other households saving money and learning skills, or  they waited until their own parents had died and the family  property was distributed. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The most unusual feature of this pattern was the late  age of marriage for women. Women entered marriage as  adults and took charge of running a household immediately.  They were thus not as dependent on their husbands  or their mothers-in-law as were women who married at  younger ages. They had fewer pregnancies than women  who married earlier, though not necessarily fewer surviving  children. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Men of all social groups were older when they married.  An Italian chronicler writing about 1354 says that men  did not marry before the age of thirty. At Prato in 1371  the average age of men at first marriage was twenty-four  years, very young for Italian men, but these data may signal  an attempt to regain population losses due to the recent  attack of the plague. In general, men were in their  middle or late twenties at first marriage, with wealthier  urban merchants often much older. Journeymen and apprentices  were often explicitly prohibited from marrying,  as were the students at universities, as they were understood  to be in “minor orders and thus like clergy, even  if they were not intending on careers in the church. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The prohibitions on marriage for certain groups of  men and the late age of marriage for most men meant  that cities and villages were filled with large numbers of  young adult men with no family responsibilities who often  formed the core of riots and unrest. Not surprisingly,  this situation also contributed to a steady market for sexual  services outside of marriage, what in later centuries  was termed prostitution. Research on the southern  French province of Languedoc in the fourteenth and fifteenth  centuries has revealed the establishment of legal  houses of prostitution in many cities. Municipal authorities  in Toulouse, Montpellier, Albi, and other towns set  up houses or red-light districts either outside the city  walls or away from respectable neighborhoods. For example,  authorities in Montpellier set aside Hot Street for  prostitution, required public women to live there, and  forbade anyone to molest them. Prostitution thus passed  from being a private concern to a social matter requiring  public supervision. The towns of Languedoc were not  unique. Public authorities in Amiens, Dijon, Paris, "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Venice, Genoa, London, Florence, Rome, most of the  larger German towns, and the English port of Sandwich  set up brothels. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Many cities set down rules for the women and their  customers, and they justified the existence of municipal  brothels with the comment that such women protected  honorable girls and women from the uncontrollable lust  of young men, an argument at least as old as Saint Augustine.  In a few cities such as Florence, authorities also  noted that brothels might keep young men from homosexual  relations, another, far worse alternative in their  eyes. Visiting brothels was associated with achieving manhood  in the eyes of young men, though for the women  themselves their activities were work. Indeed, in some  cases the women had no choice, for they had been  traded to the brothel manager by their parents or other  people in payment for debt, or had quickly become indebted  to him (or, more rarely, her) for the clothes and  other finery regarded as essential to their occupation. Poor  women—and men—also sold sex illegally outside of city  brothels, combining this with other sorts of part-time  work such as laundering or sewing. Prostitution was an  urban phenomenon because only populous towns had  large numbers of unmarried young men, communities of  transient merchants, and a culture accustomed to a cash  exchange. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Though selling sex for money was legal in the Middle  Ages, the position of women who did so was always marginal.  In the late fifteenth century cities began to limit  brothel residents’ freedom of movement and choice of  clothing, requiring them to wear distinctive head coverings  or bands on their clothing so that they would not be  mistaken for “honorable women. The cities also began  to impose harsher penalties on women who did not live  in the designated house or section of town. A few prostitutes  did earn enough to donate money to charity or buy  property, but most were very poor. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Along with buying sex, young men also took it by  force. Unmarried women often found it difficult to avoid  sexual contacts. Many of them worked as domestic servants,  where their employers or employers’ sons or male  relatives could easily coerce them, or they worked in  proximity to men. Female servants were sent on errands  alone or with men or worked by themselves in fields far  from other people. Notions of female honor kept upper- class women secluded in their homes, particularly in  southern and eastern Europe, but there was little attempt  anywhere to keep female servants or day laborers from  the risk of seduction or rape. Rape was a capital crime in  many parts of Europe, but the actual sentences handed  out were more likely to be fines and brief imprisonment, "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prostitute Invites a Traveling Merchant Poverty drove  women into prostitution, which, though denounced by moralists,  was accepted as a normal part of the medieval social fabric.  In the cities and larger towns where prostitution  flourished, public officials passed laws requiring prostitutes to  wear a special mark on their clothing, regulated hours of business,  forbade women to drag men into their houses, and denied  business to women with the “burning sickness,  gonorrhea.

According to a  study of the legal evidence from Venice in the years 1338  to 1358, rape was not considered a particularly serious  crime against either the victim or society. Noble youths  committed a higher percentage of rapes than their small  numbers in Venetian society would imply. The rape of a  young girl of marriageable age or a child under twelve  was considered a graver crime than the rape of a married  woman. Nevertheless, the punishment for rape of a noble  marriageable girl was only a fine or about six months’ imprisonment.  In an age when theft and robbery could be  punished by mutilation and forgery and sodomy by  burning, this penalty was mild indeed. When an upper-"}

By contrast, the sexual assault  of a noblewoman by a working- class man, which was extraordinarily  rare, resulted in severe penalization because  the crime had social and political  overtones. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" According to laws regarding rape in  most parts of Europe, the victim had to  prove that she had cried out and had attempted  to repel the attacker, and she  had to bring the charge within a short  period of time after the attack had happened.  Women bringing rape charges  were often more interested in getting  their own honorable reputations back  than in punishing the perpetrators, and  for this reason they sometimes asked  the judge to force their rapists to marry  them. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Same-sex relations—what in the late  nineteenth century would be termed  homosexuality—were another feature of "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" medieval urban life (and of village life,  though there are very few sources relating to sexual relations  of any type in the rural context). Same-sex relations  were of relatively little concern to church or state authorities  in the early Middle Ages, but this attitude changed  beginning in the late twelfth century. By 1300 most areas  had defined such actions as “crimes against nature, with  authorities seeing them as particularly reprehensible because  they thought they did not occur anywhere else in  creation. Same-sex relations, usually termed sodomy,  became  a capital crime in most of Europe, with adult offenders  threatened with execution by fire. The Italian  cities of Venice, Florence, and Lucca created special  courts to deal with sodomy, which saw thousands of investigations. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" How prevalent was homosexuality? This is difficult  to answer, even in modern society, but Florence provides  a provocative case study. The city of Florence passed legislation  against sodomy in 1415 and 1418, and in 1432  it set up a special magistracy, the Office of the Night,  to “root out ...the abominable vice of sodomy. This  board of professional men at least forty-five years of  age and married was elected annually and charged with  pursuing and punishing sodomitical activity between  males.12 The name of the magistracy derived from the  nocturnal activities of most male encounters, especially in  the spring and summer months and on feast days and "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Sundays. Between 1432 and the abolition of the magistracy  in 1502, about seventeen thousand men came to its  attention, which, even over a seventy-year period, represents  a great number in a population of about forty thousand.  Moreover, careful statistical analysis of judicial  records shows that all classes of society engaged in it—  men in the textile trade, in commerce, in education, and  in the food industry, especially butchers, as well as construction  workers, tavern keepers, artists, and innkeepers.  Sodomy was not a marginal practice, which may account  for the fact that, despite harsh laws and special courts, actual  executions for sodomy were rare in Italy. They were  also uncommon in England, where despite harsh laws  there were only six trials for sodomy during the entire  long reign of Queen Elizabeth I (1564–1603). Trials  were more common in the Iberian Peninsula, where  those charged with sodomy were sometimes tortured to  reveal other names, so that sodomy accusations often occurred  in waves. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Almost all cases heard by the Florentine court and  courts in other cities involved an adult man and an adolescent  boy and ranged from sex exchanged for money or  gifts to long-term affectionate relationships. Florentines  believed in a generational model in which different roles  were appropriate to different stages in life. In a socially  and sexually hierarchical world, the boy in the passive  role was identified as subordinate, dependent, and mercenary,  words usually applied to women. Florentines,  however, never described the dominant partner in feminine  terms, for he had not compromised his masculine  identity or violated a gender ideal; in fact, the adult partner  might be married or have female sexual partners as  well as male. Only if an adult male assumed the passive  role was his masculinity jeopardized. Such cases were extremely  rare. Same-sex relations often developed within  the context of all-male environments, such as the army,  the craft shop, and the artistic workshop, and were part  of the collective male experience. Homoerotic relationships  played important roles in defining stages of life, expressing  distinctions of status, and shaping masculine  gender identity. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Same-sex relations involving women almost never  came to the attention of legal authorities, so it is difficult  to find out much about them. Most commentators about  sexual relations were male clergy who viewed sex between  women as categorically different than sex between  men, if they regarded it as sex at all. Female-female desire  is expressed in songs, plays, and stories, as is male-male  desire. Such literary sources can be used as evidence of  the way people understood same-sex relations, though  not how common such relations were. "}

The colonization of frontier regions  meant that peoples of different ethnic backgrounds lived  side by side. Everywhere in Europe, towns recruited  people from the countryside (see pages 333). In frontier  regions, townspeople were usually long-distance immigrants  and, in eastern Europe, Ireland, and Scotland,  ethnically different from the surrounding rural population.  In eastern Europe, German was the language of the "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" towns; in Irish towns, French, the tongue of Norman or  English settlers, predominated. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the early periods of conquest and colonization, and  in all regions with extensive migrations, a legal dualism  existed: native peoples remained subject to their traditional  laws; newcomers brought and were subject to the  laws of the countries from which they came. On the  Prussian and Polish frontier, for example, the law was that  “men who come there . . . should be judged on account  of any crime or contract engaged in there according to  Polish custom if they are Poles and according to German  custom if they are Germans.14 Likewise, in Spain Mudéjars,  Muslim subjects of Christian kings, received guarantees  of separate but equal judicial rights. King Alfonso I of  Aragon’s charter to the Muslims of Toledo states, “They  shall be in lawsuits and pleas under their (Muslim) qadi  (judges) . . . as it was in the times of the Moors.15 Thus  conquered peoples, whether Muslims in Spain or minority  immigrant groups such as Germans in eastern Europe,  had legal protection and lived in their own juridical enclaves.  Subject peoples experienced some disabilities, but  the broad trend was toward legal pluralism. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The great exception to this broad pattern was Ireland.  From the start, the English practiced an extreme form of  discrimination toward the native Irish. The English distinguished  between the free and the unfree, and the entire  Irish population, simply by the fact of Irish birth, was  unfree. In 1210 King John declared that “English law  and custom be established there (in Ireland). Accordingly,  a legal structure modeled on that of England, with  county courts, itinerant justices, and the common law  (see pages 271–274), was set up. But the Irish had no access  to the common-law courts. In civil (property) disputes,  an English defendant need not respond to his Irish  plaintiff; no Irish person could make a will. In criminal  procedures, the murder of an Irishman was not considered  a felony. In 1317–1318 Irish princes sent a Remonstrance  to the pope complaining that “any non-Irishman  is allowed to bring legal action against an Irishman, but  an Irishman . . . except any prelate (bishop or abbot) is  barred from every action by that fact alone. An English  defendant in the criminal matter would claim “that he is  not held to answer . . . since he [the plaintiff] is Irish and  not of free blood.16 Naturally, this emphasis on blood  descent provoked bitterness. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Other than in Ireland, although native peoples commonly  held humbler positions, both immigrant and  native townspeople prospered during the expanding  economy of the thirteenth century. When economic recession  hit during the fourteenth century, ethnic tensions  multiplied. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \f 398 CHAPTER 12 •  THE CRISIS OF THE LATER MIDDLE AGES, 1300–1450 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The later Middle Ages witnessed a movement away  from legal pluralism or dualism and toward legal homogeneity  and an emphasis on blood descent. Competition  for ecclesiastical offices and the cultural divisions between  town and country people became arenas for ethnic  tension. Since bishoprics and abbacies carried religious  authority, spiritual charisma, and often rights of appointment  to subordinate positions, they were natural objects  of ambition. When prelates of a language or “nationality  different from those of the local people gained  church positions, the latter felt a loss of influence. Bishops  were supposed to be pastors. Their pastoral work involved  preaching, teaching, and comforting, duties that  could be performed effectively only when the bishop (or  priest) could communicate with the people. Ideally, in a  pluralistic society, he should be bilingual; often he was  not. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the late thirteenth century, as waves of Germans  migrated into Danzig on the Baltic, into Silesia, and  into the Polish countryside and towns, they encountered  Jakub Swinka, archbishop of Gniezno (1283–1314),  whose jurisdiction included these areas of settlement.  The bishop hated Germans and referred to them as  “dog heads. His German contemporary, Bishop John of  Cracow, detested the Poles, wanted to expel all Polish  people, and refused to appoint Poles to any church office.  In Ireland, English colonists and the native Irish  competed for ecclesiastical offices until 1217, when the  English government in London decreed: "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Since the election of Irishmen in our land of Ireland has often  disturbed the peace of that land, we command you...  that henceforth you allow no Irishman to be elected...or  preferred in any cathedral... (and) you should seek by all  means to procure election and promotion to vacant bishoprics  of... honest Englishmen.17 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Although criticized by the pope and not totally enforceable,  this law remained in effect in many dioceses for centuries. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Likewise, the arrival of Cistercians and mendicants  (Franciscans and Dominicans) from France and Germany  in Baltic and Slavic lands provoked ethnic hostilities.  Slavic prelates and princes saw the German mendicants as  “instruments of cultural colonization, and Slavs were  strongly discouraged from becoming friars. In 1333,  when John of Drazic, bishop of Prague, founded a friary  at Roudnice (Raudnitz), he specified that “we shall admit  no one to this convent or monastery of any nation except  a Bohemian [Czech], born of two Czech-speaking parents. 18 In the fourteenth-century Dalimil Chronicle, a "}

Cobblers in fourteenth- century Beeskow, a town close to the large Slavic  population of Lausitz in Silesia, required that “an apprentice  who comes to learn his craft should be brought  before the master and guild members. ...We forbid the  sons of barbers, linen workers, shepherds, Slavs. The  bakers of the same town decreed: “Whoever wishes to be  a member must bring proof to the councillors and  guildsmen that he is born of legitimate, upright, German  folk. . . . No one of Wendish (Slavic) race may be in the  guild.20 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Ethnic purity can be maintained across generations  only by prohibiting marriage among groups, and laws  did just this. Intermarriage was forbidden in many places,  such as Riga on the Baltic (now the capital of Latvia),  where legislation for the bakers guild stipulated that  “whoever wishes to have the privilege of membership in  our company shall not take as a wife any woman who is  ill-famed . . . or non-German; if he does marry such a  woman, he must leave the company and office. Not  only the guilds but also eligibility for public office depended  on ethnic purity, as at the German burgher settlement  of Pest in Hungary, where a town judge had to  have four German grandparents. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The most extensive attempt to prevent intermarriage  and protect ethnic purity is embodied in Ireland’s  Statute of Kilkenny (1366), which states that “there  were to be no marriages between those of immigrant and  native stock; that the English inhabitants of Ireland must  employ the English language and bear English names;  that they must ride in the English way (that is, with saddles)  and have English apparel; that no Irishmen were to  be granted ecclesiastical benefices or admitted to monasteries  in the English parts of Ireland.21 Rulers of the  Christian kingdoms of Spain drew up comparable legislation  discriminating against the Mudéjars.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Late medieval chroniclers used words such as gens  (race or clan) and natio (species, stock, or kind) to refer  to different groups. They held that peoples differed according  to language, traditions, customs, and laws. None  of these were unchangeable, however, and commentators  increasingly also described ethnic differences in terms of  “blood—“German blood, “English blood, and so  on—which made ethnicity heritable.

The most dramatic  expression of this was in Spain, where “purity  of the blood—having no Muslim or Jewish  ancestors—became an obsession. Blood was  also used as a way to talk about social differences,  especially for nobles. Just as Irish and  English were prohibited from marrying each  other, those of “noble blood were prohibited  from marrying commoners in many parts  of Europe. As Europeans increasingly came  into contact with people from Africa and Asia,  and particularly as they developed colonial  empires, these notions of blood also became a  way of conceptualizing racial categories (see  page 429). "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Literacy and Vernacular  Literature "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The development of ethnic identities had  many negative consequences, but a more positive  effect was the increasing use of national  languages. In the High Middle Ages most official  documents and works of literature were  written in Latin. Beginning in the fourteenth  century, however, national languages—the  vernacular—came into widespread use not  only in verbal communication but in literature  as well. Two masterpieces of European culture,  Dante’s Divine Comedy (1310–1320)  and Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales (1387–1400),  brilliantly manifest this new national pride. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Dante Alighieri (1265–1321) descended  from a landowning family in Florence, where  he held several positions in the city government.  Dante called his work a “comedy because  he wrote it in Italian and in a different style from  the “tragic Latin; a later generation added the adjective  divine, referring both to its sacred subject and to Dante’s  artistry. The Divine Comedy is an allegorical trilogy of one  hundred cantos (verses), each of whose three equal parts  (1 + 33 + 33 + 33) describes one of the realms of the next  world: Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise. The Roman poet  Virgil, representing reason, leads Dante through Hell,  where he observes the torments of the damned and denounces  the disorders of his own time, especially ecclesiastical  ambition and corruption. Passing up into Purgatory,  Virgil shows the poet how souls are purified of their disordered  inclinations. From Purgatory, Beatrice, a woman "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" The Divine Comedy portrays contemporary and historical  figures, comments on secular and ecclesiastical affairs,  and draws on Scholastic philosophy. Within the  framework of a symbolic pilgrimage to the City of God,  the Divine Comedy embodies the psychological tensions  of the age. A profoundly Christian poem, it also contains  bitter criticism of some church authorities. In its symmetrical  structure and use of figures from the ancient  world, such as Virgil, the poem perpetuates the classical  tradition, but as the first major work of literature in the  Italian vernacular, it is distinctly modern.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Geoffrey Chaucer (1342–1400), the son of a London  wine merchant, was an official in the administrations of  the English kings Edward III and Richard II and wrote  poetry as an avocation. Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales is a  collection of stories in lengthy rhymed narrative.

In depicting the interests  and behavior of all types of people, Chaucer  presents a rich panorama of English social life in the fourteenth  century. Like the Divine Comedy, Canterbury Tales  reflects the cultural tensions of the times. Ostensibly  Christian, many of the pilgrims are also materialistic, sensual,  and worldly, suggesting the ambivalence of the  broader society’s concern for the next world and frank  enjoyment of this one.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Beginning in the fourteenth century, a variety of evidence  attests to the increasing literacy of laypeople. Wills  and inventories reveal that many people, not just nobles,  possessed books—mainly devotional, but also romances,  manuals on manners and etiquette, histories, and sometimes  legal and philosophical texts. In England the number  of schools in the diocese of York quadrupled between  1350 and 1500.

{"prompt":"","completion":" The miseries of the plague were enhanced in England  and France by the Hundred Years’ War, which was fought  intermittently in France from 1337 to 1453. The war began  as a dispute over the succession to the French crown,  and royal propaganda on both sides fostered a kind of  early nationalism. The English won most of the battles  and in 1419 advanced to the walls of Paris. The appearance  of Joan of Arc rallied the French cause, and French  troops eventually pushed English forces out of all of  France except the port of Calais. The war served as a catalyst  for the development of representative government  in England. In France, on the other hand, the war stiffened  opposition to national assemblies. "}

Women and men increasingly  relied on direct approaches to God, often  through mystical encounters, rather than on the institutional  church. Some, including John Wyclif and Jan Hus,  questioned basic church doctrines. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The plague and the war both led to higher taxes and  economic dislocations, which sparked peasant revolts in  Flanders, France, and England. Peasant revolts often  blended with conflicts involving workers in cities, where  working conditions were changing to create a greater gap  between wealthy merchant-producers and poor propertyless  workers. Unrest in the countryside and cities may  have been further exacerbated by marriage patterns that  left large numbers of young men unmarried and rootless.  The pattern of late marriage for men contributed to a  growth in prostitution, which was an accepted feature of  medieval urban society. Along with peasant revolts and  urban crime and unrest, violence perpetrated by nobles  was a common part of late medieval life. The economic  and demographic crises of the fourteenth century also  contributed to increasing ethnic tensions in the many  parts of Europe where migration had brought different  population groups together. A growing sense of ethnic  and national identity led to restrictions and occasionally  to violence, but also to the increasing use of national languages  for works of literature. The increasing number of  schools that led to the growth of lay literacy represents  another positive achievement of the later Middle Ages. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Christine de Pizan (1364?–1430; earlier  spelled “Pisan) was the daughter and wife of highly  educated men who held positions at the court of the  king of France. She was widowed at twenty-five with  young children and an elderly mother to support.  Christine, who herself had received an excellent  education, decided to support her family through  writing, an unusual choice for anyone in this era  before the printing press and unheard of for a  woman. She began to write prose works and poetry,  sending them to wealthy individuals in the hope  of receiving their support. Her works were well  received, and Christine gained commissions to write  specific works, including a biography of the French  king Charles V, several histories, a long poem  celebrating Joan of Arc’s victory, and a book of  military tactics. She became the first woman in  Europe to make her living as a writer. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Among Christine’s many works were several in  which she considered women’s nature and proper  role in society, which had been a topic of debate  since ancient times. The best known of these was  The City of Ladies (1404), in which she ponders why  so many men have a negative view of women and  provides examples of virtuous women to counter this  view. Immediately afterward she wrote The Treasure  of the City of Ladies (1405, also called The Book of  Three Virtues), which provides moral suggestions  and practical advice on behavior and household  management for women of all social classes. Most  of the book is directed toward princesses and court  ladies (who would have been able to read it), but  she also includes shorter sections for the wives of  merchants and artisans, serving-women, female  peasants, and even prostitutes. This is her advice to  the wives of artisans, whose husbands were generally  members of urban craft guilds, such as blacksmiths,  bakers, or shoemakers. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" All wives of artisans should be very painstaking  and diligent if they wish to have the necessities  of life. They should encourage their husbands  or their workmen to get to work early in the  morning and work until late, for mark our words,  there is no trade so good that if you neglect your  work you will not have difficulty putting bread on  the table. And besides encouraging the others,  the wife herself should be involved in the work  to the extent that she knows all about it, so that  she may know how to oversee his workers if her  husband is absent, and to reprove them if they do  not do well. She ought to oversee them to keep  them from idleness, for through careless workers  the master is sometimes ruined. And when  customers come to her husband and try to drive  a hard bargain, she ought to warn him solicitously  to take care that he does not make a bad deal.  She should advise him to be chary of giving too  much credit if he does not know precisely where  and to whom it is going, for in this way many  come to poverty, although sometimes the greed  to earn more or to accept a tempting proposition  makes them do it. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In addition, she ought to keep her husband’s  love as much as she can, to this end: that he will  stay at home more willingly and that he may  not have any reason to join the foolish crowds  of other young men in taverns and indulge in  unnecessary and extravagant expense, as many  tradesmen do, especially in Paris. By treating him  kindly she should protect him as well as she can  from this. It is said that three things drive a man  from his home: a quarrelsome wife, a smoking  fireplace and a leaking roof. She too ought to stay  at home gladly and not go every day traipsing  hither and yon gossiping with the neighbours  and visiting her chums to find out what everyone  is doing. That is done by slovenly housewives  roaming about the town in groups. Nor should "}

Furthermore, she ought to remind her  husband that they should live so frugally that their  expenditure does not exceed their income, so that  at the end of the year they do not find themselves  in debt. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If she has children, she should have them  instructed and taught first at school by educated  people so that they may know how better to serve  God. Afterwards they may be put to some trade  by which they may earn a living, for whoever  gives a trade or business training to her child gives  a great possession. The children should be kept  from wantonness and from voluptuousness above  all else, for truly it is something that most shames  the children of good towns and is a great sin of  mothers and fathers, who ought to be the cause  of the virtue and good behavior of their children,  but they are sometimes the reason (because of  bringing them up to be finicky and indulging  them too much) for their wickedness and ruin.

Through their works, Vasari judged, the glory of the classical past had  been reborn—or perhaps even surpassed—after centuries of darkness.  Vasari used Renaissance to describe painting, sculpture, and architecture,  what he termed the “Major Arts. Gradually, however, the word was  used to refer to many aspects of life at this time, first in Italy and then in  the rest of Europe. This new attitude had a slow diffusion out of Italy,  with the result that the Renaissance “happened at different times in different  parts of Europe: Italian art of the fourteenth through the early sixteenth  century is described as “Renaissance, and so is English literature  of the late sixteenth century, including Shakespeare’s plays and poetry.

{"prompt":"","completion":" The cultural achievements of the Renaissance rest on the  economic and political developments of earlier centuries.  Economic growth laid the material basis for the Italian  Renaissance, and ambitious merchants gained political  power to match their economic power. They then used  their money and power to buy luxuries and hire talent. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" • What economic and political developments in Italy  provided the setting for the Renaissance?  Commercial Developments "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the great commercial revival of the eleventh  century, northern Italian cities led the way. By  the middle of the twelfth century Venice, supported  by a huge merchant marine, had grown  enormously rich through overseas trade. Genoa  and Milan also enjoyed the benefits of a large  volume of trade with the Middle East and northern  Europe. These cities fully exploited their geographical  positions as natural crossroads for  mercantile exchange between the East and the  West. Furthermore, in the early fourteenth century  Genoa and Venice made important strides  in shipbuilding that for the first time allowed  their ships to sail all year long. Advances in ship  construction greatly increased the volume of  goods that could be transported; improvements  in the mechanics of sailing accelerated speed. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Scholars tend to agree that the first artistic  and literary manifestations of the Italian Renaissance  appeared in Florence, which possessed enormous  wealth despite geographical constraints: it  was an inland city without easy access to sea transportation.  But toward the end of the thirteenth  century, Florentine merchants and bankers acquired  control of papal banking. From their  position as tax collectors for the papacy, Florentine  mercantile families began to dominate  European banking on both sides of the Alps.  These families had offices in Paris, London,  Bruges, Barcelona, Marseilles, Tunis and other "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" North African ports, and, of course, Naples and Rome.  The profits from loans, investments, and money exchanges  that poured back to Florence were pumped into  urban industries. Such profits contributed to the city’s  economic vitality. Banking families, such as the Medici  in Florence, controlled the politics and culture of their  cities. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" By the first quarter of the fourteenth century, the economic  foundations of Florence were so strong that even  severe crises could not destroy the city. In 1344 King  Edward III of England repudiated his huge debts to  Florentine bankers and forced some of them into bankruptcy.  Florence suffered frightfully from the Black  Death, losing at least half its population. Serious labor  unrest, such as the ciompi revolts of 1378 (see page 392),  shook the political establishment. Nevertheless, the basic  Florentine economic structure remained stable. Driving  enterprise, technical know-how, and competitive spirit  saw Florence through the difficult economic period of  the late fourteenth century. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" \f Communes and Republics "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The northern Italian cities were communes, sworn associations  of free men seeking complete political and economic  independence from local nobles. The merchant  guilds that formed the communes built and maintained  the city walls, regulated trade, raised taxes, and kept civil  order. In the course of the twelfth century, communes at  Milan, Florence, Genoa, Siena, and Pisa fought for and  won their independence from surrounding feudal nobles.  The nobles, attracted by the opportunities of long- distance and maritime trade, the rising value of urban real  estate, the new public offices available in the expanding  communes, and the chances for advantageous marriages  into rich commercial families, frequently settled in the  cities. Marriage vows often sealed business contracts between  the rural nobility and wealthy merchants, with the  large dowries of brides providing cash for their new husbands’  businesses. This merger of the northern Italian  feudal nobility and the commercial elite created a powerful  oligarchy, or small group that ruled a city and its surrounding  countryside. The ruling oligarchy in any city  was tied together by blood, economic interests, and social  connections, but was also often divided by hostilities  of kinship groups toward one another. Such hostilities  sometimes erupted in violence, and Italian communes  were often politically unstable. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Conflict between families within the ruling oligarchy  was exacerbated by unrest coming from below. Merchant  elites made citizenship in the communes dependent on a  property qualification, years of residence within the city,  and social connections. Only a tiny percentage of the  male population possessed these qualifications and thus  could hold office in the commune’s political councils.  The common people, called the popolo, were disenfranchised  and heavily taxed, and they bitterly resented  their exclusion from power. The popolo wanted places  in the communal government and equality of taxation.  Throughout most of the thirteenth century, in city after  city, the popolo used armed force and violence to take  over the city governments. Republican governments—in  which political power theoretically resides in the people  and is exercised by their chosen representatives—were established  in Bologna, Siena, Parma, Florence, Genoa,  and other cities. The victory of the popolo proved temporary,  however, because they could not establish civil  order within their cities. Merchant oligarchies reasserted  their power and sometimes brought in powerful military  leaders to establish order. These military leaders, called  condottieri (singular, condottiero), had their own mercenary  armies, and in many cities they took over political "}

The military leader often invented a long  noble lineage to justify his takeover of power, pretending  he descended from a Germanic king or Roman leader.  There was not much that merchant oligarchies could do  to retain their power, and many cities in Italy became  signori, in which one man ruled and handed down the  right to rule to his son. Some signori (the word is plural  in Italian and is used for both persons and forms of government)  kept the institutions of communal government  in place, but these had no actual power. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For the next two centuries the Italian city-states were  ruled by signori or by merchant oligarchies. Oligarchic  regimes possessed constitutions and often boasted about  how much more democratic their form of government  was than the government in neighboring signori. In actuality,  there wasn’t much difference. In oligarchies, a  small, restricted class of wealthy merchants exercised the  judicial, executive, and legislative functions of government.  Thus, in 1422 Venice had a population of eighty- four thousand, but two hundred men held all the power;  Florence had about forty thousand people, but only six  hundred men were part of the government. Even this  number is an illusion, for real power in Florence for most  of the fifteenth century was actually held by the Medici  family. Oligarchic regimes maintained only a façade of republican  government. The Renaissance nostalgia for the  Roman form of government, combined with calculating  shrewdness, prompted the leaders of Venice, Milan, and  Florence to use the old forms. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" In the fifteenth century the signori in many cities and  the most powerful merchant oligarchs in others transformed  their households into courts. They built magnificent  palaces in the centers of cities and required  all political business be done there. They hired architects  to design and build these palaces, artists to fill them  with paintings and sculptures, and musicians and composers  to fill them with music. They supported writers  and philosophers, flaunting their patronage of learning  and the arts. They used ceremonies connected with family  births, baptisms, marriages, funerals, or triumphant  entrances into the city as occasions for magnificent  pageantry and elaborate ritual. Courtly culture afforded  signori and oligarchs the opportunity to display and assert  their wealth and power. The courts of the rulers of  Milan, Florence, and other cities were models for those  developed later by rulers of nation-states. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Balance of Power Among  the Italian City-States "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Renaissance Italians had a passionate attachment to their  individual city-states: political loyalty and feeling centered  on the local city. This intensity of local feeling perpetuated  the dozens of small states and hindered the  development of one unified state. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the fifteenth century five powers dominated the  Italian peninsula: Venice, Milan, Florence, the Papal  States, and the kingdom of Naples (see Map 13.1). The  rulers of the city-states—whether signori in Milan, patrician  elitists in Florence, or oligarchs in Venice—governed  as monarchs. They crushed urban revolts, levied taxes,  killed their enemies, and used massive building programs  to employ, and the arts to overawe, the masses. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Venice, with its enormous trade and vast colonial empire,  ranked as an international power. Though Venice  had a sophisticated constitution and was a republic in  name, an oligarchy of merchant aristocrats actually ran the  city. Milan was also called a republic, but the condottieriturned- signori of the Sforza family ruled harshly and  dominated the smaller cities of the north. Likewise, in  Florence the form of government was republican, with  authority vested in several councils of state. In reality, between  1434 and 1494, power in Florence was held by the  great Medici banking family. Though not public officers,  Cosimo (1434–1464) and Lorenzo (1469–1492) ruled  from behind the scenes. "}

"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" South of the Papal States was the kingdom of Naples,  consisting of virtually all of southern Italy and, at times,  Sicily. The kingdom of Naples had long been disputed by  the Aragonese and by the French. In 1435 it passed to  Aragon. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The major Italian city-states controlled the smaller  ones, such as Siena, Mantua, Ferrara, and Modena, and  competed furiously among themselves for territory. The  large cities used diplomacy, spies, paid informers, and any  other available means to get information that could be  used to advance their ambitions. While the states of  northern Europe were moving toward centralization and  consolidation, the world of Italian politics resembled a  jungle where the powerful dominated the weak. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In one significant respect, however, the Italian city- states anticipated future relations among competing European  states after 1500. Whenever one Italian state  appeared to gain a predominant position within the  peninsula, other states combined to establish a balance of  power against the major threat. In the formation of these  alliances, Renaissance Italians invented the machinery of  modern diplomacy: permanent embassies with resident  ambassadors in capitals where political relations and  commercial ties needed continual monitoring. The resident  ambassador was one of the great achievements of  the Italian Renaissance. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" At the end of the fifteenth century Venice, Florence,  Milan, and the papacy possessed great wealth and represented  high cultural achievement. However, their imperialistic  ambitions at one another’s expense and their  resulting inability to form a common alliance against potential  foreign enemies made Italy an inviting target for  invasion.

{"prompt":"","completion":" The Renaissance was characterized by self-conscious awareness  among fourteenth- and fifteenth-century Italians that  they were living in a new era. The realization that something  new and unique was happening first came to men  of letters in the fourteenth century, especially to the poet  and humanist Francesco Petrarch (1304–1374). Petrarch  thought that he was living at the start of a new age, a  period of light following a long night of Gothic gloom. "}

Along with many of his contemporaries, Petrarch  believed that he was witnessing a new golden age of intellectual  achievement. "}

The words humanism and  humanist derive ultimately from the Latin humanitas,  which the ancient Roman writer Cicero had used to  mean the literary culture needed by anyone who would  be considered educated and civilized. Humanists studied  the Latin classics to learn what they reveal about  human nature. Humanism emphasized human beings  and their achievements, interests, and capabilities. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Appreciation for the literary culture of the Romans  had never died in the West, but medieval writers had  studied the ancients in order to come to know God. Medieval  scholars had interpreted the classics in a Christian  sense and had invested the ancients’ poems and histories  with Christian meaning. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Renaissance humanists approached the classics differently.  Whereas medieval writers looked to the classics to  reveal God, Renaissance humanists studied the classics  to understand human nature. They viewed humanity from  a strongly Christian perspective, however: men (and  women, though to a lesser degree) were made in the image  and likeness of God. For example, in a remarkable essay,  On the Dignity of Man (1486), the Florentine writer  Giovanni Pico della Mirandola (1463–1494) stressed  that man possesses great dignity because he was made as  Adam in the image of God before the Fall and as Christ  after the Resurrection. According to Pico, man’s place in  the universe is somewhere between the beasts and the angels,  but because of the divine image planted in him,  there are no limits to what he can accomplish. Humanists  generally rejected classical ideas that were opposed to  Christianity, or they sought through reinterpretation an  underlying harmony between the pagan and secular and  the Christian faith. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Interest in human achievement led humanists to emphasize  the importance of the individual.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Education "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" One of the central preoccupations of the humanists was  education and moral behavior. Humanists poured out  treatises, often in the form of letters, on the structure and  goals of education and the training of rulers. They taught  that a life active in the world should be the aim of all educated  individuals and that education was not simply for  private or religious purposes, but benefited the public  good. In one of the earliest systematic programs for the  young, Peter Paul Vergerio (1370–1444) wrote Ubertinus,  the ruler of Carrara: "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For the education of children is a matter of more than private  interest; it concerns the State, which indeed regards the  right training of the young as, in certain aspects, within its  proper sphere.... "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" We call those studies liberal which are worthy of a free  man; those studies by which we attain and practice virtue  and wisdom; that education which calls forth, trains, and develops  those highest gifts of body and mind which ennoble  men, and which are rightly judged to rank next in dignity to  virtue only.3 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Part of Vergerio’s treatise specifies subjects for the instruction  of young men in public life: history teaches  virtue by examples from the past, ethics focuses on virtue  itself, and rhetoric or public speaking trains for eloquence. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Humanists did not simply talk about education, but  also put their ideas into practice. They opened schools  and academies in Italian cities and courts in which pupils  began with Latin grammar and rhetoric, went on to  study Roman history and political philosophy, and then  learned Greek in order to study Greek literature and philosophy.  These classics, humanists taught, would provide  models of how to write clearly, argue effectively, and  speak persuasively, important skills for future diplomats,  lawyers, military leaders, businessmen, and politicians.  Merchants and bankers sent their sons to humanist schools,  and ambitious young men from outside Italy flocked to  these schools or to schools that opened later in their own  cities. Humanist teachers and their ideas spread out  from Florence across the Alps and eventually to northern "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" European cities like London and Paris. Gradually humanist  education became the basis for intermediate and  advanced education for a large share of middle- and upper- class males. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Their emphasis on the public role and reputation of  the educated individual made humanists ambivalent in  their attitudes about education for women. If the best  models of moral behavior and clear thought were to be  found in classical authors, why should women be denied  access to these? Should the new virtues of self-confidence  and individualism be extended to include women? Most  humanists thought that a program of study that emphasized  eloquence and action was not proper for women,  for women were not to engage in public activities. They  agreed with Leonard Bruni that “rhetoric in all its forms  lies absolutely outside the province of women and that  the “field of religion and morals should be the primary  focus of women’s education.4 The Italian humanist and  polymath Leon Battista Alberti (1404–1472), discussing  morality in his On the Family, stressed that a wife’s role  should be restricted to the orderliness of the household,  food and the serving of meals, the education of children,  and the supervision of servants. (Alberti never married,  so he never put his ideas into practice in his own household.)  Humanists never established schools for girls,  though a few women of very high social status did gain a  humanist education from private tutors. The ideal Renaissance  woman looked a great deal more like her medieval  counterpart than did the Renaissance man, leading  the historian Joan Kelly to ask, in a now-famous essay,  “Did women have a Renaissance? (Her answer was no.) "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" No book on education had broader influence than Baldassare  Castiglione’s The Courtier (1528). This treatise  sought to train, discipline, and fashion the young man  into the courtly ideal, the gentleman. According to Castiglione,  who himself was a courtier serving several different  rulers, the educated man of the upper class should  have a broad background in many academic subjects, and  his spiritual and physical as well as intellectual capabilities  should be trained. The courtier should have easy familiarity  with dance, music, and the arts. Castiglione envisioned  a man who could compose a sonnet, wrestle, sing  a song and accompany himself on an instrument, ride expertly,  solve difficult mathematical problems, and, above  all, speak and write eloquently. Castiglione also included  discussion of the perfect court lady, who, like the courtier,  was to be well-educated and able to play a musical  instrument, to paint, and to dance. Physical beauty, delicacy,  affability, and modesty were also important qualities  for court ladies, however, though these were not expected  of gentlemen. "}

Asking rhetorically  whether it is better for a ruler to be loved or feared,  Machiavelli writes, “It will naturally be answered that it  would be desirable to be both the one and the other; but  as it is difficult to be both at the same time, it is much  more safe to be feared than to be loved, when you have  to choose between the two.6 "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Medieval political theory had derived ultimately from  Saint Augustine’s view that the state arose as a consequence  of Adam’s fall and people’s propensity to sin. The  test of good government was whether it provided justice,  law, and order. Political theorists and theologians from  Alcuin to Marsiglio of Padua had stressed the way government  ought to be; they had set high moral and Christian  standards for the ruler’s conduct. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Machiavelli maintained that the ruler should be concerned  not with the way things ought to be but with the  way things actually are. The sole test of a “good government  is whether it is effective, whether the ruler increases  his power. Machiavelli did not advocate amoral  behavior, but he believed that political action cannot be  restricted by moral considerations. While amoral action  might be the most effective approach in a given situation,  he did not argue for generally amoral, rather than moral,  behavior. Nevertheless, on the basis of a crude interpretation  of The Prince, the word Machiavellian entered the  language as a synonym for the politically devious, corrupt,  and crafty, indicating actions in which the end justifies  the means. The ultimate significance of Machiavelli  rests on two ideas: first, that one permanent social order  reflecting God’s will cannot be established, and second,  that politics has its own laws, based on expediency, not  morality.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Secular Spirit "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Machiavelli’s The Prince is often seen as a prime example  of another aspect of the Renaissance, secularism. Secularism  involves a basic concern with the material world  instead of with the eternal world of spirit. A secular way of  thinking tends to find the ultimate explanation of everything  and the final end of human beings within the limits  of what the senses can discover. Even though medieval  business people ruthlessly pursued profits and medieval  monks fought fiercely over property, the dominant ideals  focused on the otherworldly, on life after death. Renaissance  people often had strong and deep spiritual interests,  but in their increasingly secular society, attention was concentrated  on the here and now. Wealth allowed greater  material pleasures, a more comfortable life, and the leisure  time to appreciate and patronize the arts. The rich, social- climbing residents of Venice, Florence, Genoa, and Rome  came to see life more as an opportunity to be enjoyed  than as a painful pilgrimage to the City of God. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In On Pleasure, humanist Lorenzo Valla (1406–1457)  defends the pleasures of the senses as the highest good.  Scholars praise Valla as a father of modern historical criticism.  His study On the False Donation of Constantine  (1444) demonstrates by careful textual examination that  an anonymous eighth-century document supposedly giving  the papacy jurisdiction over vast territories in western  Europe was a forgery. Medieval people had accepted the  Donation of Constantine as a reality, and the proof that  it was an invention weakened the foundations of papal  claims to temporal authority. Lorenzo Valla’s work exemplifies  the application of critical scholarship to old and  almost sacred writings as well as the new secular spirit of  the Renaissance. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The tales in The Decameron (1350–1353) by the Florentine  Giovanni Boccaccio (1313–1375), which describe  ambitious merchants, lecherous friars, and cuckolded husbands,  portray a frankly acquisitive, sensual, and worldly  society. Although Boccaccio’s figures were stock literary  characters, The Decameron contains none of the “contempt  of the world theme so pervasive in medieval literature.  Renaissance writers justified the accumulation and  enjoyment of wealth with references to ancient authors. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Nor did church leaders do much to combat the new  secular spirit. In the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries,  the papal court and the households of the cardinals  were just as worldly as those of great urban patricians.  Of course, most of the popes and higher church officials  had come from the bourgeois aristocracy. Renaissance  popes beautified the city of Rome, patronized artists and  men of letters, and expended enormous enthusiasm and "}

Michelangelo’s dome for  Saint Peter’s is still considered his greatest work. Papal  interests, which were far removed from spiritual concerns,  fostered, rather than discouraged, the new worldly  attitude. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Despite their interest in secular matters, however, few  people (including Machiavelli) questioned the basic tenets  of the Christian religion. Italian humanists and their  aristocratic patrons were anti-ascetic, but they were not  agnostics or skeptics. The thousands of pious paintings,  sculptures, processions, and pilgrimages of the Renaissance  period prove that strong religious feeling persisted. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Christian Humanism "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The blend of religious and secular concerns of the Italian  humanists is even more pronounced among humanists  from northern Europe. In the last quarter of the fifteenth  century, students from the Low Countries, France, Germany,  and England flocked to Italy, imbibed the “new  learning, and carried it back to their countries. Northern  humanists, often called Christian humanists, interpreted  Italian ideas about and attitudes toward classical  antiquity, individualism, and humanism in terms of their  own traditions. They developed a program for broad social  reform based on Christian ideals. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Christian humanists were interested in an ethical way  of life. To achieve it, they believed that the best elements  of classical and Christian cultures should be combined.  For example, the classical ideals of calmness, stoical patience,  and broad-mindedness should be joined in human  conduct with the Christian virtues of love, faith, and  hope. Northern humanists also stressed the use of reason,  rather than acceptance of dogma, as the foundation  for an ethical way of life. Like the Italians, they were impatient  with Scholastic philosophy. Christian humanists  had profound faith in the power of human intellect to  bring about moral and institutional reform. They believed  that, although human nature had been corrupted  by sin, it was fundamentally good and capable of improvement  through education. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Utopia, which means “nowhere, describes an ideal socialistic  community on an island somewhere off the  mainland of the New World. All children receive a good  education, primarily in the Greco-Roman classics, and  learning does not cease with maturity, for the goal of all  education is to develop rational faculties. Adults divide  their days between manual labor or business pursuits and  intellectual activities. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Because profits from business and property are held in  common, there is absolute social equality. The Utopians  use gold and silver to make chamber pots and to prevent  wars by buying off their enemies. By this casual use of  precious metals, More meant to suggest that the basic  problems in society are caused by greed. Citizens of  Utopia lead an ideal, nearly perfect existence because  they live by reason; their institutions are perfect. More  punned on the word utopia, which he termed “a good  place. A good place which is no place. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" More’s ideas were profoundly original in the sixteenth  century. Contrary to the long-prevailing view that vice  and violence existed because people were basically corrupt,  More maintained that acquisitiveness and private  property promoted all sorts of vices and civil disorders.  Since society protected private property, society’s flawed  institutions were responsible for corruption and war. According  to More, the key to improvement and reform of  the individual was reform of the social institutions that  molded the individual. Today this view is so much taken  for granted that it is difficult to appreciate how radical  More’s approach was in the sixteenth century. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Erasmus’s long list of publications includes The Education  of a Christian Prince (1504), a book combining idealistic  and practical suggestions for the formation of a  ruler’s character through the careful study of Plutarch,  Aristotle, Cicero, and Plato; The Praise of Folly (1509), a  satire of worldly wisdom and a plea for the simple and  spontaneous Christian faith of children; and, most important,  a critical edition of the Greek New Testament  (1516). In the preface to the New Testament, Erasmus  explained the purpose of his great work: "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For I utterly dissent from those who are unwilling that the  sacred Scriptures should be read by the unlearned translated  into their vulgar tongue, as though Christ had taught such  subtleties that they can scarcely be understood even by a few  theologians.... Christ wished his mysteries to be published  as openly as possible. I wish that even the weakest woman  should read the Gospel—should read the epistles of Paul.  And I wish these were translated into all languages, so that  they might be read and understood, not only by Scots and  Irishmen, but also by Turks and Saracens.8 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Two fundamental themes run through all of Erasmus’s  work. First, education is the means to reform, the key to  moral and intellectual improvement. The core of education  ought to be study of the Bible and the classics. (See  the feature “Listening to the Past: An Age of Gold on  pages 442–443.) Second, the essence of Erasmus’s thought  is, in his own phrase, “the philosophy of Christ. By this  Erasmus meant that Christianity is an inner attitude of  the heart or spirit. Christianity is not formalism, special  ceremonies, or law; Christianity is Christ—his life and  what he said and did, not what theologians have written.  The Sermon on the Mount, for Erasmus, expresses the  heart of the Christian message. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Printed Word "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The fourteenth-century humanist Petrarch and the  sixteenth-century humanist Erasmus had similar ideas  about many things, but the immediate impact of their  ideas was very different because of one thing: the printing  press with movable metal type. The ideas of Petrarch  were spread the same way that ideas had been for centuries,  from person to person by hand copying. The ideas "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" of Erasmus were spread through print, in which hundreds  or thousands of identical copies could be made in a  short time. Erasmus actually spent his later years living  with printer friends, checking his own and others’ work  for errors as well as translating and writing. Print shops  were gathering places for those interested in new ideas.  Though printers were trained through apprenticeships  just like blacksmiths or butchers, they had connections to  the world of politics, art, and scholarship that other  craftsmen did not. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Printing with movable metal type developed in Germany  in the middle of the fifteenth century as a combination  of existing technologies. Several metal-smiths,  most prominently Johan Gutenberg, recognized that the  metal stamps used to mark signs on jewelry could be  covered with ink and used to mark symbols onto a surface,  in the same way that other craftsmen were using  carved wood stamps. These craftsmen carved a whole  page in wood, inked it, and pressed it on paper, and then  assembled the paper into a book called a block-book.  Block printing had been used in China and Korea since at  least the eighth century and had spread to Europe by the  thirteenth. The carvings could be used only a few dozen  times before they became ink-soaked and unreadable,  however; and since each word, phrase, or picture was on  a separate block, this method of reproduction was extraordinarily  expensive and time-consuming. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Using molds as smiths did for tableware or other metal  items, Gutenberg and his assistants made stamps—later  called type—for every letter of the alphabet and built  racks that held the type in rows. This type could be rearranged  for every page and so used over and over; it  could also be melted down and remade once it became  flattened through repeated use. They experimented with  different types of ink, settling on a type of artists’ ink,  and with different types of presses, adapting the presses  used to press grapes for wine, stamp patterns on fabric, or  make block-books. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Books were printed on paper, and by the middle of the  fifteenth century, acquiring paper was no problem. The  knowledge of paper manufacture had originated in China,  and the Arabs introduced it to the West in the twelfth  century. Europeans quickly learned that durable paper was  far less expensive than the vellum (calfskin) and parchment  (sheepskin) on which medieval scribes had relied  for centuries. By the fifteenth century the increase in urban  literacy, the development of primary schools, and the  opening of more universities had created an expanding  market for reading materials of all types (see pages 400–  401). When Gutenberg developed what he saw at first as  a faster way to copy, professional copyists writing by hand "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Gutenberg’s invention involved no special secret technology  or materials, and he was not the only one to recognize  the huge market for books. Other craftsmen  made their own type, built their own presses, and bought  their own paper, setting themselves up in business in the  cities of Germany, Switzerland, and the Netherlands, and  then in Italy, England, and France. By 1480 about 110  cities in Europe had presses, with Venice employing the  most and producing about one-eighth of all printed  books in Europe. Printing continued to spread to Spain  and Scandinavia, and by 1500, roughly fifty years after  the first printed books, more than 200 cities and towns in  Europe had presses (see Map 13.2). Historians estimate  that somewhere between 8 million and 20 million books  were printed in Europe before 1500, many more than  the number of books produced in all of Western history  up to that point.

According to Vasari, the  painter Perugino once asked why it was in Florence and  not elsewhere that men achieved perfection in the arts.  The first answer he received was, “There were so many  good critics there, for the air of the city makes men quick  and perceptive and impatient of mediocrity.9 But Florence  was not the only artistic center, for Rome and  Venice also became important, and northern Europeans  perfected their own styles.

{"prompt":"","completion":" In early Renaissance Italy, art manifested corporate power.  Powerful urban groups such as guilds or religious confraternities  commissioned works of art. The Florentine  cloth merchants, for example, delegated Filippo Brunelleschi  to build the magnificent dome on the cathedral of  Florence and selected Lorenzo Ghiberti to design the  bronze doors of the Baptistery. These works represented  the merchants’ dominant influence in the community.  Corporate patronage was also reflected in the Florentine  government’s decision to hire Michelangelo to create the "}

The  subject matter of art through the early fifteenth century,  as in the Middle Ages, remained overwhelmingly  religious. Religious themes appeared in all media—  woodcarvings, painted frescoes, stone sculptures, paintings.  As in the Middle Ages, art served an educational  purpose. A religious picture or statue was intended to  spread a particular doctrine, act as a profession of faith,  or recall sinners to a moral way of living. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Increasingly in the later fifteenth century, individuals  and oligarchs, rather than corporate groups, sponsored  works of art. Patrician merchants and bankers and popes  and princes supported the arts as a means of glorifying  themselves and their families, becoming artistic patrons.  Vast sums were spent on family chapels, frescoes, religious  panels, and tombs. Writing about 1470, Florentine  oligarch Lorenzo de’ Medici declared that his family had  spent the astronomical sum of 663,755 gold florins for  artistic and architectural commissions over the previous  thirty-five years. Yet “I think it casts a brilliant light on  our estate [public reputation] and it seems to me that the  monies were well spent and I am very pleased with  this.10 Powerful men wanted to exalt themselves, their  families, and their offices. A magnificent style of living  enriched by works of art served to prove the greatness  and the power of the despot or oligarch. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In addition to power, art reveals changing patterns of  consumption in Renaissance Italy. In the rural world of  the Middle Ages, society had been organized for war.  Men of wealth spent their money on military gear—  swords, armor, horses, crenelated castles, towers, family  compounds—all of which represent offensive or defensive  warfare. As Italian nobles settled in towns (see page  333), they adjusted to an urban culture. Rather than employing  knights for warfare, cities hired mercenaries. Expenditure  on military hardware declined. For the rich  merchant or the noble recently arrived from the countryside,  the urban palace represented the greatest outlay of  cash. It was his chief luxury, and although a private  dwelling, the palace implied grandeur. Within the palace,  the merchant-prince’s chamber, or bedroom, where he  slept and received his intimate guests, was the most important  room. In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries a  large, intricately carved wooden bed, a chest, and perhaps  a bench served as its sole decorations. The chest  held the master’s most precious goods—silver, tapestries,  jewelry, clothing. Other rooms, even in palaces of fifteen  to twenty rooms, were sparsely furnished.

{"prompt":"","completion":" The content and style of Renaissance art were often different  from those of the Middle Ages. The individual  portrait emerged as a distinct artistic genre. In the fifteenth  century members of the newly rich middle class  often had themselves painted in scenes of romantic  chivalry or courtly society. Rather than reflecting a spiritual  ideal, as medieval painting and sculpture tended to  do, Renaissance portraits showed human ideals, often  portrayed in a more realistic style. The Florentine painter  Giotto (1276–1337) led the way in the use of realism; his  treatment of the human body and face replaced the formal  stiffness and artificiality that had long characterized  representation of the human body. Piero della Francesca  (1420–1492) and Andrea Mantegna (1430\/31–1506)  seem to have pioneered perspective in painting, the linear  representation of distance and space on a flat surface. "}

Religious topics, such as the  Annunciation of the Virgin and the Nativity, remained  popular among both patrons and artists, but frequently  the patron had himself and his family portrayed.

They also symbolize the three stages of life: youth, maturity,  and old age. Here Melchior, the oldest, his large cranium symbolizing wisdom, personifies  Europe. He offers gold in a Chinese porcelain cup from the Ming Dynasty. Balthazar, with an  olive complexion and dark beard, stands for Asia and maturity.

Brunelleschi later turned his talents  to designing and constructing a dome for the Florence  Cathedral, based to some degree on Roman domes,  but higher and more graceful. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Art produced in northern Europe in the fourteenth  and fifteenth centuries tended to be more religious in  orientation than that produced in Italy. Some Flemish  painters, notably Rogier van der Weyden (1399\/1400–  1464) and Jan van Eyck (1366–1441), were considered  the artistic equals of Italian painters and were much  admired in Italy. Van Eyck, one of the earliest artists to  use oil-based paints successfully, shows the Flemish love  for detail in paintings such as Ghent Altarpiece and the  portrait Giovanni Arnolfini and His  Bride; the effect is great realism and  remarkable attention to human personality.  Northern architecture was  little influenced by the classical revival  so obvious in Renaissance Italy. "}

Raphael also oversaw a large workshop with many collaborators  and apprentices—who assisted on the less difficult  sections of some paintings—and wrote treatises on  his philosophy of art in which he emphasized the importance  of imitating nature and developing an orderly sequence  of design and proportion. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Venice became another artistic center in the sixteenth  century. Titian (1490–1576) produced portraits, religious  subjects, and mythological scenes, developing techniques  of painting in oil without doing elaborate drawings first,  which speeded up the process and pleased patrons eager  to display their acquisition. Titian and other sixteenth- century painters developed an artistic style known in  English as “mannerism (from maniera or “style in Italian)  in which artists sometimes distorted figures, exaggerated  musculature, and heightened color to express  emotion and drama more intently. (This is the style in  which Michelangelo painted the Last Judgment in the  Sistine Chapel, shown in the frontispiece to this chapter.)  Until the twentieth century, “mannerism was a negative  term; critics and art historians preferred the more naturalistic  and elegant style of Botticelli and Raphael, but  modern critics and artists have appreciated its sense of  movement, vivid colors, and passionate expressions. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Patronage and Creativity "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Artists in the Renaissance did not produce unsolicited  pictures or statues for the general public, but usually  worked on commission from patrons. A patron could be  an individual, a group such as a guild, a convent, a ruler,  or a city council. Patrons varied in their level of involvement  as a work progressed; some simply ordered a specific  subject or scene, while others oversaw the work of  the artist or architect very closely, suggesting themes and  styles and demanding changes while the work was in  progress. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The right patrons rewarded certain artists very well.  Lorenzo Ghiberti’s salary of 200 florins a year compared  favorably with that of the head of the city government,  who earned 500 florins. Moreover, at a time when a person  could live in a princely fashion on 300 ducats a year,  Leonardo da Vinci was making 2,000 ducats annually. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Aretino was not alone in addressing Michelangelo as  “divine, for the word was widely applied to him, and to  a few other artists as well. (See the feature “Individuals in  Society: Leonardo da Vinci.) Vasari described a number  of painters, sculptors, and architects, in fact, as “rare men  of genius. This adulation of the artist has led many historians  to view the Renaissance as the beginning of the  concept of the artist as genius. In the Middle Ages people  believed that only God created, albeit through individuals;  the medieval conception recognized no particular  value in artistic originality. Renaissance artists and humanists  came to think that a work of art was the deliberate  creation of a unique personality who transcended  traditions, rules, and theories. A genius had a peculiar  gift, which ordinary laws should not inhibit. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Renaissance artists were not only aware of their creative  power, but they also boasted about it. Describing  his victory over five others, including Brunelleschi, in the  competition to design the bronze doors of Florence’s  Baptistery, Ghiberti exulted, “The palm of victory was  conceded to me by all the experts and by all my fellow- competitors. By universal consent and without a single  exception the glory was conceded to me.12 Some medieval  painters and sculptors had signed their works; Renaissance  artists almost universally did so, and many of  them incorporated self-portraits, usually as bystanders, in  their paintings.

As certain artists became popular and  well-known, they could assert their own artistic styles  and pay less attention to the wishes of patrons, but even  major artists like Raphael generally worked according to  the patron’s specific guidelines. Whether in Italy or  northern Europe, most Renaissance artists trained in the  workshops of older artists; Botticelli, Raphael, Titian,  and at times even Michelangelo were known for their  large, well-run, and prolific workshops.

Caterina later married another native of Vinci.  When Ser Piero’s marriage to Donna Albrussia produced  no children, he and his wife took in Leonardo.  Ser Piero secured Leonardo’s apprenticeship with the  painter and sculptor Andrea del Verrocchio in Florence.  In 1472, when Leonardo was just twenty years  old, he was listed as a master in Florence’s  “Company of Artists. "}

His gigantic equestrian statue  in honor of Ludovico’s father, Duke Francesco Sforza,  was never made and the clay model collapsed. He  planned to write books on many subjects but never  finished any of them, leaving only notebooks.  Leonardo once said that “a painter is not admirable  unless he is universal.

{"prompt":"","completion":" • What were the key social hierarchies in Renaissance  Europe, and how did ideas about hierarchy shape  people’s lives?  Race "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Renaissance ideas about what we would term “race  were closely linked with those about ethnicity and “blood  discussed in Chapter 12 (see page 399). In law codes,  histories, and other writings, ethnic and religious groups  were referred to as gens or natio, words generally translated  as “people or “nation: the German nation, the  Irish people, the Jewish people, and so on. What exactly  made them German or Irish or Jewish was viewed as a  mixture of language, traditions, and customs, but these  were also conceptualized as “blood, and people were  described as having French blood or Jewish blood. The  word race was also used in several European languages in  the Renaissance to describe such groupings—the French  race, the Spanish race—or other social groups, such as  “the race of learned gentlemen or “the race of mankind.  It was also used to refer to family line, kindred, or  lineage. With all these words—nation, people, blood,  race—people did not clearly distinguish between things  that we would regard as biologically heritable, such as  hair color, and as socially constructed, such as being well- dressed. (The boundaries between these two are not always  clear today, of course, as arguments about certain  groups being “naturally gifted musicians or mathematicians  demonstrate.) "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The contemporary meaning of race as a system dividing  people into very large groups by skin color and other  physical characteristics originated in the eighteenth century,  when European natural scientists sought to develop  one single system that would explain human differences.  They first differentiated “races by continent of origin—  Americanus, Europaeus, Asiaticus, and Africanus—and  then by somewhat different geographical areas. The  word Caucasian was first used by the German anatomist  and naturalist Johann Friedrich Blumenbach (1752–  1840) to describe light-skinned people of Europe and  western Asia because he thought that the Caucasus  Mountains on the border between Russia and Georgia "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Social Hierarchies •  429 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" were most likely their original home. He thought that  they were the first humans, and the most attractive. (His  judgment about Caucasian attractiveness came through  studying a large collection of skulls and measuring all  other skulls against one from Georgia that he judged to  be “the most beautiful form of the skull.) This meaning  of race has had a long life, though biologists and anthropologists  today do not use it, as it has no scientific meaning  or explanatory value. Renaissance people thus did not  use race the way we do, but they did make distinctions  based on skin color. These distinctions were interwoven  with ethnic, national, and religious distinctions, and they  provide some of the background for later conceptualizations  of race. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Ever since the time of the Roman republic, a few black  Africans had lived in western Europe. They had come,  along with white slaves, as the spoils of war. Even after  the collapse of the Roman Empire, Muslim and Christian  merchants continued to import them. Unstable political  conditions in many parts of Africa enabled enterprising  merchants to seize people and sell them into slavery. Local  authorities afforded them no protection. Long tradition,  moreover, sanctioned the practice of slavery. The  evidence of medieval art attests to the continued presence  of Africans in Europe throughout the Middle Ages  and to Europeans’ awareness of them. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Beginning in the fifteenth century sizable numbers of  black slaves entered Europe. Portuguese explorers imported  perhaps a thousand a year and sold them at the  markets of Seville, Barcelona, Marseilles, and Genoa. In  the late fifteenth century this flow increased, with thousands  of people leaving the West African coast. By 1530  between four thousand and five thousand were being  sold to the Portuguese each year. By the mid-sixteenth  century blacks, slave and free, constituted about 10 percent  of the population of the Portuguese cities of Lisbon  and Évora; other cities had smaller percentages. In  all, blacks made up roughly 3 percent of the Portuguese  population. In the Iberian Peninsula, African  slaves intermingled with the people they lived among  and sometimes intermarried. Cities such as Lisbon had  significant numbers of people of mixed African and European  descent. "}

Italian aristocrats had their portraits painted  with their black pageboys to indicate their wealth (see the  illustration on page 417, in which Gozzoli’s depiction of  Cosimo de’ Medici shows him with a black groom).  Blacks were so greatly in demand at the Renaissance  courts of northern Italy, in fact, that the Venetians defied  papal threats of excommunication to secure them. In the  late fifteenth century Isabella, the wife of Gian Galazzo  Sforza, took pride in the fact that she owned ten blacks,  seven of them females. A black lady’s maid was both a  curiosity and a symbol of wealth. In 1491 Isabella of  Este, duchess of Mantua, instructed her agent to secure  a black girl between four and eight years old, “shapely  and as black as possible. The duchess saw the child as  a source of entertainment: “We shall make her very  happy and shall have great fun with her. She hoped the  girl would become “the best buffoon in the world,14 as  the cruel ancient practice of a noble household’s retaining  a professional “fool for the family’s amusement persisted  through the Renaissance—and down to the  twentieth century.

Slaves  supplemented the labor force in virtually all occupations— as agricultural laborers, as craftsmen, and as seamen  on ships going to Lisbon and Africa. Agriculture in  Europe did not involve large plantations, so large-scale  agricultural slavery did not develop there; African slaves  formed the primary workforce on the sugar plantations  set up by Europeans on the Atlantic islands in the late fifteenth  century, however (see page 505). "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Until the voyages down the African coast in the late fifteenth  century, Europeans had little concrete knowledge  of Africans and their cultures.

Thus the Devil was commonly  represented as a black man in medieval and early  Renaissance art (see the illustration on page 396). On  the other hand, blackness possessed certain positive qualities.  It symbolized the emptiness of worldly goods and  the humility of the monastic way of life. Black clothes  permitted a conservative and discreet display of wealth.  Black vestments and funeral trappings indicated grief,  and Christ had said that those who mourn are blessed.  Negative preconceptions about blackness largely outweighed  positive ones, however, and the expanding slave  trade only reinforced these. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Class "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Just as race did not develop its current meaning until  after the Renaissance, neither did class. The notion  of class—working class, middle class, upper class—was  developed by nineteenth-century social theorists, most  prominently Karl Marx. Looking at their own industrial  societies, they decided that the most basic social division  was between men who owned the “means of production,  that is, factories and equipment, and those who  did not and worked for wages. The former were the  “bourgeoisie (the middle class) and the latter the “proletariat  (the working class). (How women fit into this  division was not clear. Married women in the nineteenth  century could not own property and had no right to their  wages, which belonged to their husbands.) This was a  system of social differentiation based primarily on wealth. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" By contrast, the medieval system of social differentiation  was based on function—or least theoretical  function—in society. Medieval Europeans conceptualized  society in three basic groups: those who pray, or the  clergy; those who fight, or the nobility; and those who  work, or everyone else (see page 295). These groups  were termed “orders or “estates, and many medieval  representative assemblies, including those of France and  the Low Countries, were organized into three houses by  estate. The society of orders worked fairly well in setting  out sociolegal categories for membership in representative  bodies. It also highlighted the most important social  distinction in both medieval and Renaissance Europe,  that between noble and commoner. Status as a noble  generally brought freedom from direct taxation and  rights of jurisdiction over a piece of property and the  people who lived on it. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Social Hierarchies •  431 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" By the thirteenth century, however, and even more so  by the fifteenth, the more fixed and inherited hierarchy  of orders was interwoven with a more changeable hierarchy  based on wealth, what would later come to be  termed “social class. This was particularly true in towns.  Most residents of towns were technically members of the  “third estate, that is, not nobles or clergy, but they included  wealthy merchants who oversaw vast trading empires  and lived in splendor that rivaled the richest nobles.  As we saw above, in many cities these merchants had  gained political power to match their economic might,  becoming merchant oligarchs who ruled through city  councils. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The development of a hierarchy of wealth did not  mean an end to the hierarchy of orders, however. Those  in the first estate were far more likely to be wealthy than  those in the third, but even if they were poorer, they had  higher status. If this had not been the case, wealthy Italian  merchants would not have bothered to buy noble titles  and country villas as they began doing in the fifteenth  century, nor would wealthy English or Spanish merchants  have been eager to marry their daughters and sons  into often impoverished noble families. The nobility  maintained its status in most parts of Europe not by  maintaining rigid boundaries, but by taking in and integrating  the new social elite of wealth. Wealth allowed  some male commoners to buy or gain noble titles and female  commoners to marry into noble families. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Along with being tied to the hierarchy of orders, social  status was also linked with considerations of honor.  Among the nobility, for example, certain weapons and  battle tactics were favored because they were viewed as  more honorable. Among urban dwellers, certain occupations,  such as city executioner or manager of the municipal  brothel, might be well paid but were understood to  be “dishonorable and so of low status. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Cities were where the hierarchy of orders met the hierarchy  of wealth most dramatically. In many cities, a number  of urban merchants and bankers were wealthier than  all but the highest level of the nobility. Some of these  men climbed into the nobility through marriage, service  to a monarch, or purchase of a title. More of them  heightened social and political distinctions within cities,  trying to set themselves off as a privileged social group.  Wealthy merchants often dominated city councils, and  they made it increasingly difficult for new residents to  become citizens. They passed sumptuary laws, essentially  urban dress codes that created easily visible distinctions  between social groups (see page 338). Nobles and  wealthy urban residents could wear fine silk clothing,  jewelry, and bright colors and guild masters and artisans "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Renaissance people would have understood the word  gender to refer to categories of nouns in many European  languages, not categories of people, but they would have  easily grasped the concept. Toward the end of the fourteenth  century, learned men (and a few women) began  what was termed the “debate about women (querelle  des femmes), a debate about women’s character and nature  that would last for centuries. Misogynist critiques  of women from both clerical and secular authors denounced  females as devious, domineering, and demanding.  In answer, several authors, including Giovanni  Boccaccio and Christine de Pizan, compiled long lists of  famous and praiseworthy women exemplary for their loyalty,  bravery, and morality.

With the development of the  printing press, popular interest in the debate about  women grew, and works were translated, reprinted, and  shared around Europe. The debate about women also  found visual expression, particularly in single-sheet prints  that were hung in taverns or people’s homes.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Beginning in the sixteenth century, the debate about  women also became one about female rulers, sparked  primarily by dynastic accidents in many countries, including  Spain, England, France, and Scotland, which led to  women serving as advisers to child kings or ruling in their  own right (see pages 436 and 463). The questions vigorously  and at times viciously disputed directly concerned  the social construction of gender: could a woman’s being  born into a royal family and educated to rule allow her to  overcome the limitations of her sex? Should it? Or stated  another way: which was (or should be) the stronger determinant  of character and social role, gender or rank? There  were no successful rebellions against female rulers simply  because they were women, but in part this was because  female rulers, especially Queen Elizabeth I of England,  emphasized qualities regarded as masculine—physical  bravery, stamina, wisdom, duty—whenever they appeared  in public. Machiavelli also linked rule and masculinity, using  “effeminate to describe the worst kind of ruler. (Effeminate  in the Renaissance carried different connotations  than it does today, however; strong heterosexual passion  was not a sign of manliness, but could make one “effeminate,  that is, dominated by as well as similar to a woman.)  Male rulers also made sure that they appeared and were  portrayed on horseback with armor, weapons, and other  symbols of masculinity. The ideal Renaissance king or  courtier may have been able to sing and dance, but he was  also careful to have people see him as a warrior. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Ideas about women’s and men’s proper roles shaped  the actions of the most powerful Renaissance monarchs  and determined those of ordinary men and women even  more forcefully. The dominant notion of the “true man  was that of the married head of household, so men whose  class and age would have normally conferred political  power but who remained unmarried did not participate  on the same level as their married brothers. Unmarried  men in Venice, for example, could not be part of the ruling  council. Women were also understood as “married or  to be married, even if the actual marriage patterns in  Europe left many women (and men) unmarried until  quite late in life (see page 394). This meant that women’s  work was not viewed as supporting a family—even if it  did—and was valued less than men’s. If they worked for  wages, and many women did, women earned about half  to two-thirds of what men did even for the same work,  and they received less food (and much less ale or wine) if  wages included food. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The maintenance of appropriate power relationships  between men and women, with men dominant and  women subordinate, served as a symbol of the proper  functioning of society as a whole. Disorder in the proper  gender hierarchy was linked with other types of social upheaval  and was viewed as the most threatening way in  which the world could be turned upside down. Carnival  plays, woodcuts, and stories frequently portrayed domineering  wives in pants and henpecked husbands washing  diapers alongside professors in dunce caps and peasants  riding princes. Men and women involved in relationships  in which the women were thought to have power—an  older woman who married a younger man, or a woman  who scolded her husband—were often subjected to public  ridicule, with bands of neighbors shouting insults and  banging sticks and pans in disapproval. Of all the ways in  which Renaissance society was hierarchically arranged—  class, age, level of education, rank, race, occupation—  gender was regarded as the most “natural and therefore  the most important to defend.

First in Italy, then in  France, England, and Spain, rulers began the work of reducing  violence, curbing unruly nobles, and establishing  domestic order. They emphasized royal majesty and royal  sovereignty and insisted on the respect and loyalty of all  subjects. These monarchs ruthlessly suppressed opposition  and rebellion, especially from the nobility. They  loved the business of kingship and worked hard at it. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" The Hundred Years’ War left France drastically depopulated,  commercially ruined, and agriculturally weak. Nonetheless,  the ruler whom Joan of Arc had seen crowned at  Reims, Charles VII (r. 1422–1461), revived the monarchy  and France. He seemed an unlikely person to do so.  Frail, indecisive, and burdened with questions about his  paternity (his father had been deranged; his mother, notoriously  promiscuous), Charles VII nevertheless began  France’s long recovery. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Charles reconciled the Burgundians and Armagnacs,  who had been waging civil war for thirty years. By 1453  French armies had expelled the English from French soil  except in Calais. Charles reorganized the royal council, giving  increased influence to middle-class men, and strengthened  royal finances through such taxes as the gabelle (on  salt) and the taille (land tax). These taxes remained the  Crown’s chief sources of income until the Revolution of  1789. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" By establishing regular companies of cavalry and  archers—recruited, paid, and inspected by the state—  Charles created the first permanent royal army. In 1438  Charles published the Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges,  asserting the superiority of a general council over the papacy,  giving the French crown major control over the appointment  of bishops, and depriving the pope of French  ecclesiastical revenues. The Pragmatic Sanction established  Gallican (or French) liberties because it affirmed  the special rights of the French crown over the French  church.

He welcomed foreign  craftsmen and entered into commercial treaties with England,  Portugal, and the towns of the Hanseatic League  (see page 341). He used the revenues raised through  these economic activities and severe taxation to improve  the army. With the army, Louis stopped aristocratic brigandage  and slowly cut into urban independence.

The marriage of Louis XII (r. 1498–1515) and  Anne of Brittany added the large western duchy of Brittany  to the state. Then the French king Francis I and Pope  Leo X reached a mutually satisfactory agreement in 1516.  The new treaty, the Concordat of Bologna, rescinded the  Pragmatic Sanction’s assertion of the superiority of a general  council over the papacy and approved the pope’s  right to receive the first year’s income of new bishops and  abbots. In return, Leo X recognized the French ruler’s  right to select French bishops and abbots. French kings  thereafter effectively controlled the appointment and thus  the policies of church officials in the kingdom. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" England "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" English society suffered severely from the disorders of  the fifteenth century. The aristocracy dominated the government  of Henry IV (r. 1399–1413) and indulged in  mischievous violence at the local level. Population, decimated  by the Black Death, continued to decline. Between  1455 and 1471 adherents of the ducal houses of  York and Lancaster waged civil war, commonly called the  Wars of the Roses because the symbol of the Yorkists  was a white rose and that of the Lancastrians a red one.

{"prompt":"","completion":" (r. 1483–1485), and Henry VII (r. 1485–1509) of the  Welsh house of Tudor worked to restore royal prestige,  to crush the power of the nobility, and to establish  order and law at the local level. All three rulers used  methods that Machiavelli himself would have praised—  ruthlessness, efficiency, and secrecy.  The Hundred Years’ War had been financed by Parliament.  Dominated by baronial factions, Parliament had  been the arena in which the nobility exerted its power. As  long as the monarchy was dependent on the Lords and  the Commons for revenue, the king had to call Parliament.  Edward IV and subsequently the Tudors, excepting  Henry VIII, conducted foreign policy on the basis of  diplomacy, avoiding expensive wars. Thus the English  monarchy did not depend on Parliament for money, and  the Crown undercut that source of aristocratic influence. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Henry VII did summon several meetings of Parliament  in the early years of his reign, primarily to confirm laws,  but the center of royal authority was the royal council,  which governed at the national level. There Henry VII  revealed his distrust of the nobility: though not completely  excluded, very few great lords were among the  king’s closest advisers. Regular representatives on the  council numbered between twelve and fifteen men, and  while many gained high ecclesiastical rank (the means, as  it happened, by which the Crown paid them), their origins  were in the lesser landowning class, and their education  was in law. They were, in a sense, middle class. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The royal council handled any business the king put  before it—executive, legislative, and judicial. For example,  the council conducted negotiations with foreign  governments and secured international recognition of  the Tudor dynasty through the marriage in 1501 of  Henry VII’s eldest son Arthur to Catherine of Aragon,  the daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain. The  council dealt with real or potential aristocratic threats  through a judicial offshoot, the court of Star Chamber,  so called because of the stars painted on the ceiling of the  room. The court applied principles of Roman law, and  its methods were sometimes terrifying: accused persons  were not entitled to see evidence against them; sessions  were secret; torture could be applied to extract confessions;  and juries were not called. These procedures ran  directly counter to English common-law precedents, but  they effectively reduced aristocratic troublemaking. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" The Tudors won the support of the influential upper  middle class because the Crown linked government policy  with the interests of that class. A commercial or agricultural  upper class fears and dislikes few things more than  disorder and violence. The Tudors promoted peace and  social order, and the gentry did not object to arbitrary  methods, like those of the court of Star Chamber, because  the government had halted the long period of anarchy. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Secretive, cautious, and thrifty, Henry VII rebuilt the  monarchy. He encouraged the cloth industry and built  up the English merchant marine. English exports of wool  and the royal export tax on that wool steadily increased.  Henry crushed an invasion from Ireland and secured  peace with Scotland through the marriage of his daughter  Margaret to the Scottish king. When Henry VII died  in 1509, he left a country at peace both domestically and  internationally, a substantially augmented treasury, and  the dignity and role of the royal majesty much enhanced. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Spain "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" While England and France laid the foundations of unified  nation-states during the Renaissance, Spain remained a  conglomerate of independent kingdoms. Castile and  León formed a single political organization, but Aragon  consisted of the principalities of Aragon, Valencia, Majorca,  Sicily, Cardeña, and Naples, each tied to the crown  of Aragon in a different way. On the one hand, the legacy  of Hispanic, Roman, Visigothic, Jewish, and Muslim  peoples made for rich cultural diversity; on the other  hand, the Iberian Peninsula lacked a common cultural  tradition. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The centuries-long reconquista—the wars of the northern  Christian kingdoms to control the entire peninsula  (see pages 265–267)—had military and religious objectives:  conversion or expulsion of the Muslims and Jews  and political control of the south. By the middle of the  fifteenth century, the kingdoms of Castile and Aragon  dominated the weaker Navarre, Portugal, and Granada,  and the Iberian Peninsula, with the exception of Granada,  had been won for Christianity. But even the wedding  in 1469 of the dynamic and aggressive Isabella of  Castile and the crafty and persistent Ferdinand of Aragon  did not bring about administrative unity. Rather, their  marriage constituted a dynastic union of two royal  houses, not the political union of two peoples. Although  Ferdinand and Isabella (r. 1474–1516) pursued a com"}

{"prompt":"","completion":" To curb the rebellious and warring aristocracy, Ferdinand  and Isabella revived an old medieval institution: the  hermandades, or “brotherhoods, which were popular  groups in the towns given authority to act as local police  forces and judicial tribunals. The hermandades repressed  violence with such savage punishments that by 1498 they  could be disbanded. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The decisive step Ferdinand and Isabella took to curb  aristocratic power was the restructuring of the royal  council. Aristocrats and great territorial magnates were  rigorously excluded; thus the influence of the nobility on  state policy was greatly reduced. Ferdinand and Isabella  intended the council to be the cornerstone of their government  system, with full executive, judicial, and legislative  powers under the monarchy. The council was also to  be responsible for the supervision of local authorities.  The king and queen therefore appointed only people of  middle-class background to the council. The council and  various government boards recruited men trained in Roman  law, which exalted the power of the Crown as the  embodiment of the state. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the extension of royal authority and the consolidation  of the territories of Spain, the church was the  linchpin. If the Spanish crown could select the higher  clergy, the monarchy could influence ecclesiastical policy,  wealth, and military resources. Through a diplomatic alliance  with the Spanish pope Alexander VI, the Spanish  monarchs secured the right to appoint bishops in Spain  and in the Hispanic territories in America. This power  enabled the “Catholic Kings of Spain, a title granted  Ferdinand and Isabella by the papacy, to establish, in effect,  a national church. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Revenues from ecclesiastical estates provided the means  to raise an army to continue the reconquista. The victorious  entry of Ferdinand and Isabella into Granada on  January 6, 1492, signaled the culmination of eight centuries  of Spanish struggle against the Arabs in southern  Spain and the conclusion of the reconquista (see Map 9.3  on page 266).

{"prompt":"","completion":" Recent scholarship has carefully analyzed documents  of the Inquisition. Most conversos identified themselves  as Christians.

{"prompt":"","completion":" In response, officials of the Inquisition developed a  new type of anti-Semitism. A person’s status as a Jew,  they argued, could not be changed by religious conversion,  but was in the person’s nature as a human being.

In what were known as  “purity of the blood laws, having pure Christian blood  became a requirement for noble status. Intermarriage between  Old and New Christians had been common for "}

Jews,  therefore, represented a grave threat to national unity. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Although the Inquisition was a religious institution established  to ensure the Catholic faith, it was controlled  by the Crown and served primarily as a politically unifying  tool. Because the Spanish Inquisition commonly applied  torture to extract confessions, first from conversos,  then from Muslims, and later from Protestants, it gained  a notorious reputation. Thus the word inquisition, meaning  “any judicial inquiry conducted with ruthless severity,  came into the English language. The methods of the  Spanish Inquisition were cruel, though not as cruel as the  investigative methods of some twentieth-century governments. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" The Italian Renaissance rested on the phenomenal economic  growth of the High Middle Ages. In the period  from about 1050 to 1300, a new economy emerged  based on Venetian and Genoese shipping and long- distance trade and on Florentine banking and cloth manufacture.  These commercial activities, combined with the  struggle of urban communes for political independence  from surrounding feudal lords, led to the appearance of a  new ruling group in Italian cities—merchant oligarchs.  Unrest in some cities led to their being taken over by single  rulers, but however Italian cities were governed, they  jockeyed for power with one another and prevented the  establishment of a single Italian nation-state.

{"prompt":"","completion":" The Renaissance was characterized by self-conscious  awareness among fourteenth- and fifteenth-century Italians,  particularly scholars and writers known as humanists,  that they were living in a new era. Key to this  attitude was a serious interest in the Latin classics, a belief  in individual potential, and a more secular attitude  toward life. All these are evident in political theory developed  in the Renaissance, particularly that of Machiavelli.  Humanists opened schools for boys and young men to  train them for an active life of public service, but they had  doubts about whether humanist education was appropriate  for women. As humanism spread to northern Europe,  religious concerns became more pronounced, and Christian  humanists set out plans for the reform of church and  society. Their ideas were spread to a much wider audience  than those of early humanists because of the development  of the printing press with movable metal type,  which revolutionized communication. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Interest in the classical past and in the individual also  shaped Renaissance art in terms of style and subject matter.  Painting became more naturalistic, and the individual  portrait emerged as a distinct artistic genre. Wealthy merchants,  cultured rulers, and powerful popes all hired  painters, sculptors, and architects to design and ornament  public and private buildings. Art in Italy became  more secular and classical, while that in northern Europe  retained a more religious tone. Artists began to understand  themselves as having a special creative genius,  though they continued to produce works on order for  patrons, who often determined the content and form. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Social hierarchies in the Renaissance built on those of  the Middle Ages, but also developed new features that  contributed to the modern social hierarchies of race,  class, and gender. Black Africans entered Europe in sizable  numbers for the first time since the collapse of the  Roman Empire, and Europeans fit them into changing  understandings of ethnicity and race. The medieval hierarchy  of orders based on function in society intermingled  with a new hierarchy based on wealth, with new types of  elites becoming more powerful. The Renaissance debate  about women led many to discuss women’s nature and  proper role in society, a discussion sharpened by the presence  of a number of ruling queens in this era. "}

Wolfgang Capito (1478?–  1541), a German scholar, was professor of theology  at the University of Basel. Pope Leo X (1513–1521),  second son of Lorenzo de’ Medici, extended the  hospitality of the papal court to men of letters,  sought to rebuild Rome as a Renaissance capital,  and pushed the building of the new Saint Peter’s  Basilica by licensing the sale of indulgences (see  page 448).

{"prompt":"","completion":" \f Reformations and  Religious Wars,  1500–160014Calls for reform of the Christian church began very early in its his- tory. When Christianity became the official religion of the Roman  Empire in the fourth century, many believers thought that the church had  abandoned its original mission, and they called for a return to a church  that was not linked to the state.

The Christian humanists of the late fifteenth and early sixteenth  centuries urged reform, primarily through educational and social change. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Sixteenth-century cries for reformation were hardly new. Throughout  the centuries, men and women believed that the early Christian church  represented a golden age, akin to the golden age of the classical past celebrated  by Renaissance humanists. What was new was the breadth of acceptance  and the ultimate impact of the calls for reform. In 1500 there  was one Christian church in western Europe to which all Christians at  least nominally belonged. Fifty years later there were many, a situation  that continues today. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Along with the Renaissance, the Reformation is often seen as a key  element in the creation of the “modern world. This radical change contained  many elements of continuity, however. Sixteenth-century reformers  looked back to the early Christian church for their inspiration, and  many of their reforming ideas had been advocated for centuries. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Calls for reform in the church came from many quarters in early- sixteenth-century Europe—from educated laypeople such as Christian  humanists and urban residents, from villagers and artisans, and from  church officials themselves.

{"prompt":"","completion":" If external religious observances are a measure of depth  of heartfelt conviction, Europeans in the early sixteenth  century were deeply pious and remained loyal to the Roman  Catholic Church. Villagers participated in processions  honoring the local saints. Middle-class people made  pilgrimages to the great shrines, such as Saint Peter’s in  Rome. The upper classes continued to remember the  church in their wills. People of all social classes devoted  an enormous amount of their time and income to religious  causes and foundations. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Despite—or perhaps because of—the depth of their  piety, many people were also highly critical of the Roman  Catholic Church and its clergy. The papal conflict with  the German emperor Frederick II in the thirteenth century,  followed by the Babylonian Captivity and then the  Great Schism, badly damaged the prestige of church  leaders. Humanists denounced corruption in the church.  In The Praise of Folly, Erasmus condemned the superstitions  of the parish clergy and the excessive rituals of the  monks (see page 325). Many ordinary people agreed.  Court records, bishop’s visitations of parishes, and even  popular songs and printed images show widespread anti- clericalism, or opposition to the clergy. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Primary Source: The Praise of Folly: Erasmus on Popular  Religious Practice "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the early sixteenth century critics of the church concentrated  their attacks on three disorders—clerical immorality,  clerical ignorance, and clerical pluralism, with  the related problem of absenteeism. Many priests, particularly  those ministering to country people, had concubines,  and reports of neglect of the rule of celibacy were  common. Clerical drunkenness, gambling, and indulgence  in fancy dress were also frequent charges. Because "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" such conduct was completely at odds with the church’s  rules and moral standards, it scandalized the educated  faithful. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The bishops only casually enforced regulations regarding  the education of priests. As a result, standards for ordination  were shockingly low. Many priests could barely  read and write, and critics laughed at illiterate priests  mumbling Latin words of the Mass that they could not  understand. In northern Europe—in England, for example— recent research shows an improvement in clerical  educational standards in the early sixteenth century. Nevertheless,  parish priests throughout Europe were not as  educated as the educated laity, who condemned the irregularity  and poor quality of sermons. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In regard to absenteeism and pluralism, many clerics,  especially higher ecclesiastics, held several benefices (or  offices) simultaneously but seldom visited the benefices,  let alone performed the spiritual responsibilities those offices  entailed. Instead, they collected revenues from all of  them and hired a poor priest, paying him just a fraction  of the income to fulfill the spiritual duties of a particular  local church. Many Italian officials in the papal curia held  benefices in England, Spain, and Germany. Revenues  from those countries paid the Italian priests’ salaries, provoking  not only charges of absenteeism but also nationalistic  resentment. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There was also local resentment of clerical privileges  and immunities. Priests, monks, and nuns were exempt  from civic responsibilities, such as defending the city and  paying taxes. Yet religious orders frequently held large  amounts of urban property, in some cities as much as  one-third. City governments were increasingly determined  to integrate the clergy into civic life by reducing  their privileges and giving them public responsibilities.  This brought city leaders into opposition with bishops  and the papacy, which for centuries had stressed the independence  of the church from lay control and the distinction  between members of the clergy and laypeople. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Martin Luther "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" By itself, widespread criticism of the church did not lead  to the dramatic changes of the sixteenth century. Those  resulted from the personal religious struggle of a German  university professor, Martin Luther (1483–1546), who  was also an Augustinian friar. The Augustinian friars were  a mendicant order, like the Dominicans and Franciscans,  whose members often preached, taught, and assisted the  poor. Martin Luther was born at Eisleben in Saxony and  was the second son of a copper miner and, later, mine  owner. At considerable sacrifice, his father sent him to "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \f school and then to the University of Erfurt, where he  earned a master’s degree with distinction at the young  age of twenty-one. Hans Luther intended his son to proceed  to the study of law and a legal career, which for centuries  had been the steppingstone to public office and  material success. Badly frightened during a thunderstorm,  however, Martin Luther vowed to become a friar.  Much to his father’s dismay, he entered the monastery of  the Augustinian friars at Erfurt in 1505. Luther was ordained  a priest in 1507 and after additional study earned  a doctorate of theology. From 1512 until his death in  1546, he served as professor of the Scriptures at the new  University of Wittenberg. Luther was deadly serious  when he said, years later, “I would not take all the  world’s goods for my doctorate. His doctorate led to  his professorship, and his professorship conferred on him  the authority to teach: throughout his life, he frequently  cited his professorship as justification for his reforming  work. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Martin Luther was a very conscientious friar. His  scrupulous observance of the religious routine, frequent  confessions, and fasting, however, gave him only temporary  relief from anxieties about sin and his ability to meet  God’s demands. These apprehensions in turn led him to  doubt the value of the monastic life itself. Since the medieval  church had long held that the monastic life was a  sure and certain road to salvation, Luther’s confusion  and anxieties increased. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Luther’s wise and kindly confessor, John Staupitz, directed  him to study Saint Paul’s letters in the New Testament.  Gradually Luther arrived at a new understanding  of the Pauline letters and of all Christian doctrine. His  understanding is often summarized as “faith alone, grace  alone, Scripture alone (sola fide, sola gratia, sola Scriptura).  For Christians, salvation and justification come  through faith, not good works, though true faith leads to  love and to the active expression of faith in helping others.  Faith is a free gift of God, not the result of human effort.  God’s word is revealed only in Scripture, not in the  traditions of the church. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" At the same time Luther was engaged in scholarly reflections  and professorial lecturing, Archbishop Albert of  Mainz, who controlled the area in which Wittenberg was  located, sought to become the bishop of several other  territories as well. He borrowed money from the Fuggers,  a wealthy banking family of Augsburg, to pay for  the papal dispensation of the rules regarding pluralism.  Meanwhile, Pope Leo X, a member of the Medici family,  was constructing family chapels and tombs (for which he  hired Michelangelo) and continuing the building of St.  Peter’s Basilica in Rome.

With one claw in holy water, another resting on the  coins paid for indulgences, and a third stretched out for offerings,  the church, in the form of a rapacious bird, writes out an  indulgence with excrement. The creature’s head and gaping  mouth represent Hell, with foolish Christians inside, others  being cooked in a pot above, and a demon delivering the pope  in a three-tiered crown and holding the keys to Heaven, a  symbol of papal authority. Illustrations such as this, often  printed as single-sheet broadsides and sold very cheaply,  clearly conveyed criticism of the church to people who could  not read.

{"prompt":"","completion":" What exactly was an indulgence? According to Catholic  theology, individuals who sin alienate themselves  from God. To be reconciled to God, the sinner must  confess his or her sins to a priest and do an assigned  penance, a religious act such as praying or fasting. Sometimes  earthly penance is not enough, and beginning in  the twelfth century learned theologians increasingly emphasized  the idea of purgatory, a place where souls on  their way to Heaven after death went to make amends for  their earthly sins. (Those on their way to Hell went "}

When it was first discussed, purgatory was  a rather neutral place, unpleasant largely because one was  separated from God, but by the fifteenth century it had  acquired the fire and brimstone of Hell. Time in purgatory  could be shortened by actions of the living, however,  such as arranging for memorial masses or saying  prayers for the dead. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" According to Catholic theology, the church has the authority  to grant sinners the remission of the penalties for  sin by drawing on what was termed the “treasury of merits.  This was a collection of all the virtuous acts that  Christ, the apostles, and the saints had done during their  lives; their virtue was infinite, and so was the treasury of  merit. People thought of it as a sort of strongbox, like  those in which merchants carried coins. An indulgence  was a piece of parchment (and later paper), signed by the  pope or another church official, that substituted a virtuous  act from the treasury of merit for penance. The papacy  and bishops had given Crusaders such indulgences,  and by the later Middle Ages they were offered for making  pilgrimages or other pious activities and also sold  outright. People widely believed that indulgences secured  total remission of penalties for sin and could substitute  for both penance and time in purgatory. They  ensured swift entry into Heaven and, like prayers for the  dead, were effective on behalf of relatives or friends already  dead. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Luther was severely troubled that ignorant people believed  that they had no further need for repentance once  they had purchased indulgences. He wrote a letter to  Archbishop Albert on the subject and enclosed in Latin  “Ninety-five Theses on the Power of Indulgences. His  argument was that indulgences undermined the seriousness  of the sacrament of penance, competed with the  preaching of the Gospel, and downplayed the importance  of charity in Christian life. After Luther’s death, biographies  reported that the theses were also posted on  the door of the church at Wittenberg Castle on October  31, 1517. Such an act would have been very strange—  they were in Latin and written for those learned in theology,  not for normal churchgoers—but it has become a  standard part of Luther lore. In any case, Luther intended  the theses for academic debate, but by December  1517 they had been translated into German and were  read throughout the Roman Empire. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" The papacy responded with a letter condemning some  of Luther’s propositions, ordering that his books be  burned, and giving him two months to recant or be excommunicated.  Luther retaliated by publicly burning  the letter. By January 3, 1521, when the excommunication  was supposed to become final, the controversy involved  more than theological issues. The papal legate  wrote, “All Germany is in revolution. Nine-tenths shout  ‘Luther’ as their war cry; and the other tenth cares nothing  about Luther, and cries ‘Death to the court of  Rome.’1 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In this highly charged atmosphere, the twenty-oneyear- old emperor Charles V held his first diet (assembly  of the Estates of the empire) in the German city of  Worms. Charles summoned Luther to appear before the  Diet of Worms. When ordered to recant, Luther replied  in language that rang all over Europe: "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Unless I am convinced by the evidence of Scripture or by  plain reason—for I do not accept the authority of the Pope  or the councils alone, since it is established that they have  often erred and contradicted themselves—I am bound by  the Scriptures I have cited and my conscience is captive to  the Word of God. I cannot and will not recant anything, for it  is neither safe nor right to go against conscience. God help  me. Amen.2 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Protestant Thought "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As he developed his ideas, Luther gathered followers,  who came to be called Protestants. The word Protestant  derives from the protest drawn up by a small group of reforming  German princes at the Diet of Speyer in 1529.  The princes “protested the decisions of the Catholic  majority. At first Protestant meant “Lutheran, but with  the appearance of many protesting sects, it became a general  term applied to all non-Catholic western European  Christians. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The most important early reformer other than Luther  was the Swiss humanist, priest, and admirer of Erasmus,  Ulrich Zwingli (1484–1531). In Zurich, Zwingli announced  in 1519 that he would preach not from the  church’s prescribed readings but, relying on Erasmus’s  New Testament, go right through the New Testament  “from A to Z, that is, from Matthew to Revelation. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Early Reformation • 449 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Zwingli was convinced that Christian life rested on the  Scriptures, which were the pure words of God and the  sole basis of religious truth. He went on to attack indulgences,  the Mass, the institution of monasticism, and  clerical celibacy. In his gradual reform of the church in  Zurich, where he remained the rest of his life, he had the  strong support of the city authorities, who had long resented  the privileges of the clergy. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Luther, Zwingli, and other Protestants agreed on  many things. First, how is a person to be saved? Traditional  Catholic teaching held that salvation is achieved by  both faith and good works. Protestants held that salvation  comes by faith alone. Women and men are saved by  the arbitrary decision of God, irrespective of good works  or the sacraments. God, not people, initiates salvation.  (See the feature “Listening to the Past: Martin Luther,  On Christian Liberty on pages 480–481.) Second, where  does religious authority reside? Christian doctrine had  long maintained that authority rests both in the Bible  and in the traditional teaching of the church. For Protestants,  authority rests in the Word of God as revealed in  the Bible alone and as interpreted by an individual’s conscience.  For a doctrine or issue to be valid, it had to have  a scriptural basis. Because of this, most Protestants rejected  Catholic teachings about the sacraments (see page  308), holding that only baptism and the Eucharist have  scriptural support. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Third, what is the church? Protestants held that the  church is a spiritual priesthood of all believers, an invisible  fellowship not fixed in any place or person, which differed  markedly from the Roman Catholic practice of a  clerical, hierarchical institution headed by the pope in  Rome. Luther re-emphasized the Catholic teaching that  the church consists of the entire community of Christian  believers. Medieval churchmen, in contrast, had tended  to identify the church with the clergy. Fourth, what is the  highest form of Christian life? The medieval church had  stressed the superiority of the monastic and religious life  over the secular. Luther argued that all vocations, whether  ecclesiastical or secular, have equal merit and that  every person should serve God in his or her individual  calling. Celibacy was not superior to marriage, and vows  of celibacy went against both human nature and God’s  commandment. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Protestants did not agree on everything. One important  area of dispute was the ritual of the Eucharist (also  called communion, or the Lord’s Supper). Catholics  hold the dogma of transubstantiation: by the consecrating  words of the priest during the Mass, the bread and  wine become the actual body and blood of Christ, who is  then fully present in the bread and wine.

Cranach became an early supporter of Luther, and many of his later  works depict the reformer and his ideas. This close association, and the fact that the painting captures  the Protestant emphasis on biblical texts very well, led it to be moved to the Luther House in Wittenberg,  the largest museum of the Protestant Reformation in the world. Paintings were used by both  Protestants and Catholics to teach religious ideas. (Lutherhalle, Wittenberg\/The Bridgeman Art Library) "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Luther believed that Christ is really present in the consecrated  bread and wine, but this is the result of God’s  mystery, not the actions of a priest. Zwingli understood  the Lord’s Supper as a memorial, in which Christ was  present in spirit among the faithful, but not in the bread  and wine. The Colloquy of Marburg, summoned in 1529  to unite Protestants, failed to resolve these differences,  though Protestants reached agreement on almost everything  else. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Appeal of Protestant Ideas "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Every encounter Luther had with ecclesiastical or political  authorities attracted attention. Pulpits and printing  presses spread his message all over Germany. By the time  of his death, people of all social classes had become  Lutheran. What was the immense appeal of Luther’s religious  ideas and those of other Protestants? "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Educated people and humanists were much attracted  by Luther’s words. He advocated a simpler personal religion  based on faith, a return to the spirit of the early "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" church, the centrality of the Scriptures in the liturgy and  in Christian life, and the abolition of elaborate ceremonies— precisely the reforms the Christian humanists  had been calling for. His insistence that everyone should  read and reflect on the Scriptures attracted the literate  and thoughtful middle classes partly because Luther appealed  to their intelligence. This included many priests  and monks, who became clergy in the new Protestant  churches. There was no official position for women in  Protestant churches, but Protestant literature was smuggled  into convents. Some nuns (most famously Katharina  von Bora, who became Luther’s wife) accepted Luther’s  idea that celibacy was not especially worthy and left their  convents, while others remained in their convents but  otherwise accepted Protestant teachings. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As we saw above, many townspeople envied the  church’s wealth, disapproved of the luxurious lifestyle of  some churchmen, and resented tithes and ecclesiastical  taxation.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Hymns, psalms, and Luther’s two catechisms (1529),  compendiums of basic religious knowledge, show the  power of language in spreading the ideals of the Reformation.  Such hymns as the famous “A Mighty Fortress Is  Our God (which Luther wrote) expressed deep human  feelings, were easily remembered, and imprinted central  points of doctrine on the mind. Luther’s Larger Catechism  contained brief sermons on the main articles of  faith, whereas the Shorter Catechism gave concise explanations  of doctrine in question-and-answer form. Both  catechisms stressed the importance of the Ten Commandments,  the Lord’s Prayer, the Apostle’s Creed, and  the sacraments for the believing Christian. Although  originally intended for the instruction of pastors, these  catechisms became powerful techniques for the indoctrination  of men and women of all ages, especially the  young. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Scholars in many disciplines have attributed Luther’s  fame and success to the invention of the printing press,  which rapidly reproduced and made known his ideas.  Many printed works included woodcuts and other illustrations,  so that even those who could not read could  grasp the main ideas. (See the feature “Images in Society:  Art in the Reformation on pages 452–453.) Equally important  was Luther’s incredible skill with language.  Luther’s linguistic skill, together with his translation of  the New Testament into German in 1523, led to the acceptance  of his dialect of German as the standard version  of German. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Both Luther and Zwingli recognized that if reforms  were going to be permanent, political authorities as well  as concerned individuals and religious leaders would have  to accept them. Zwingli worked closely with the city  council of Zurich, and in other cities and towns of  Switzerland and south Germany city councils similarly  took the lead. They appointed pastors that they knew  had accepted Protestant ideas, required them to swear an  oath of loyalty to the council, and oversaw their preaching  and teaching. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Luther lived in a territory ruled by a noble—the elector  of Saxony—and he also worked closely with political  authorities, viewing them as fully justified in asserting  control over the church in their territories. Indeed, in his  1520 Address to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation  he demanded that German rulers reform the papacy  and ecclesiastical institutions, and in On Secular Government  he instructed all Christians to obey their secular  rulers, whom he saw as divinely ordained to maintain or-"}

{"prompt":"","completion":" der. In terms of the process of the Reformation, Luther’s  hopes were largely fulfilled. Individuals may have been  convinced of the truth of Protestant teachings by hearing  sermons, listening to hymns, or reading pamphlets,  but a territory became Protestant when its ruler,  whether a noble or a city council, brought in a reformer  or to re-educate the territory’s clergy, sponsored public  sermons, and confiscated church property. This happened  in many of the states of the empire during the 1520s. In  every area that became Protestant, there was aslightly  differ-ent balance between popular religious ideas and  the aims of the political authorities. In some areas certain  groups, such as clergy or journeymen, pushed for reforms,  while in others the ruler or city council forced religious  change on a population that was disinterested or  hostile. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The first area outside the empire to officially accept the  Reformation was the kingdom of Denmark-Norway under  King Christian III (r. 1536–1559). Danish scholars  studied at the University of Wittenberg, and Lutheran  ideas spread into Denmark very quickly. In the 1530s the  king officially broke with the Catholic Church, and most  clergy followed. The process went smoothly in Denmark,  but in northern Norway and Iceland (which Christian  also ruled) there were violent reactions, and Lutheranism  was only gradually imposed on a largely unwilling  populace. In Sweden, Gustavus Vasa (r. 1523–1560), who  came to the throne during a civil war with Denmark, also  took over control of church personnel and income, and  Protestant ideas spread, though the Swedish church did  not officially accept Lutheran theology until later in the  century.

{"prompt":"","completion":" The Radical Reformation "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Some individuals and groups rejected the idea that  church and state needed to be united, and sought to create  a voluntary community of believers as they understood  it to have existed in New Testament times. In  terms of theology and spiritual practices, these individuals  and groups varied widely, though they are generally  termed “radicals for their insistence on a more extensive  break with the past. Many of them repudiated infant baptism,  for they wanted only members who had intentionally  chosen to belong. Some adopted the baptism of  believers—for which they were given the title of “Anabaptists  or rebaptizers by their enemies—while others  saw all outward sacraments or rituals as misguided and  concentrated on inner spiritual transformation. Some  groups attempted to follow Christ’s commandments in  the Gospels literally, while others reinterpreted the nature "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \f Images in Society  Art in the Reformation "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the Reformation era, controversy raged over the  purpose and function of art. Protestants and Catholics  disagreed, and Protestant groups disagreed with one  another. The Bible specifically prohibits making images  of anything “in the heavens above or the earth below  or the waters beneath the earth (Exodus 20:4–6 and  Deuteronomy 5:8–10). Based on this, some Protestant  leaders, including Ulrich Zwingli, stressed that “the  Word of God should be the only instrument used in  the work of evangelization. Martin Luther disagreed,  saying he was not “of the opinion that the Gospel  should blight and destroy all the arts. Luther believed  that painting and sculpture had value in spreading the  Gospel message because “children and simple folk are  more apt to retain the divine stories when taught by  pictures and parables than merely by words or instruction.  Similar debates involved music, with Luther  supporting and even writing hymns, and Swiss Protestants  removing organs from their churches. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Lucas Cranach the Elder (1472–1553), a close  friend of Luther’s, is the finest representative of  Protestant Reformation artists. He and Luther collaborated  on the production of woodcuts and paintings,  such as The Ten Commandments (see page  450), that spread the new evangelical  theology.

In later life, Calvin tolerated narrative biblical  scenes as long as they did not include pictures of  God or Jesus Christ. In the Netherlands, which  adopted a Calvinist version of Protestantism, many  formerly Catholic churches were stripped of all statues,  images, and decoration and were redesigned with a  stark, bare simplicity that mirrored the Calvinist ideal.

{"prompt":"","completion":" \f The Early Reformation • 455 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Peasant revolts had erupted in many parts of Europe in  the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries (see page 390). In  the early sixteenth century the economic condition of the  peasantry varied from place to place but was generally  worse than it had been in the fifteenth century and was  deteriorating. Crop failures in 1523 and 1524 aggravated  an explosive situation. In 1525 representatives of  the Swabian peasants met at the city of Memmingen and  drew up the Twelve Articles expressing their grievances.  The Twelve Articles condemned lay and ecclesiastical  lords and summarized the agrarian crisis of the early sixteenth  century. They complained that nobles had seized  village common lands, which traditionally had been used  by all; that they had imposed new rents on manorial  properties and new services on the peasants working  those properties; and that they had forced the poor to  pay unjust death duties in the form of the peasants’ best  horses or cows. Wealthy, socially mobile peasants especially  resented these burdens, which they emphasized as  new. The peasants believed that their demands conformed  to the Scriptures and cited Luther as a theologian  who could prove that they did. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Luther wanted to prevent rebellion. Initially he sided  with the peasants, and he blasted the lords in his tract An  Admonition to Peace (1525): "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" We have no one on earth to thank for this mischievous rebellion,  except you lords and princes, especially you blind bishops  and mad priests and monks....In your government you  do nothing but flay and rob your subjects in order that you  may lead a life of splendor and pride, until the poor common  folk can bear it no longer.3 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But, he warned, nothing justified the use of armed force:  “The fact that rulers are unjust and wicked does not excuse  tumult and rebellion; to punish wickedness does not  belong to everybody, but to the worldly rulers who bear  the sword. As for biblical support for the peasants’ demands,  he maintained that Scripture had nothing to do  with earthly justice or material gain, a position that  Zwingli supported.4 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Massive revolts first broke out near the Swiss frontier  and then swept through Swabia, Thuringia, the Rhineland,  and Saxony. The crowds’ slogans came directly  from Protestant writings. “God’s righteousness and the  “Word of God were invoked in an effort to secure social  and economic justice. The peasants who expected  Luther’s support were soon disillusioned. Freedom for  Luther meant independence from the authority of the  Roman church; it did not mean opposition to legally established  secular powers.

Historians  estimate that more than seventy-five thousand  peasants were killed in 1525. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The German Peasants’ War of 1525 greatly strengthened  the authority of lay rulers. Not surprisingly, the Reformation  lost much of its popular appeal after 1525,  though peasants and urban rebels sometimes found a  place for their social and religious ideas in radical groups.  Peasants’ economic conditions did moderately improve,  however. For example, in many parts of Germany, enclosed  fields, meadows, and forests were returned to  common use. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Reformation and Marriage "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" At the same time they were reacting so harshly to radicals  and peasants, Luther and Zwingli decided to marry,  Luther to a former nun, Katharina von Bora (1499–  1532), and Zwingli to a Zurich widow, Anna Reinhart  (1491–1538). Both women quickly had several children.  Most other Protestant reformers also married, and their  wives had to create a new and respectable role for themselves— pastor’s wife—to overcome being viewed as simply  a new type of priest’s concubine. They were living  demonstrations of their husband’s convictions about the  superiority of marriage to celibacy, and they were expected  to be models of wifely obedience and Christian  charity. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Though they denied that marriage was a sacrament,  many Protestant reformers praised marriage in formal  treatises, commentaries on the Book of Genesis, household  guides, and—most importantly—wedding sermons.  They stressed that it had been ordained by God when he  presented Eve to Adam, served as a “remedy for the  unavoidable sin of lust, provided a site for the pious  rearing of the next generation of God-fearing Christians,  and offered husbands and wives companionship and  consolation. A proper marriage was one that reflected  both the spiritual equality of men and women and the  proper social hierarchy of husbandly authority and wifely  obedience. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Protestants did not break with medieval scholastic theologians  in their idea that women were to be subject to  men, a subjection rooted in their original nature and  made more pronounced by Eve’s primary responsibility  for the Fall. Women were advised to be cheerful rather  than grudging in their obedience, for in doing so they "}

A few women took  Luther’s idea about the priesthood of all believers to  heart and wrote religious pamphlets and hymns, but no  sixteenth-century Protestants officially allowed women  to hold positions of religious authority, though monarchs  such as Elizabeth I of England and female territorial  rulers of the states of the Holy Roman Empire did  determine religious policies.

Protestants  saw marriage as a contract in which each partner promised  the other support, companionship, and the sharing  of mutual goods.

Using a go-between for proposals  was very common, as was having  a double wedding portrait  painted.

The licensed  brothels that were a common feature of late medieval urban  life (see page 394) were closed in Protestant cities,  and harsh punishments were set for prostitution.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Closing the official brothels did not end the exchange  of sex for money, of course, but simply reshaped it.  Smaller illegal brothels were established, or women moved  to areas right outside city walls. Police and other authorities  were influenced or bribed to overlook such activities.  For Italian city authorities, this fluid situation was  more worrisome, and they tended to favor regulation  over suppression. They also viewed selling sex as a significant  source of municipal income. From 1559 until the  mid-eighteenth century in Florence, for example, all  women registered as prostitutes were required to contribute  an annual tax based on their income, which went  to support a convent for women who wished to give up  prostitution. Payment of extra taxes would allow a woman  to live where she wished in the city and wear any type of  clothes she chose, rather than having to follow the sumptuary  laws requiring prostitutes to dress a certain way  (see page 394). "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Protestant Reformation clearly had a positive impact  on marriage, but its impact on women was more  mixed. Many nuns had lacked a religious vocation, but  convents nevertheless provided women of the upper  classes with scope for their literary, artistic, medical, or  administrative talents if they could not or would not  marry. The Reformation generally brought the closing of  monasteries and convents, and marriage became virtually  the only occupation for upper-class Protestant women.  Women in some convents recognized this and fought the  Reformation, or argued that they could still be pious  Protestants within convent walls. Most nuns left, however,  and we do not know what happened to them. The  Protestant emphasis on marriage made unmarried women  (and men) suspect, for they did not belong to the type  of household regarded as the cornerstone of a proper,  godly society. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Reformation and  German Politics "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Criticism of the church was widespread in Europe in the  early sixteenth century, and calls for reform came from  many areas. It was no accident, however, that the reformer  whose ideas had the most impact lived in the politically  divided Holy Roman Empire. Unlike Spain,  France, and England, the Holy Roman Empire lacked a  strong central power. The emperor was elected in a process  established by the Golden Bull of 1356, a decree issued  by the Holy Roman emperor Charles IV (and "}

There were  only seven electors—the archbishops of Mainz, Trier,  and Cologne, the margrave of Brandenburg, the duke of  Saxony, the count palatine of the Rhine, and the king of  Bohemia. All these individuals were powerful, but so  were many other nobles and church officials who ruled  the hundreds of largely independent states in the empire. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Against this background of decentralization and strong  local power, Martin Luther had launched a movement  to reform the church. Two years after Luther published  the Ninety-five Theses, the electors chose as emperor  a nineteen-year-old Habsburg prince who ruled as  Charles V. The course of the Reformation was shaped by  this election and by the political relationships surrounding  it. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" • How did the political situation in Germany shape the  course of the Reformation?  The Rise of the Habsburg Dynasty "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" War and diplomacy were important ways that states increased  their power in sixteenth-century Europe, but so  was marriage. Because almost all of Europe was ruled by  hereditary dynasties—the Papal States and a few cities being  the exceptions—claiming and holding resources involved  shrewd marital strategies, for it was far cheaper to  gain land by inheritance than by war. Royal and noble  sons and daughters were important tools of state policy.  Even popes and city leaders were often part of such marital  strategies; papal nieces, nephews, and sometimes children  were coveted marriage partners, as were the wealthy  daughters of urban elites. Wealthy urban families, especially  in Italy, also transformed themselves into hereditary  dynasties through coups and alliances during this period,  and they cemented their position through marriages with  more established ruling houses. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The benefits of an advantageous marriage, particularly  if the wife had no brothers and thus inherited territory,  stretched across generations, a process that can be seen  most dramatically with the Habsburgs. The Holy Roman  emperor Frederick III, a Habsburg who was the ruler of  most of Austria, acquired only a small amount of territory— but a great deal of money—with his marriage to  Princess Eleonore of Portugal in 1452. He arranged for  his son Maximilian to marry Europe’s most prominent  heiress, Mary of Burgundy, in 1477; she inherited the  Netherlands, Luxembourg, and the County of Burgundy  in what is now eastern France. Through this union with  the rich and powerful duchy of Burgundy, the Austrian  house of Habsburg, already the strongest ruling family in "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" “Other nations wage war; you, happy Austria, marry.  Historians dispute the origins of this adage, but no one  questions its accuracy, at least in terms of marriage. (The  frequency with which the Habsburgs went to war make  the saying somewhat ironic.) Maximilian learned the lesson  of marital politics well, marrying his son and daughter  to the children of Ferdinand and Isabella, the rulers of  Spain, much of southern Italy, and eventually the Spanish  New World empire. His grandson Charles V (1500–  1558) fell heir to a vast conglomeration of territories.  Through a series of accidents and unexpected deaths,  Charles inherited Spain from his mother, her New World  possessions, and the Spanish dominions in Italy, Sicily,  and Sardinia. From his father he inherited the Habsburg  lands in Austria, southern Germany, the Low Countries,  and Franche-Comté in east-central France. Charles would  eventually rule about half of Europe. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Charles’s inheritance was an incredibly diverse collection  of states and peoples, each governed in a different  manner and held together only by the person of the emperor  (see Map 14.1 on page 460). Charles’s Italian adviser,  the grand chancellor Gattinara, told the young  ruler, “God has set you on the path toward world monarchy.  Charles not only believed this but also was convinced  that it was his duty to maintain the political and  religious unity of Western Christendom. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Political Impact of the  Protestant Reformation "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the sixteenth century the practice of religion remained  a public matter. Everyone participated in the religious life  of the community, just as almost everyone shared in the  local agricultural work. Whatever spiritual convictions individuals  held in the privacy of their consciences, the emperor,  king, prince, magistrate, or other civil authority  determined the official form of religious practice in his  (or occasionally her) jurisdiction. Almost everyone believed  that the presence of a faith different from that of  the majority represented a political threat to the security  of the state. Only a tiny minority, and certainly none of  the rulers, believed in religious liberty. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Against this background, the religious storm launched  by Martin Luther swept across Germany. Anticlericalism  blended with hostility to the papacy, which was increasingly  seen as Italian rather than international. Papal tax "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" collectors had long been more active in the empire than  they were in the more unified nation-states such as  France, where royal power restricted them. Luther and  other reformers highlighted papal financial exploitation  of Germany in their sermons and pamphlets. Though  Germany was not a nation, people did have an understanding  of being German because of their language and  traditions. Luther frequently used the phrase “we Germans  in his attacks on the papacy. Luther’s appeal to  German patriotism gained him strong support, and national  feeling influenced many rulers otherwise confused  by or indifferent to the complexities of the religious issues.  Some German rulers were sincerely attracted to  Lutheran ideas, but material considerations swayed many  others to embrace the new faith. The rejection of Roman  Catholicism and adoption of Protestantism would mean  the legal confiscation of lush farmlands, rich monasteries,  and wealthy shrines. A steady stream of duchies, margraviates,  free cities, and bishoprics secularized church  property, accepted Lutheran theological doctrines, and  adopted simpler services conducted in German. Thus  many political authorities in the empire used the religious  issue to extend their financial and political power and to  enhance their independence from the emperor. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Charles V was a vigorous defender of Catholicism,  however, so it is not surprising that the Reformation led  to religious wars. The first battleground was Switzerland,  which was officially part of the Holy Roman Empire,  though it was really a loose confederation of thirteen  largely autonomous territories called “cantons. Some  cantons remained Catholic, and some became Protestant,  and in the late 1520s the two sides went to war.  Zwingli was killed on the battlefield in 1531, and both  sides quickly decided that a treaty was preferable to further  fighting. The treaty basically allowed each canton to  determine its own religion and ordered each side to give  up its foreign alliances, a policy of neutrality that has  been characteristic of modern Switzerland. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Trying to halt the spread of religious division, Charles V  called an Imperial Diet in 1530, to meet at Augsburg.  The Lutherans developed a statement of faith, later called  the Augsburg Confession, and the Protestant princes  presented this to the emperor. (The Augsburg Confession  remained an authoritative statement of belief for  many Lutheran churches for centuries.) Charles refused  to accept it and ordered all Protestants to return to the  Catholic Church and give up any confiscated church  property. This threat backfired, and Protestant territories  in the empire—mostly north German princes and south  German cities—formed a military alliance.

The  emperor, the pope, France, England, Protestant and  Catholic princes and cities in Germany, Scotland, Sweden,  Denmark, and even the Turks made and broke alliances,  and the Habsburg-Valois rivalry continued to be played  out militarily. Various attempts were made to heal the religious  split with a church council, but intransigence on  both sides made it increasingly clear that this would not  be possible and that war was inevitable. Charles V realized  that he was fighting not only for religious unity, but  also for a more unified state against territorial rulers who  wanted to maintain their independence. He was thus defending  both church and empire. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Fighting began in 1546, and initially the emperor was  very successful. This success alarmed both France and the  pope, however, who did not want Charles to become  even more powerful. The pope withdrew papal troops,  and the Catholic king of France sent money and troops  to the Lutheran princes. Finally, in 1555 Charles agreed  to the Peace of Augsburg, which, in accepting the status  quo, officially recognized Lutheranism.

Catherine had originally  been married to his older brother Arthur, who had died  as a youth. Marriage to a brother’s widow went against  canon law, and Henry had been required to obtain a  special papal dispensation to marry Catherine. The  marriage was about average for royal marriages—they  neither especially hated nor loved one another—but it  had produced only one living heir, a daughter, Mary. By  1527 Henry decided that God was showing his displeasure  with the marriage by denying him a son, and he appealed  to the pope to have the marriage annulled. He  was also in love with a court lady-in-waiting, Anne Boleyn,  and assumed that she would give him the son he  wanted. Normally an annulment would not have been a  problem, but the troops of Emperor Charles V were in  Rome at that point, and Pope Clement VII was essentially  their prisoner. Charles V was the nephew of Catherine  of Aragon and thus was vigorously opposed to an  annulment, which would have declared his aunt a fornicator  and his cousin Mary a bastard. (An annulment declares  that there never was a marriage, making children  of such a union illegitimate.)

Luther inadvertently launched  the Protestant Reformation. Calvin, however, had the  greater impact on future generations. His theological  writings profoundly influenced the social thought and attitudes  of Europeans and English-speaking peoples all  over the world, especially in Canada and the United  States. Although he had originally intended to have an  ecclesiastical career, Calvin studied law, which had a decisive  impact on his mind and later thought. In 1533 he  experienced a religious crisis, as a result of which he converted  to Protestantism. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Convinced that God selects certain people to do his  work, Calvin believed that God had specifically called  him to reform the church. Accordingly, he accepted an  invitation to assist in the reformation of the city of  Geneva.

Geneva,  “a city that was a church, became the model of a  Christian community for sixteenth-century Protestant  reformers. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" To understand Calvin’s Geneva, it is necessary to understand  Calvin’s ideas.

{"prompt":"","completion":" and omnipotence of God and the total weakness of humanity.  Before the infinite power of God, he asserted,  men and women are as insignificant as grains of sand. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Calvin did not ascribe free will to human beings because  that would detract from the sovereignty of God.  Men and women cannot actively work to achieve salvation;  rather, God in his infinite wisdom decided at the beginning  of time who would be saved and who damned.  This viewpoint constitutes the theological principle called  predestination: "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Predestination we call the eternal decree of God, by which  he has determined in himself, what he would have become  of every individual....For they are not all created with a  similar destiny; but eternal life is foreordained for some, and  eternal damnation for others....In conformity, therefore,  to the clear doctrine of the Scripture, we assert, that by an  eternal and immutable counsel, God has once for all determined,  both whom he would admit to salvation, and whom  he would condemn to destruction....To those whom he devotes  to condemnation, the gate of life is closed by a just and  irreprehensible, but incomprehensible, judgment. How exceedingly  presumptuous it is only to inquire into the causes  of the Divine will; which is in fact, and is justly entitled to  be, the cause of everything that exists....For the will of  God is the highest justice; so that what he wills must be considered  just, for this very reason, because he wills it.6 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Many people consider the doctrine of predestination,  which dates back to Saint Augustine and Saint Paul, to be  a pessimistic view of the nature of God, who, they feel,  revealed himself in the Old and New Testaments as merciful  as well as just. But “this terrible decree, as even  Calvin called it, did not lead to pessimism or fatalism.  Rather, the Calvinist believed in the redemptive work of  Christ and was confident that God had elected (saved)  him or her. Predestination served as an energizing dynamic,  forcing a person to undergo hardships in the constant  struggle against evil. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Calvin aroused Genevans to a high standard of morality.  He had two remarkable assets: complete mastery of  the Scriptures and exceptional eloquence. Through his  sermons and a program of religious education, God’s  laws and man’s were enforced in Geneva. Calvin’s powerful  sermons delivered the Word of God and thereby  monopolized the strongest contemporary means of communication:  preaching. Through his Genevan Catechism,  published in 1541, children and adults memorized set  questions and answers and acquired a summary of their  faith and a guide for daily living. Calvin’s sermons and his  Catechism gave a whole generation of Genevans thorough  instruction in the reformed religion.7 "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" In the reformation of the city, the Genevan Consistory  also exercised a powerful role. This body consisted of  twelve laymen plus the Company of Pastors, of which  Calvin was the permanent moderator (presider). The duties  of the Consistory were “to keep watch over every  man’s life [and] to admonish amiably those whom they  see leading a disorderly life. Even though Calvin emphasized  that the Consistory’s activities should be thorough  and “its eyes may be everywhere, corrections were  considered only “medicine to turn sinners to the Lord.8 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Although all municipal governments in early modern  Europe regulated citizens’ conduct, none did so with the  severity of Geneva’s Consistory under Calvin’s leadership.  Nor did it make any distinction between what we  would consider crimes against society and simple un- Christian conduct. Absence from sermons, criticism of  ministers, dancing, card playing, family quarrels, and  heavy drinking were all investigated and punished by the "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \f Consistory. Serious crimes and heresy were handled by  the civil authorities, which, with the Consistory’s approval,  sometimes used torture to extract confessions.  Between 1542 and 1546 alone seventy-six persons were  banished from Geneva and fifty-eight executed for heresy,  adultery, blasphemy, and witchcraft. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Calvin reserved his harshest condemnation for religious  dissenters, declaring them “dogs and swine: "}

The father should not  spare his child,... nor husband his own wife or the friend  who is dearer to him than life. No human relationship is  more than animal unless it be grounded in God.9 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the 1550s Spanish humanist Michael Servetus had  gained international notoriety for his publications denying  the Christian dogma of the Trinity. Servetus had  been arrested by the Inquisition but escaped to Geneva,  where he was promptly rearrested. At his trial, he not  only held to his belief that there is no scriptural basis for  the Trinity but also rejected child baptism and insisted  that a person under twenty cannot commit a mortal sin.  The city fathers considered this last idea dangerous to  public morality, “especially in these days when the young  are so corrupted. Though Servetus begged that he be  punished by banishment, Calvin and the town council  maintained that the denial of child baptism and the Trinity  amounted to a threat to all society. Servetus was  burned at the stake. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" To many sixteenth-century Europeans Calvin’s Geneva  seemed “the most perfect school of Christ since the days  of the Apostles. Religious refugees from France, England,  Spain, Scotland, and Italy visited the city. Subsequently,  the Reformed church of Calvin served as the  model for the Presbyterian church in Scotland, the Huguenot  church in France, and the Puritan churches in  England and New England. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Calvinism became the compelling force in international  Protestantism. The Calvinist ethic of the “calling dignified  all work with a religious aspect. Hard work, well  done, was pleasing to God. This doctrine encouraged an  aggressive, vigorous activism. These factors, together with  the social and economic applications of Calvin’s theology,  made Calvinism the most dynamic force in sixteenth- and  seventeenth-century Protestantism. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Calvinism found a ready audience in Scotland. There as  elsewhere, political authority was the decisive influence in  reform. The monarchy was weak, and factions of virtually  independent nobles competed for power. King James V  and his daughter Mary, Queen of Scots (r. 1560–1567),  staunch Catholics and close allies of Catholic France, opposed  reform. The Scottish nobles supported it. One  man, John Knox (1505?–1572), dominated the movement  for reform in Scotland. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In 1559 Knox, a dour, single-minded, and fearless man  with a reputation as a passionate preacher, set to work reforming  the church. He was determined to structure the  Scottish church after the model of Geneva, where he had  studied and worked with Calvin. In 1560 Knox persuaded  the Scottish parliament, which was dominated by reform- minded barons, to enact legislation ending papal authority.  The Mass was abolished. Knox then established the  Presbyterian Church of Scotland, so named because presbyters,  or ministers, not bishops, governed it. The Church  of Scotland was strictly Calvinist in doctrine, adopted a  simple and dignified service of worship, and laid great  emphasis on preaching. Knox’s Book of Common Order  (1564) became the liturgical directory for the church.  The Presbyterian Church of Scotland was a national, or  state, church, and many of its members maintained close  relations with English Puritans. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Reformation in Eastern Europe "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" While political and economic issues determined the  course of the Reformation in western and northern Europe,  ethnic factors often proved decisive in eastern Europe.  In the later Middle Ages, the migration of diverse  peoples into Bohemia, Poland, and Hungary meant that  those countries had heterogeneous populations in the  sixteenth century. Ethnic background tended to resolve  religious matters. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In Bohemia in the fifteenth century, the ethnic grievances  of the Czech majority against German economic  and ecclesiastical domination (see page 391) fused with  Czech resentment at the corruption of the Roman church.  By 1500 most Czechs had adopted the ideas of Jan Hus,  and the emperor had been forced to recognize a separate  Hussite church. Lutheranism spread rapidly among Germans  in Bohemia in the 1520s and 1530s; many Germans  lived near the border of Luther’s Saxony.  Moreover, the nobility’s identification of Lutheranism "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" By 1500 Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania  were united in a dynastic union. A king, senate, and diet  (parliament) governed, but the two territories retained  separate officials, judicial systems, armies, and forms of  citizenship. In the fifteenth century rulers had granted  the Polish szlachta (nobility) extensive rights; though  hereditary, the monarchy was weak and had to cooperate  with the szlachta. The combined realms covered about  440,150 square miles, making Poland-Lithuania the largest  European polity. A population of only about 7.5 million  people was very thinly scattered over that land. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In comparison with western Europe, Poland-Lithuania  was overwhelmingly rural; its largest cities—Gdansk  (30,000) and Cracow (15,000)—were very small in population  by Italian or French standards. Yet with Germans,  Italians, Tartars, and Jews, Poland-Lithuania represented  great diversity. Such peoples had come as merchants, invited  by medieval rulers because of their wealth or to  make agricultural improvements. Each group spoke its  native language, though all educated people spoke Latin.  In the late fifteenth century Italian Renaissance humanism  influenced Polish art, architecture, literature, and  historical writing. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Luther’s ideas spread first to the German-speaking  Baltic towns, then to the University of Cracow, where his  works were translated. His ideas met two major obstacles:  King Sigismund I (r. 1506–1548) banned Luther’s  teachings in Poland, and strong anti-German feeling  among Poles meant that Lutheranism would have limited  success outside Germanized towns. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Reformed tradition of John Calvin, with its stress  on the power of church elders, appealed to the Polish  szlachta, however. The fact that Calvinism originated  in France, not in Germany, also made it more attractive  than Lutheranism. Several Polish magnates, including  Jan Laski (1499–1560), converted to Calvinism,  and Calvinist nobles dominated the important diet of  1555. But doctrinal differences among Calvinists, Lutherans,  and other groups prevented united opposition to  Catholicism. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Under Stanislaus Hosius (1505–1579), who attended  the Council of Trent, a systematic Counter-Reformation  gained momentum.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Merchants from Poland carried the first news about  Martin Luther to Hungary in 1521. Hungarian students  flocked to Wittenberg; they became the major agents for  the spread of Lutheranism in Hungary, and sympathy for  it developed at the royal court at Buda. But concern  about “the German heresy by the Catholic hierarchy  and among the magnates found expression in a decree of  the Hungarian diet in 1523 that “all Lutherans and those  favoring them . . . should have their property confiscated  and themselves punished with death as heretics.10 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A military event on August 26, 1526, had profound  consequences for both the Hungarian state and the  Protestant Reformation there. On the plain of Mohács in  southern Hungary, the Ottoman sultan Suleiman the  Magnificent (see page 566) inflicted a crushing defeat on  the Hungarians, killing King Louis II, many of the magnates,  and more than sixteen thousand ordinary soldiers.  Rival factions elected different kings, and the Hungarian  kingdom was divided into three parts: the Ottoman  Turks absorbed the great plains, including the capital,  Buda; the Habsburgs ruled the north and west; and  Ottoman-supported Janos Zapolya held eastern Hungary  and Transylvania. The Turks were indifferent to the religious  conflicts of the infidels. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Mohács led to a great advance of Protestantism. Many  Magyar (Hungarian) magnates accepted Lutheranism;  Lutheran schools and parishes headed by men educated  at Wittenberg multiplied; and peasants welcomed the  new faith. In spite of the foundation of Jesuit colleges, in  1585 the papal nuncio noted that 85 percent of the population  was Protestant, 10 percent remained Greek Orthodox,  and just 5 percent (concentrated in Croatia)  stayed Catholic. Hungary seemed lost to Catholicism.  Then, in the late seventeenth century, Hungarian nobles’  recognition of Habsburg (Catholic) rule and Ottoman  Turkish withdrawal in 1699 led to Catholic restoration. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Between 1517 and 1547 Protestantism made remarkable  advances. Nevertheless, the Roman Catholic Church  made a significant comeback. After about 1540 no new  large areas of Europe, other than the Netherlands, accepted  Protestant beliefs (see Map 14.2). Many historians  see the developments within the Catholic Church  after the Protestant Reformation as two interrelated "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \f movements: one a drive for internal reform linked to earlier  reform efforts, and the other a Counter-Reformation  that opposed Protestants intellectually, politically, militarily,  and institutionally. In both movements, the papacy,  new religious orders, and the Council of Trent that met  from 1545 to 1563 were important agents. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" • How did the Catholic Church respond to the new  religious situation?  The Reformed Papacy "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Renaissance princes who sat on the throne of Saint  Peter were not blind to the evils that existed. Modest reform  efforts were undertaken, but the idea of reform was  closely linked to the idea of a general council representing  the entire church. Remembering fifteenth-century  conciliar attempts to limit papal authority, early sixteenth- century popes resisted calls for a council. The papal bureaucrats  who were the popes’ intimates warned the  popes against a council, fearing loss of power, revenue,  and prestige. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This changed beginning with Pope Paul III (1534–  1549), and the papal court became the center of the reform  movement rather than its chief opponent. Paul appointed  reform-minded cardinals, abbots, and bishops  who improved education for the clergy, tried to enforce  moral standards among them, and worked on correcting  the most glaring abuses. Reform measures that had been  suggested since the late Middle Ages, such as prohibiting  pluralism and absenteeism, were gradually adopted during  the sixteenth century. Paul III and his successors supported  the establishment of new religious orders that  preached to the common people, the opening of seminaries  for training priests, the end of the selling of church  offices, and stricter control of clerical life. Their own lives  were models of decorum and piety, in contrast to Renaissance  popes who had concentrated on building and decorating  churches and palaces and on enhancing the  power of their own families. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In 1542 Pope Paul III established the Sacred Congregation  of the Holy Office, with jurisdiction over the Roman  Inquisition, a powerful instrument of the Catholic  Reformation. The Inquisition was a committee of six cardinals  with judicial authority over all Catholics and the  power to arrest, imprison, and execute. Under the fervent  Cardinal Caraffa, it vigorously attacked heresy. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Within the Papal States, the Inquisition effectively destroyed  heresy (and some heretics). Outside the papal  territories, however, its influence was slight. In Venice, a  major publishing center, the Index had no influence on  scholarly research in nonreligious areas such as law, classical  literature, and mathematics. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Council of Trent "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Pope Paul III also called an ecumenical council, which  met intermittently from 1545 to 1563 at Trent, an imperial  city close to Italy. It was called not only to reform  the church but also to secure reconciliation with the  Protestants. Lutherans and Calvinists were invited to participate,  but their insistence that the Scriptures be the  sole basis for discussion made reconciliation impossible.  International politics repeatedly cast a shadow over the  theological debates. Charles V opposed discussions on  any matter that might further alienate his Lutheran subjects,  fearing the loss of additional imperial territory to  Lutheran princes. Meanwhile, the French kings worked  against the reconciliation of Roman Catholicism and  Lutheranism. As long as religious issues divided the German  states, the empire would be weakened, and a weak  and divided empire meant a stronger France. Portugal,  Poland, Hungary, and Ireland sent representatives, but  very few German bishops attended. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In spite of the obstacles, the achievements of the  Council of Trent were impressive. The council dealt with  both doctrinal and disciplinary matters. It gave equal  validity to the Scriptures and to tradition as sources of  religious truth and authority. It reaffirmed the seven  sacraments and the traditional Catholic teaching on transubstantiation.  Thus it rejected Lutheran and Calvinist  positions. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The council tackled the problems arising from ancient  abuses by strengthening ecclesiastical discipline. Tridentine  (from Tridentum, the Latin word for Trent) decrees  required bishops to reside in their own dioceses, suppressed  pluralism and simony, and forbade the sale of indulgences.  Clerics who kept concubines were to give  them up. The jurisdiction of bishops over all the clergy of  their dioceses was made almost absolute, and bishops  were ordered to visit every religious house within the  diocese at least once every two years.

{"prompt":"","completion":" One decision had especially important social consequences  for laypeople. Since the time of the Roman Empire,  many couples had treated marriage as a completely  personal matter, had exchanged vows privately without  witnesses, and had thus formed what were called clandestine  (secret) unions. This widespread practice frequently  led later to denials by one party, conflicts over property,  and disputes in the ecclesiastical courts that had jurisdiction  over marriage once it became a sacrament (which  occurred in the twelfth century). The Tridentine decree  Tametsi (November 1563) stipulated that for a marriage  to be valid, consent (the essence of marriage) as given in  the vows had to be made publicly before witnesses, one  of whom had to be the parish priest. Trent thereby ended  secret marriages in Catholic countries. (They remained a  problem for civil and church courts in England until the  Hardwicke Act of 1753 abolished them.) "}

Education was a major goal of  the two most famous orders. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Ursuline order of nuns, founded by Angela Merici  (1474–1540), attained enormous prestige for the education  of women. The daughter of a country gentleman,  Angela Merici worked for many years among the  poor, sick, and uneducated around her native Brescia in  northern Italy. In 1535 she established the Ursuline order  to combat heresy through Christian education. The  first women’s religious order concentrating exclusively  on teaching young girls, the Ursulines sought to re- Christianize society by training future wives and mothers.  Because the Council of Trent placed great stress on  the claustration (strict enclosure) of religious women and  called for the end of all active ministries for women,  Angela had great difficulty gaining papal approval. Official  recognition finally came in 1565, and the Ursulines  rapidly spread to France and the New World. Their  schools in North America, stretching from Quebec to  New Orleans, provided superior education for young  women and inculcated the spiritual ideals of the Catholic  Reformation. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Society of Jesus, or Jesuits, founded by Ignatius  Loyola (1491–1556), a former Spanish soldier, played a  powerful international role in resisting the spread of  Protestantism, converting Asians and Latin American Indians  to Catholicism, and spreading Christian education  all over Europe. While recuperating from a severe battle  wound in his legs, Loyola studied a life of Christ and  other religious books and decided to give up his military  career and become a soldier of Christ. During a year  spent in seclusion, prayer, and personal mortification, he  gained insights that went into his great classic, Spiritual  Exercises (1548). This work, intended for study during a  four-week period of retreat, directed the individual imagination  and will to the reform of life and a new spiritual  piety. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Loyola was a man of considerable personal magnetism.  After study at universities in Salamanca and Paris, he  gathered a group of six companions and in 1540 secured  papal approval of the new Society of Jesus. The first  Jesuits, recruited primarily from the wealthy merchant  and professional classes, saw the Reformation as a pastoral  problem, its causes and cures related not to doctrinal  issues but to people’s spiritual condition. Reform  of the church, as Luther and Calvin understood that  term, played no role in the future the Jesuits planned  for themselves. Their goal was “to help souls. Loyola  also possessed a gift for leadership that consisted in spotting  talent and in seeing “how at a given juncture change  is more consistent with one’s scope than staying the  course.12 "}

Candidates underwent a  two-year novitiate, in contrast to the usual one-year probation.

Juan’s  son Alzonzo Sanchez de Cepeda married a woman of  thoroughly Christian background, giving his family an  aura of impeccable orthodoxy.

{"prompt":"","completion":" At age twenty, inspired more by the fear of Hell  than the love of God, Teresa (1515–1582) entered the  Carmelite Convent of the Incarnation in vila. Most of  the nuns were daughters of vila’s leading citizens;  they had entered the convent because of a family decision  about which daughters would marry and which  would become nuns. Their lives were much like those  of female family members outside the convent walls,  with good food, comfortable surroundings, and frequent  visits from family and friends. Teresa was frequently  ill, but she lived quietly in the convent for  many years. In her late thirties, she began to read devotional  literature intensely and had profound mystical  experiences—visions and voices in which Christ chastised  her for her frivolous life and friends. She  described one such experience in 1560: "}

When he drew it  out . . . he left me completely afire with the great love  of God.* "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Teresa responded with a new sense of purpose: although  she encountered stiff opposition, she resolved  to found a reformed house. Four basic principles were  to guide the new convent. First, poverty was to be fully  observed, symbolized by the nuns’ being barefoot,  hence discalced. Charity and the nuns’ own work must  support the community. Second, the convent must keep  strict enclosure; the visits of powerful benefactors with "}

Though Teresa did not advocate  institutionalized roles for women outside the convent,  she did chafe at the restrictions placed on her  because of her sex, and she thought of the new religious  houses she founded as answers to the Protestant  takeover of Catholic churches elsewhere in Europe.  From her brother, who had obtained wealth in the  Spanish colonies, Teresa learned about conditions in  Peru and instructed her nuns “to pray unceasingly for  the missionaries working among the heathens.  Through prayer, Teresa wrote, her nuns could share in  the exciting tasks of evangelization and missionary  work otherwise closed to women.

{"prompt":"","completion":" In 1559 France and Spain signed the Treaty of Cateau- Cambrésis, which ended the long conflict known as the  Habsburg-Valois Wars. Spain was the victor. France, exhausted  by the struggle, had to acknowledge Spanish  dominance in Italy, where much of the fighting had taken  place. The Treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis did not bring  peace, however. Instead, over the next century religious  differences led to riots, civil wars, and international conflicts.  Especially in France and the Netherlands, Protestants  and Catholics used violent actions as well as  preaching and teaching against each other, for each side  regarded the other as a poison in the community that  would provoke the wrath of God. Catholics continued to  believe that Calvinists and Lutherans could be reconverted;  Protestants persisted in thinking that the Roman  church should be destroyed. Catholics and Protestants  alike feared people of other faiths, who they often saw as  agents of Satan. Even more, they feared those who were  explicitly identified with Satan: witches living in their  midst. The era of religious wars was also the time of the  most virulent witch persecutions in European history, as  both Protestants and Catholics tried to make their cities  and states more godly. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" • What were the causes and consequences of religious  violence, including riots, wars, and witch-hunts?  French Religious Wars "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Habsburg-Valois Wars, waged intermittently through  the first half of the sixteenth century, cost more than  the French government could afford. In addition to the  time-honored practices of increasing taxes and engaging  in heavy borrowing, King Francis I (r. 1515–1547) tried  two new devices to raise revenue: the sale of public offices  and a treaty with the papacy. The former proved to  be only a temporary source of money. The offices sold  tended to become hereditary within a family, and once a  man bought an office he and his heirs were exempt from  taxation. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The treaty with the papacy was the Concordat of  Bologna (see page 435), in which Francis agreed to recognize  the supremacy of the papacy over a universal  council. In return, the French crown gained the right to "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \f appoint all French bishops and abbots. This understanding  gave the monarchy a rich supplement of money and  offices and a power over the church that lasted until the  Revolution of 1789. The Concordat of Bologna helps  explain why France did not later become Protestant: in  effect, it established Catholicism as the state religion. Because  French rulers possessed control over appointments  and had a vested financial interest in Catholicism, they  had no need to revolt against Rome. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Luther’s tracts first appeared in France in 1518, and  his ideas attracted some attention. After the publication  of Calvin’s Institutes in 1536, sizable numbers of French  people were attracted to the “reformed religion, as Calvinism  was called. Because Calvin wrote in French rather  than Latin, his ideas gained wide circulation. Initially,  Calvinism drew converts from among reform-minded  members of the Catholic clergy, the industrious middle  classes, and artisan groups. Most French Calvinists  (called Huguenots) lived in major cities, such as Paris,  Lyons, and Rouen. When Henry II died in 1559, perhaps  one-tenth of the population had become Calvinist. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The feebleness of the French monarchy was the seed  from which the weeds of civil violence sprang. The three  weak sons of Henry II who occupied the throne could  not provide the necessary leadership, and they were often  dominated by their mother, Catherine de’ Medici. The  French nobility took advantage of this monarchical  weakness. In the second half of the sixteenth century between  two-fifths and one-half of the nobility at one time  or another became Calvinist. Just as German princes in  the Holy Roman Empire had adopted Lutheranism as a  means of opposition to Emperor Charles V, so French  nobles frequently adopted the reformed religion as a  religious cloak for their independence. Armed clashes between  Catholic royalist lords and Calvinist antimonarchical  lords occurred in many parts of France. Both  Calvinists and Catholics believed that the others’ books,  services, and ministers polluted the community. Preachers  incited violence, and ceremonies such as baptisms,  marriages, and funerals triggered it. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Protestant teachings called the power of sacred images  into question, and mobs in many cities took down and  smashed statues, stained-glass windows, and paintings.  They ridiculed and tested religious images, throwing  them into latrines, using them as cooking fuel or building  material, or giving them as toys or masks for children.  Though it was often inspired by fiery Protestant sermons,  this iconoclasm is an example of men and women  carrying out the Reformation themselves, rethinking the  church’s system of meaning and the relationship between  the unseen and the seen. Catholic mobs responded by "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" A savage Catholic attack on Calvinists in Paris on August  24, 1572 (Saint Bartholomew’s Day), followed the  usual pattern. The occasion was a religious ceremony,  the marriage of the king’s sister Margaret of Valois to  the Protestant Henry of Navarre, which was intended to  help reconcile Catholics and Huguenots. Instead Huguenot  wedding guests in Paris were massacred, and other  Protestants were slaughtered by mobs. Religious violence  spread to the provinces, where thousands were  killed. This Saint Bartholomew’s Day massacre led to a  civil war that dragged on for fifteen years. Agriculture in  many areas was destroyed; commercial life declined severely;  and starvation and death haunted the land. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What ultimately saved France was a small group of  moderates of both faiths called politiques who believed  that only the restoration of strong monarchy could reverse  the trend toward collapse. No religious creed was  worth the incessant disorder and destruction. Therefore,  the politiques favored accepting the Huguenots as an officially  recognized and organized pressure group. (But  religious toleration, the full acceptance of peoples of different  religious persuasions within a pluralistic society,  with minorities having the same civil liberties as the majority,  developed only in the eighteenth century.) The  death of Catherine de’ Medici, followed by the assassination  of King Henry III, paved the way for the accession  of Henry of Navarre (the unfortunate bridegroom of the  Saint Bartholomew’s Day massacre), a politique who became  Henry IV (r. 1589–1610). "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Henry knew that the majority of the French were Roman  Catholics. Allegedly saying “Paris is worth a Mass,  Henry knelt before the archbishop of Bourges and was  received into the Roman Catholic Church. Henry’s willingness  to sacrifice religious principles to political necessity  saved France. The Edict of Nantes, which Henry  published in 1598, granted liberty of conscience and liberty  of public worship to Huguenots in 150 fortified  towns, such as La Rochelle. The reign of Henry IV and  the Edict of Nantes prepared the way for French absolutism  in the seventeenth century by helping restore internal  peace in France. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Emperor Charles V (r. 1519–1556) had inherited the  seventeen provinces that compose present-day Belgium  and the Netherlands (see page 458). Each of the seventeen  provinces of the Netherlands possessed historical  liberties: each was self-governing and enjoyed the right  to make its own laws and collect its own taxes. In addition  to important economic connections, only the recognition  of a common ruler in the person of Emperor  Charles V united the provinces. The cities of the Netherlands  made their living by trade and industry. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the Low Countries as elsewhere, corruption in the  Roman church and the critical spirit of the Renaissance  provoked pressure for reform, and Lutheran ideas spread.  Charles V had grown up in the Netherlands, however,  and he was able to limit their impact. In 1556 Charles V  abdicated, dividing his territories between his brother  Ferdinand, who received Austria and the Holy Roman  Empire, and his son Philip, who inherited Spain, the Low  Countries, Milan and the kingdom of Sicily, and the  Spanish possessions in the Americas. Philip had grown up  in Spain and did not understand the Netherlands. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" By the 1560s Protestants in the Netherlands were primarily  Calvinists, not Lutherans, and were more militant  in their beliefs. Calvinism appealed to the middle classes  because of its intellectual seriousness, moral gravity, and  emphasis on any form of labor well done. It took deep  root among the merchants and financiers in Amsterdam  and the northern provinces. Working-class people were  also converted. Whereas Lutherans taught respect for the  powers that be, Calvinism tended to encourage opposition  to “illegal civil authorities. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the 1560s Spanish authorities attempted to suppress  Calvinist worship and raised taxes, which sparked riots.  Thirty churches in Antwerp were sacked and the religious  images in them destroyed in a wave of iconoclasm.  From Antwerp the destruction spread to Brussels and  Ghent and north to the provinces of Holland and Zeeland.  From Madrid Philip II sent twenty thousand Spanish  troops under the duke of Alva to pacify the Low  Countries. Alva interpreted “pacification to mean the  ruthless extermination of religious and political dissidents.  On top of the Inquisition, he opened his own tribunal,  soon called the “Council of Blood.

{"prompt":"","completion":" The Great European Witch-Hunt "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The relationship between the Reformation and the upsurge  in trials for witchcraft that occurred at roughly the  same time is complex. Increasing persecution for witchcraft  actually began before the Reformation in the 1480s,  but it became especially common about 1560. Religious  reformers’ extreme notions of the Devil’s powers and the  insecurity created by the religious wars contributed to  this increase. Both Protestants and Catholics tried and  executed witches, with church officials and secular authorities  acting together. They regarded both their religious  opponents and witches as deluded by the Devil but  made a clear distinction between them; heretics might  merit burning, but they were only rarely accused of  witchcraft. Witches were a special kind of heretic, but  their primary crime was a pact with the Devil, not incorrect  doctrine. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The heightened sense of God’s power and divine  wrath in the Reformation era was an important factor in  the witch-hunts, but other factors were also significant.  One of these was a change in the idea of what a witch  was. Nearly all premodern societies believe in witchcraft  and make some attempts to control witches, who are  understood to be people who use magical forces to do  evil deeds. Witches themselves often believe in their own  powers, which they can use to earn a living or gain influence  over their neighbors. In the later Middle Ages,  however, many educated Christian theologians, canon  lawyers, and officials added a demonological component  to this notion of what a witch was. For them, the essence  of witchcraft was making a pact with the Devil that required  the witch to do the Devil’s bidding. Witches were  no longer simply people who used magical power to get  what they wanted, but rather people used by the Devil to  do what he wanted. This demonological or Satanic idea  of witchcraft was fleshed out, and witches were thought to  engage in wild sexual orgies with the Devil, fly through  the night to meetings called sabbats, which parodied the  Mass, and steal communion wafers and unbaptized babies  to use in their rituals. Some demonological theorists  also claimed that witches were organized in an international  conspiracy to overthrow Christianity, with a hierarchy  similar to the hierarchy of angels and archangels  that Christian philosophers had invented. Witchcraft was "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Trials involving this new notion of witchcraft as diabolical  heresy began in Switzerland and southern Germany  in the late fifteenth century, became less numerous  in the early decades of the Reformation when Protestants  and Catholics were busy fighting each other, and then  picked up again about 1560. Because so many records  have been lost or destroyed, it is difficult to make an estimate  for all of Europe, but most scholars agree that during  the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries somewhere  between 100,000 and 200,000 people were officially tried "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" for witchcraft and between 40,000 and 60,000 were  executed. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Though the gender balance varied widely in different  parts of Europe, between 75 and 85 percent of those  tried and executed were women. Ideas about women,  and the roles women actually played in society, were  thus important factors shaping the witch-hunts. Some  demonologists expressed virulent misogyny, or hatred of  women, and particularly emphasized women’s powerful  sexual desire, which could be satisfied only by a demonic  lover. Most people viewed women as weaker and so more  likely to give in to any kind of offer by the Devil, including  better food or nicer clothing. Women were associated  with nature, disorder, and the body, all of which were  linked with the demonic. Women’s actual lack of power  in society and gender norms about the use of violence  meant that they were more likely to use scolding and  cursing to get what they wanted instead of taking people  to court or beating them up. Curses were generally expressed  (as they often are today) in religious terms; “go  to Hell was calling on the powers of Satan. Women also  had more contact with areas of life in which bad things  happened unexpectedly, such as preparing food or caring  for new mothers, children, and animals. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Learned ideas about the diabolical nature of witchcraft  gradually filtered down to common people. Illustrated  pamphlets and broadsides portrayed witches riding  on pitchforks to sabbats where they engaged in anti- Christian acts such as spitting on the communion host  and having sexual relations with demons. Though witch  trials were secret, executions were not; they were public  spectacles witnessed by huge crowds, with the list of  charges read out for all to hear. By the late sixteenth century  popular accusations of witchcraft in many parts of  Europe involved at least some parts of the demonic conception  of witchcraft. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Legal changes also played a role in causing, or at least  allowing for, massive witch trials. One of these was a  change from an accusatorial legal procedure to an inquisitorial  procedure. In the former, a suspect knew the  accusers and the charges they had brought, and an accuser  could in turn be liable for trial if the charges were  not proven; in the latter, legal authorities themselves  brought the case. This change made people much more  willing to accuse others, for they never had to take personal  responsibility for the accusation or face the accused’s  relatives. Inquisitorial procedure involved intense  questioning of the suspect, often with torture; areas in  Europe that did not make this change saw very few trials.  Torture was also used to get the names of additional sus"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" pects, as most lawyers firmly believed that no witch could  act alone. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The use of inquisitorial procedure did not always lead  to witch-hunts, however. The most famous inquisitions  in early modern Europe, those in Spain, Portugal, and  Italy, were in fact very lenient in their treatment of people  accused of witchcraft: the Inquisition in Spain executed  only a handful of witches, the Portuguese Inquisition  only one, and the Roman Inquisition none, though in  each of these areas there were hundreds of cases. Inquisitors  certainly believed in the power of the Devil and were  no less misogynist than other judges, but they doubted  very much whether the people accused of witchcraft had  actually made pacts with the Devil that gave them special  powers. They viewed such people not as diabolical Devil- worshipers but as superstitious and ignorant peasants  who should be educated rather than executed. Thus  most people brought up before the Inquisition for witchcraft  were sent home with a warning and a penance. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Most witch trials began with a single accusation in a  village or town. Individuals accused someone they knew  of using magic to spoil food, make children ill, kill animals,  raise a hailstorm, or do other types of harm. Tensions  within families, households, and neighborhoods  often played a role in these accusations. Women number  very prominently among accusers and witnesses as well  as among those accused of witchcraft because the actions  witches were initially charged with, such as harming  children or curdling milk, were generally part of  women’s sphere. A woman also gained economic and social  security by conforming to the standard of the good  wife and mother and by confronting women who deviated  from it. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Once a charge was made, judges began to question  other neighbors and acquaintances, building up a list of  suspicious incidents that might have taken place over  decades. Historians have pointed out that one of the reasons  those accused of witchcraft were often older was  that it took years to build up a reputation as a witch. At  this point, the suspect was brought in for questioning by  legal authorities. Judges and inquisitors sought the exact  details of a witch’s demonic contacts, including sexual  ones. Suspects were generally stripped and shaved in a  search for a “witch’s mark, or “pricked to find a spot  insensitive to pain, and then tortured. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Detailed records of witch trials survive for many parts of  Europe.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Religious Violence • 477 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Once the initial suspect had been questioned, and particularly  if he or she had been tortured, the people who  had been implicated were brought in for questioning.  This might lead to a small hunt, involving from five to  ten victims, and it sometimes grew into a much larger  hunt, what historians have called a “witch panic. Panics  were most common in the part of Europe that saw the  most witch accusations in general—the Holy Roman  Empire, Switzerland, and parts of France. Most of this  area consisted of very small governmental units, which  were jealous of each other and after the Reformation  were divided by religion. The rulers of these small territories  often felt more threatened than did the monarchs  of western Europe, and they saw persecuting witches as a  way to demonstrate their piety and concern for order. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Sometimes witch panics were the result of legal authorities’  rounding up a group of suspects together. Such  panics often occurred after some type of climatic disaster,  such as an unusually cold and wet summer, and they  came in waves. In large-scale panics a wider variety of suspects  were taken in—wealthier people, children, a greater  proportion of men. Mass panics tended to end when it  became clear to legal authorities, or to the community itself,  that the people being questioned or executed were  not what they understood witches to be, or that the  scope of accusations was beyond belief. Some from their  community might be in league with Satan, they thought,  but not this type of person and not as many as this. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Similar skepticism led to the gradual end of witch- hunts in Europe. Even in the sixteenth century a few individuals  questioned whether witches could ever do  harm, make a pact with the Devil, or engage in the wild  activities attributed to them. Doubts about whether secret  denunciations were valid or torture would ever yield  a truthful confession gradually spread among the same  type of religious and legal authorities who had so vigorously  persecuted witches. Prosecutions for witchcraft  became less common and were gradually outlawed. Sporadic  trials continued into the eighteenth century, but by  then people who thought themselves witches were more  likely to be regarded as deluded or mentally defective,  meriting pity rather than persecution, even by people  who still firmly believed in the Devil. Belief in the power  of witches continued among uneducated people, but educated  people now sneered at this as superstition. People  ceased to bring formal accusations when they knew they  would simply be dismissed, and witch trials ended. The  last official execution for witchcraft in England was in  1682, though the last one in the Holy Roman Empire  was not until 1775. "}

Chapter Summary "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Catholic Church in the early sixteenth century had  serious problems, and many individuals and groups had  long called for reform. This background of discontent  helps explain why Martin Luther’s ideas found such a  ready audience. Luther and other Protestants developed  a new understanding of Christian doctrine that emphasized  faith, the power of God’s grace, and the centrality  of the Bible. Protestant ideas were attractive to educated  people and urban residents, and they spread rapidly  through preaching, hymns, and the printing press. By  1530 many parts of the Holy Roman Empire and Scandinavia  had broken with the Catholic Church. Some  reformers developed more radical ideas about infant  baptism, the ownership of property, and separation between  church and state. Both Protestants and Catholics  regarded these as dangerous, and radicals were banished  or executed. The German Peasants’ War, in which Luther’s  ideas were linked to calls for social and economic reform,  was similarly put down harshly. The Protestant reformers  did not break with medieval ideas about the proper gender  hierarchy, though they did elevate the status of marriage  and viewed orderly households as the key building  blocks of society.

{"prompt":"","completion":" The progress of the Reformation was shaped by the  political situation in the Holy Roman Empire.

{"prompt":"","completion":" In England the political issue of the royal succession  triggered the break with Rome, and a Protestant church  was established. Protestant ideas also spread into France  and eastern Europe. In all these areas, a second generation  of reformers built on Lutheran and Zwinglian ideas  to develop their own theology and plans for institutional  change. The most important of the second-generation  reformers was John Calvin, whose ideas would come to  shape Christianity over a much wider area than did  Luther’s. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Roman Catholic Church responded slowly to the  Protestant challenge, but by the 1530s the papacy was  leading a movement for reform within the church instead  of blocking it. Catholic doctrine was reaffirmed at the  Council of Trent, and reform measures such as the opening  of seminaries for priests and a ban on holding multiple  church offices were introduced. New religious orders  such as the Jesuits and the Ursulines spread Catholic  ideas through teaching, and in the case of the Jesuits  through missionary work. "}

War ended  in France with the Edict of Nantes in which Protestants  were given some civil rights, and in the Netherlands with  a division of the country into a Protestant north and  Catholic south. The era of religious wars was also the  time of the most extensive witch persecutions in European  history, as both Protestants and Catholics tried to  rid their cities and states of people they regarded as  linked to the Devil.

{"prompt":"","completion":" The idea of liberty or freedom has played a  powerful role in the history of Western society and  culture, but the meaning and understanding of liberty  has undergone continual change and interpretation.  In the Roman world, where slavery was a basic  institution, liberty meant the condition of being a free  man, independent of obligations to a master. In the  Middle Ages possessing liberty meant having special  privileges or rights that other persons or institutions  did not have. A lord or a monastery, for example,  might speak of his or its liberties, and citizens in  London were said to possess the “freedom of the city,  which allowed them to practice trades and  own property without interference. Likewise, the first  chapter of Magna Carta (1215), often called the  “Charter of Liberties, states: “Holy Church shall  be free and have its rights entire and its liberties  inviolate, meaning that the English church was  independent of the authority of the king. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The idea of liberty also has a religious dimension,  and the reformer Martin Luther formulated a classic  interpretation of liberty in his treatise On Christian  Liberty (sometimes translated On the Freedom of a  Christian), arguably his finest piece. Written in Latin  for the pope but translated immediately into German  and published widely, it contains the main themes  of Luther’s theology: the importance of faith, the  relationship of Christian faith and good works, the  dual nature of human beings, and the fundamental  importance of Scripture. Luther writes that  Christians were freed from sin and death through  Christ, not through their own actions. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Christian faith has appeared to many an easy thing;  nay, not a few even reckon it among the social  virtues, as it were; and this they do because they  have not made proof of it experimentally, and have  never tasted of what efficacy it is. For it is not  possible for any man to write well about it, or to  understand well what is rightly written, who has  not at some time tasted of its spirit, under the  pressure of tribulation; while he who has tasted "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" of it, even to a very small extent, can never write,  speak, think, or hear about it sufficiently.... "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I hope that ...I have attained some little  drop of faith, and that I can speak of this matter, if  not with more elegance, certainly with more  solidity.... "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A Christian man is the most free lord of all,  and subject to none; a Christian man is the most  dutiful servant of all, and subject to everyone. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Although these statements appear contradictory,  yet, when they are found to agree together, they  will do excellently for my purpose. They are both  the statements of Paul himself, who says, “Though  I be free from all men, yet have I made myself a  servant unto all (I Cor. 9:19), and “Owe no man  anything but to love one another (Rom. 13:8).  Now love is by its own nature dutiful and obedient  to the beloved object. Thus even Christ, though  Lord of all things, was yet made of a woman; made  under the law; at once free and a servant; at once  in the form of God and in the form of a servant. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Let us examine the subject on a deeper and less  simple principle. Man is composed of a twofold  nature, a spiritual and a bodily. As regards the  spiritual nature, which they name the soul, he is  called the spiritual, inward, new man; as regards  the bodily nature, which they name the flesh, he  is called the fleshly, outward, old man. The Apostle  speaks of this: “Though our outward man perish,  yet the inward man is renewed day by day (II  Cor. 4:16). The result of this diversity is that in the  Scriptures opposing statements are made  concerning the same man, the fact being that in  the same man these two men are opposed to one  another; the flesh lusting against the spirit, and the  spirit against the flesh (Gal. 5:17). "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" We first approach the subject of the inward man,  that we may see by what means a man becomes  justified, free, and a true Christian; that is, a  spiritual, new, and inward man. It is certain that  absolutely none among outward things, under  whatever name they may be reckoned, has any  influence in producing Christian righteousness or "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \f liberty, nor, on the other hand, unrighteousness or  slavery. This can be shown by an easy argument. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What can it profit to the soul that the body should  be in good condition, free, and full of life, that it  should eat, drink, and act according to its pleasure,  when even the most impious slaves of every kind of  vice are prosperous in these matters? Again, what  harm can ill health, bondage, hunger, thirst, or any  other outward evil, do to the soul, when even the  most pious of men, and the freest in the purity of  their conscience, are harassed by these things?  Neither of these states of things has to do with the  liberty or the slavery of the soul. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And so it will profit nothing that the body should  be adorned with sacred vestment, or dwell in holy  places, or be occupied in sacred offices, or pray, fast,  and abstain from certain meats, or do whatever  works can be done through the body and in the  body. Something widely different will be necessary  for the justification and liberty of the soul, since the  things I have spoken of can be done by an impious  person, and only hypocrites are produced by  devotion to these things. On the other hand, it will  not at all injure the soul that the body should be  clothed in profane raiment, should dwell in profane  places, should eat and drink in the ordinary fashion,  should not pray aloud, and should leave undone all  the things above mentioned, which may be done by  hypocrites. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" . . . One thing, and one alone, is necessary for life,  justification, and Christian liberty; and that is the  most Holy Word of God, the Gospel of Christ, as He  says, “I am the resurrection and the life; he that  believeth in me shall not die eternally (John 9:25),  and also, “If the Son shall make you free, ye shall be  free indeed (John 8:36), and “Man shall not live by  bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out  of the mouth of God (Matt. 4:4). "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Let us therefore hold it for certain and firmly  established that the soul can do without everything  except the Word of God, without which none at all  of its wants is provided for. But, having the Word, it  is rich and wants for nothing, since that is the Word  of life, of truth, of light, of peace, of justification, of  salvation, of joy, of liberty, of wisdom, of virtue, of  grace, of glory, and of every good thing. . . . "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But you will ask, “What is this Word, and by what  means is it to be used, since there are so many words  of God? I answer, “The Apostle Paul (Rom. 1)  explains what it is, namely the Gospel of God,  concerning His Son, incarnate, suffering, risen, and  glorified through the Spirit, the Sanctifier. To  preach Christ is to feed the soul, to justify it, to set it  free, and to save it, if it believes the preaching. For  faith alone, and the efficacious use of the Word of "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" On effective preaching, especially to the uneducated,  Luther urged the minister “to keep it simple for the  simple. (Church of St. Marien, Wittenberg\/The Bridgeman  Art Library) "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" God, bring salvation. “If thou shalt confess with thy  mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine  heart that God hath raised Him from the dead, thou  shalt be saved (Rom. 9:9); . . . and “The just shall  live by faith (Rom. 1:17). . . . "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But this faith cannot consist of all with works; that  is, if you imagine that you can be justified by those  works, whatever they are, along with it. . . .  Therefore, when you begin to believe, you learn at  the same time that all that is in you is utterly guilty,  sinful, and damnable, according to that saying, “All  have sinned, and come short of the glory of God  (Rom. 3:23). ...When you have learned this, you  will know that Christ is necessary for you, since He  has suffered and risen again for you, that, believing  on Him, you might by this faith become another  man, all your sins being remitted, and you being  justified by the merits of another, namely Christ  alone. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" . . . [A]nd since it [faith] alone justifies, it is  evident that by no outward work or labour can the  inward man be at all justified, made free, and saved;  and that no works whatever have any relation to  him. . . . Therefore the first care of every Christian  ought to be to lay aside all reliance on works, and  strengthen his faith alone more and more, and by it  grow in knowledge, not of works, but of Christ  Jesus, who has suffered and risen again for him, as  Peter teaches (I Peter 5).

The European  search for Southeast Asian spices led to a new overseas empire in  the Indian Ocean and the accidental discovery of the Western Hemisphere.  Within a short time, South and North America had joined a  worldwide economic and imperial web. The results were trading networks  and political empires of truly global proportions. The era of “globalization  had begun. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" European states’ intrusions into Indian Ocean trade and into new  economies in the New World gave them wealth and power. Over time  the old Asian-dominated trading world gave way to a new European- dominated one that encompassed the vast territories of the Americas and  the Pacific Ocean. Global contacts created new forms of cultural exchange,  assimilation, conversion, and resistance. Europeans sought to impose their  cultural values on the people they encountered and struggled to comprehend  the peoples and societies they found. New forms of racial prejudice  emerged in this period, but so did new openness and curiosity about  different ways of life. Together with the developments of the Renaissance  and the Reformation, the Age of Discovery laid the foundations for the  modern world as we know it today. "}

The global impact of the discoveries  in the New World must be viewed in the context  of this world trading system, which it would in turn revolutionize. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" • What was the Afro-Eurasian trading world before  Columbus?  The Trading World of the Indian Ocean "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The center of the pre-Columbian world trade network  was the Indian Ocean, the globe’s third-largest waterway  (after the Atlantic and Pacific). To the west its arms reach  into the Red and Arabian Seas, through the former to the  Mediterranean Sea, and through the latter into the Persian  Gulf and southwestern Asia. To the north the Indian  Ocean joins the Bay of Bengal; to the east the Pacific; and  to the south the west coast of Australia (see Map 15.1).  The monsoon winds blow from the west or south between  April and August, and from the northwest or  northeast between December and March. These seasonal  climate patterns determined the rhythms of trade. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The location of the Indian Ocean made it a crossroads  for commercial and cultural exchange. Since Han and Roman  times, seaborne trade between China (always the biggest  market for Southeast Asian goods), India, the Middle  East, Africa, and Europe had flowed across the Indian  Ocean. From the seventh through the thirteenth centuries,  the volume of this trade steadily increased. After a  period of decline resulting from the Black Death, demand  for Southeast Asian goods accelerated once more in the  late fourteenth century. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Merchants congregated in a series of port cities strung  around the ocean that harbored a bewildering array of  peoples and cultures. The most developed area of this  commercial web lay to the east on the South China Sea.  In the fifteenth century the port of Malacca became a  great commercial entrepôt, to which goods were shipped  for temporary storage while awaiting redistribution to  other places. To Malacca came Chinese porcelains, silks,  and camphor (used in the manufacture of many medications,  including those to reduce fevers); pepper, cloves,  nutmeg, and raw materials such as sappanwood and san"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" dalwood from the Moluccas; sugar from the Philippines;  and Indian printed cotton and woven tapestries, copper  weapons, incense, dyes, and opium. Merchants at Malacca  stockpiled goods in fortified warehouses while waiting  for the next monsoon. With its many mosques and elegant  homes, Malacca enjoyed the reputation of being a  sophisticated city, full of “music, ballads, and poetry.1 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Women in Southeast Asia enjoyed relatively high autonomy.  Their important role in planting and harvesting  rice, the traditional agricultural crop, gave them authority  and economic power. In contrast to Europe, the more  daughters a Southeast Asian man had, the richer he was.  At marriage the groom paid the bride (or sometimes her  family) a sum of money, called bride wealth, which remained  under her control. This practice was in sharp  contrast to the European dowry, which was provided by  the wife’s family and came under the husband’s control.  Married couples usually resided in the wife’s village and  administered property jointly. All children, regardless of  gender, inherited equally, and even after Islam took root  in parts of the region, the rule that sons receive double  the inheritance of daughters was never implemented. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This respect for women’s capacity to handle financial  affairs carried over to the commercial sphere. Women  participated in business as independent entrepreneurs or  partners in family businesses, even undertaking long sea  voyages to accompany their wares. When Portuguese and  Dutch men settled in the region and married local women,  their wives continued to play an important role in trade  and commerce. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" China played a key role in the fifteenth-century revival  of Indian Ocean trade. Given its size and its sophisticated  artisanal production, China was an economic powerhouse.  Historians agree that medieval China had the  most advanced economy in the world; one scholar’s controversial  theory is that its economic superiority to the  West continued to 1800.2 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Mongol emperors opened the doors of China to  the West, encouraging European traders like Marco Polo  to do business there. Marco Polo’s tales of his travels  from 1271 to 1295 and his encounter with the Great  Khan fueled Western fantasies about the exotic “Orient.  Unbeknownst to the West, the Mongols fell to the new  Ming Dynasty in 1368. During the Ming Dynasty (1368–  1644), China entered a period of agricultural and commercial  expansion, population growth, and urbanization.  By the end of the dynasty, the Chinese population had  doubled to perhaps 100 million people. The city of Nanjing  had one million inhabitants, making it the largest  city in the world, while the new capital, Beijing, had  more than six hundred thousand inhabitants. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \f Population growth was one reason for the Chinese desire  for more goods. Another was the celebrated naval  expeditions led by Admiral Zheng He. Between 1405  and 1433 Zheng He led seven voyages to achieve the  emperor Yongle’s diplomatic, political, geographical, and  commercial goals. Yongle wanted to secure China’s hegemony  over tributary states and form new tribute-paying  relations with profitable trade centers. Zheng He’s first  fleet was composed of 317 ships—including junks, supply  ships, water tankers, warships, transports for horses,  and patrol boats—carrying twenty-eight thousand sailors  and soldiers. Because it bore tons of beautiful porcelains,  elegant silks, lacquer ware, and exquisite artifacts to be exchanged  for goods abroad, the Chinese called it the “treasure  fleet. Sailing as far west as Egypt, the expeditions  brought back spices, books, hardwood, and a giraffe from  the kingdom of Mali for the imperial zoo. Zheng He may  have been appointed commander because as a Muslim he  could more easily negotiate with Muslim merchants on  the Indian Ocean. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Court conflicts and the need to defend against renewed  Mongol encroachment led to the abandonment of the  expeditions and shipbuilding after the deaths of Zheng  He and the emperor. Despite the Chinese decision not  to pursue overseas voyages, trade continued in the South  China Sea. A vast immigration of Chinese people to  Southeast Asia, sometimes called the Chinese diaspora,  followed the expeditions. Immigrants carried with them  Chinese culture, including social customs, diet, and practical  objects of Chinese technology—calendars, books,  scales for weights and measures, and musical instruments. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Another center of trade in the Indian Ocean was India,  the crucial link between the Persian Gulf and the  Southeast Asian and East Asian trade networks. The subcontinent  had ancient links with its neighbors to the  northwest: trade between South Asia and Mesopotamia  dates back to the origins of civilization. Fashionable  women of the Roman Empire were addicted to Indian  cotton; and until the decline of Rome exotic animals,  ivory, and Chinese silk also made their way to Europe  through India. Trade with the Indian Ocean was revived  by Arab merchants who circumnavigated India on their  way to trade in the South China Sea. The need for stopovers  led to the establishment of trading posts at Gujarat  and on the Malabar coast, where the cities of Calicut and  Quilon became thriving commercial centers. "}

As one historian stated, “before the  arrival of the Portuguese . . . in 1498 there had been no  organised attempt by any political power to control the  sea-lanes and the long-distance trade of Asia. . . .

{"prompt":"","completion":" Mansa Musa used his wealth to invest in new mosques  and religious schools, making Timbuktu a renowned  center of culture and learning. The Muslim traveler Ibn  Battuta visited the city and remarked on the rigorous discipline  in its religious schools and also on the “extraordinary  state of affairs between men and women. Not only  did families trace descent through the mother’s line, but  the “women show no bashfulness before men and do not  veil themselves, though they are assiduous in attending  the prayers.4 Both husbands and wives, he reported,  could have “friends and “companions of the opposite  sex without provoking dishonor or jealousy. By the time  the Portuguese arrived, however, the Malian empire was  fading, to be replaced by the Songhay, who themselves  fell to Moroccan invasion at the end of the sixteenth century.  The Portuguese diversion of gold away from the  trans-Sahara routes weakened this area politically and  economically, and led to its decline as a center of Islamic  scholarship. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gold was one important object of trade; slaves were  another. Slavery was practiced in Africa, as virtually  everywhere else in the world, before the arrival of Europeans.  Arabic and African merchants crossed the Sahara  in both directions with slaves. They took West African  slaves to the Mediterranean to be sold in European,  Egyptian, or Mideastern markets and also brought eastern  Europeans—a major element of European slavery—  to West Africa as slaves. In addition, Indian and Arabic  merchants traded slaves in the coastal regions of East  Africa. European contact would revolutionize the magnitude  and character of African slavery (see page 508). "}

Along this route  traveled slaves, fur and timber to the east, and Asian luxury  goods to the west. Even more important were the two  southern sea routes that brought products from the Indian  Ocean trading system. The first came across the Arabian  Sea and then up the Red Sea past Aden to Cairo.  The second led past Hormuz up the Persian Gulf and on  to Baghdad. Standing at the mouths of two seas, Aden  and Hormuz had vital economic and strategic importance.  From the magnificent capitals of Cairo and Baghdad,  goods were sent to bustling trading posts on the  eastern Mediterranean coast, such as Alexandria, Damascus,  Beirut, and Aleppo. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Two great rival Islamic empires, the Turkish Ottomans  and the Persian Safavids, dominated this region. The Ottomans  combined excellent military strategy with efficient  administration of their conquered territories. Under Sultan  Mohammed II (r. 1451–1481), the Ottomans captured  Constantinople in May 1453, sending shock waves  through Europe. Renamed Istanbul, the city became the  capital of the Ottoman Empire. With a population of  600,000 to 750,000, it was by far the largest city in Europe  and the Middle East and rivaled the great Chinese  cities in size. "}

In  1516 the sultan’s forces took Syria and Palestine, followed  by Egypt in 1517 and the rest of northern Africa.  After defeating the Hungarian king in 1526 and bringing  portions of his kingdom into the empire, Suleiman  turned to the Habsburg state ruled by Ferdinand I, brother  to Habsburg emperor Charles V. In 1529 the Turks  besieged the Habsburg capital of Vienna. After a siege  of several weeks and high casualties on both sides, the  Turks retreated, leaving Vienna as the westward limit of  Ottoman expansion into Europe. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Ottoman expansion had political, economic, and religious  goals. The Ottomans wished to control the Balkans  and the Mediterranean so as to monopolize trade routes  with the West and spread Islamic rule. The Balkans themselves  were a precious source of timber, dye, and silver.  With the defeat of the Mameluke empire, expansion into  Egypt gave the Ottomans new access to sources of African  gold and control over Red Sea shipping. Similarly,  conquest of Baghdad brought control of shipping west  out of the Persian Gulf. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Europeans were not alone in opposing Ottoman ambitions.  In the early sixteenth century the Persian Safavid  Empire became a powerful Muslim state, reaching its  height under Shah Abbas I (r. 1587–1629).

Persian merchants  could be found throughout this trading world in  diaspora communities they formed as far away as the Indian  Ocean. Persia was also a major producer and exporter  of silk. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Safavids had complex, often hostile relations with  their Ottoman neighbors. Although both were Muslim  states, the Ottomans’ Sunni faith clashed with the Persians’  adherence to Shi’ism. Economically, the two competed  for control over trade routes to the east.

In many ways Islam helped foster commerce by offering  a common Islamic commercial law and culture; however,  there were also many divisions among Muslims. Rivalries  among European powers as well as among Muslim states  like the Sunni Ottomans and the Shi’ite Persians encouraged  a shifting pattern of pragmatic and self-interested  alliances that breached the borders supposedly dividing  East and West. Eventually the Turks formed a loose alliance  with the Portuguese against the Persians, which  helped both sides ameliorate their trading positions. For  his part, Shah Abbas I sent emissaries to Europe seeking  alliances against the Ottomans. He offered trade concessions  to the English for their help in eliminating the Portuguese  from Hormuz.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Genoese and Venetian Middlemen "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Europe was the western terminus of the world trading  system. Before the Portuguese and Spanish voyages, the  Italian city-states of Venice and Genoa controlled the  European luxury trade with the East. Centuries-old rivals  for this trade, Venice and Genoa both lost importance  with the rise of Ottoman power in the eastern Mediterranean  and with Portuguese, then Dutch, intrusion into  the spice trade at its source. After a brilliant period during  the late Middle Ages, they entered a long period of  decline. However, Italian experience in colonial administration,  slaving, and international trade and finance served  as crucial models for the Iberian states as they pushed European  expansion to new heights. Mariners, merchants,  and financiers from Venice and Genoa—most notably  Christopher Columbus—played a crucial role in bringing  the fruits of this experience to the Iberian Peninsula. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Venice grew in importance with the creation of the  Crusader kingdoms, gaining territory and special trading  concessions in return for aiding the Crusader armies.

{"prompt":"","completion":" the sultan of Mameluke Egypt, opening permanent offices  in Cairo, the gateway to trade from India, Southeast  Asia, and China. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Venice specialized in expensive luxury goods like spices,  silks, and carpets. Venetian traders did not, as later Europeans  did, explore new routes to get to the sources of  supply of these goods. Instead, they obtained them from  middlemen in the eastern Mediterranean and Asia Minor.  A little went a long way. Venetians purchased no more  than five hundred tons of spices a year around 1400, but  with a profit of around 40 percent. The most important  by far was pepper, grown in India and Indonesia, which  composed 60 percent of the spices they purchased in  1400. In all, one historian has estimated that 70 percent  of the Western trade in spices belonged to the Venetians.6  Other imported goods included grain and sugar from  Egypt and silk and cotton from Syria. Venetian merchants  redistributed these goods throughout Europe. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Another major element of Venetian trade was slavery.  Venetian merchants purchased slaves, many of whom  were fellow Christians, in the Balkans. The men went to  Egypt for the sultan’s army or to work as agricultural  laborers on Venetian possessions in the Mediterranean.  Young girls, who made up the majority of the trade,  were sold in western Mediterranean ports as servants or  concubines. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Venetians exchanged Eastern luxury goods for  European products they could trade abroad, including  Spanish and English wool, German metal goods, Flemish  textiles, and silk cloth made in their own manufactures  with imported raw materials. The demand for such goods  in the East, however, was low. To make up the difference,  the Venetians earned currency in the shipping industry  and through trade in firearms and slaves. At least half of  what they traded with the East took the form of precious  metal, much of it acquired in Egypt and North Africa.  When the Portuguese arrived in Asia, they found Venetian  coins everywhere. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The spice trade brought riches and power to Venice.  After the catastrophe of the Black Death, Venice reached  the height of its glory in the 1400s. By 1500 the city’s  population was 120,000, making it one of the largest in  Europe. From its origins as a small fishing village in the  sixth century A.D., Venice had created a sizable empire.

Eager to improve Red Sea trade and to oppose Portuguese  attempts to monopolize the spice trade, the Ottomans  encouraged traders to bypass Portuguese ports.  Spices began to flow again through the Red Sea to  Venetian merchants in Cairo. By the 1600s, however, the  Dutch had succeeded in monopolizing this trade, ending  Venice’s centuries-old role as the main European entrepôt  for Asian spices. Venice also lost its eastern Mediterranean  colonies to Ottoman conquest, leading to a loss  of supplies of slaves and other trade goods. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" After the loss of the Black Sea—and thus the source  of slaves—to the Ottomans, the Genoese sought new  supplies in the West, taking the Guanches (indigenous  peoples from the Canary Islands), Muslim prisoners and  Jewish refugees from Spain, and by the early 1500s both  black and Berber Africans. With the growth of Spanish  colonies in the New World, Genoese merchants became  important players in the Atlantic slave trade. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" As we have seen, Europe was by no means isolated before  the voyages of exploration and the “discovery of the  New World; the Europeans were aware of and in contact  with the riches of the Indian Ocean trading world. From  the time of the Crusades, Italian merchants brought the  products of the East to luxury markets in Europe eager  for silks, spices, porcelain, and other fine goods. But because  they did not produce many products desired by  Eastern elites, Europeans were relatively modest players  in the Afro-Eurasian trading world. Their limited role  was reduced even further in the mid-fourteenth century,  when the Black Death, combined with the ravages of the  Mongol warlord Tamerlane, led to a collapse in trade  routes and commercial markets. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" From these lows, however, Europeans would soon undertake  new and unprecedented expansion. As population  and trade recovered, new European players entered  the scene, eager to spread Christianity and to undo Italian  dominance of trade with the East. A century after the  plague, Iberian explorers began the overseas voyages that  helped create the modern world, with staggering conse"}

{"prompt":"","completion":" • How and why did Europeans undertake ambitious  voyages of expansion that would usher in a new era of  global contact?  Causes of European Expansion "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" European expansion had multiple causes. By the middle  of the fifteenth century, Europe was experiencing a revival  of population and economic activity after the lows  of the Black Death. While this revival was not sufficient  to create population pressure in Europe, it did create  new demands for luxury goods from the East and for  spices in particular. The fall of Constantinople in 1453  and subsequent Ottoman control of trade routes created  obstacles to fulfilling these desires. Europeans needed to  find new sources of precious metal to trade with the Ottomans  or sources of supply for themselves and thereby  eliminate Ottoman interference. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Why were spices so desirable? Introduced into western  Europe by the Crusaders in the twelfth century, pepper,  nutmeg, ginger, mace, cinnamon, and cloves added flavor  and variety to the monotonous diet of Europeans.  Spices evoked the scent of the Garden of Eden; they  seemed a marvel and a mystery. It is also important to remember  that the term spices referred not only to flavorings  added to food but also to perfumes, medicines,  drugs, and dyes. Take, for example, cloves, for which Europeans  found many uses. If picked green and sugared,  the buds could be transformed into conserve (a kind of  jam); if salted and pickled, cloves became a flavoring for  vinegar. Cloves sweetened the breath. When added to  food or drink, cloves were thought to stimulate the appetite  and clear the intestines and bladder. When crushed  and powdered, they were a medicine rubbed on the forehead  to relieve head colds and applied to the eyes to  strengthen vision. Taken with milk, cloves were believed  to enhance the pleasures of sexual intercourse. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Apart from a desire for trade goods, religious fervor  was another important catalyst for expansion. The passion  and energy ignited by the Iberian reconquista encouraged  the Portuguese and Spanish to continue the  Christian crusade. Just seven months separated Isabella  and Ferdinand’s entry into Granada on January 2 and  Columbus’s departure westward on August 3, 1492.  Overseas exploration was in some ways a transfer of their  religious zeal, enthusiasm for conquest and expansion,  and certainty of God’s blessing on their ventures from  the European continent to new non-Christian territories. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \f Since organized Muslim polities such as the Ottoman  Empire were too strong to defeat, Iberians turned their  attention to non-Christian peoples elsewhere. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Combined with eagerness for profits and to spread  Christianity was the desire for glory and the urge to chart  new waters. Scholars have frequently described the European  discoveries as a manifestation of Renaissance curiosity  about the physical universe—the desire to know more  about the geography and peoples of the world. The detailed  journals kept by such voyagers as Christopher  Columbus and Antonio Pigafetta (a survivor of Magellan’s  world circumnavigation) attest to their wonder and  fascination with the new peoples and places they visited. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Individual explorers combined these motivations in  unique ways. Christopher Columbus was a devout Christian  who was increasingly haunted by messianic obsessions  in the last years of his life. As Bartholomew Diaz  put it, his own motives were “to serve God and His  Majesty, to give light to those who were in darkness and  to grow rich as all men desire to do. When Vasco da  Gama reached the port of Calicut, India, in 1498 and a  native asked what the Portuguese wanted, he replied,  “Christians and spices.8 The bluntest of the Spanish  conquistadors, Hernando Cortés, announced as he prepared  to conquer Mexico, “I have come to win gold, not  to plow the fields like a peasant.9 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Eagerness for exploration could be heightened by a lack  of opportunity at home. After the reconquista, enterprising  young men of the Spanish upper classes found their  economic and political opportunities greatly limited. As  a study of the Castilian city of Ciudad Real shows, the  ancient aristocracy controlled the best agricultural land  and monopolized urban administrative posts. Great merchants  and a few nobles (surprisingly, since Spanish law  forbade participation by nobles in commercial ventures)  dominated the textile and leather-glove manufacturing  industries. Consequently, many ambitious men turned to  the Americas to seek their fortunes.10 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Whatever the motivations, the voyages were made possible  by the growth of government power. Mariners and  explorers did not possess the massive sums needed to explore  mysterious oceans and control remote continents.  Reassertion of monarchical authority and state centralization  in the fifteenth century provided rulers with such  resources. In the fifteenth century Isabella and Ferdinand  had consolidated their several kingdoms to achieve a  more united Spain and had revamped the Spanish bureaucracy.  The Spanish monarchy was stronger than before  and in a position to support foreign ventures. In  Portugal the steadfast financial and moral support of  Prince Henry the Navigator led to Portugal’s phenome-"}

{"prompt":"","completion":" For ordinary sailors, life at sea was dangerous, overcrowded,  unbearably stench-ridden, filled with hunger,  and ill-paid. For months at a time, 100 to 120 people  lived and worked in a space of between 150 and 180  square meters, with no available water except a small  amount for drinking. Each person had an average of 1.5  meters of space, with more going to officers and wealthy  passengers.11 A lucky sailor would find enough space on  deck to unroll his sleeping mat. This is not to mention the  horses, cows, pigs, chickens, rats, and lice that accompanied  the voyages. As one scholar concluded, “traveling on  a ship must have been one of the most uncomfortable and  oppressive experiences in the world.12 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Why did men choose to go to sea? They did so to escape  poverty at home, to continue a family trade, to win a  few crumbs of the great riches of empire, or to find a better  life as illegal immigrants in the colonies. Moreover,  many orphans and poor boys were placed on board as  young pages and had little say in the decision. Women  also paid a price for the voyages of exploration. Left alone  for months or years at a time, and frequently widowed,  sailors’ wives struggled to feed their families. The widow  of a sailor lost on Magellan’s 1519 voyage had to wait until  1547 to collect her husband’s salary from the Crown.13 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The people who stayed at home had a powerful impact  on the process. Court coteries and factions influenced  a monarch’s decisions and could lavishly reward individuals  or cut them out of the spoils of empire. Then there  was the public: the small number of people who could  read were a rapt audience for tales of fantastic places and  unknown peoples. Cosmography, natural history, and geography  aroused enormous interest among educated  people in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Just as science  fiction and speculation about life on other planets  excite readers today, quasi-scientific literature about  Africa, Asia, and the Americas captured the imaginations  of literate Europeans. Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo’s  General History of the Indies (1547), a detailed eyewitness  account of plants, animals, and peoples, was widely  read. Indeed, the elite’s desire for the exotic goods  brought by overseas trade helped propel the whole process  of expansion. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Technological Stimuli to Exploration "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Technological developments in shipbuilding, weaponry,  and navigation provided another impetus for European  expansion. Since ancient times, most seagoing vessels had "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" been narrow, open boats called galleys, propelled largely  by manpower. Slaves or convicts who had been sentenced  to the galleys manned the oars of the ships that sailed  the Mediterranean, and both cargo ships and warships  carried soldiers for defense. Though well suited to the  placid and thoroughly explored waters of the Mediterranean,  galleys could not withstand the rough winds and  uncharted shoals of the Atlantic. The need for sturdier  craft, as well as population losses caused by the Black  Death, forced the development of a new style of ship that  would not require soldiers for defense or much manpower  to sail. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the course of the fifteenth century, the Portuguese  developed the caravel, a small, light, three-masted sailing  ship. Though somewhat slower than the galley, the  caravel held more cargo. Its triangular lateen sails and  sternpost rudder also made the caravel a much more  maneuverable vessel. When fitted with cannon, it could  dominate larger vessels, such as the round ships commonly  used as merchantmen. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" By 1350 cannon—iron or bronze guns that fired iron  or stone balls—had been fully developed. These pieces of  artillery emitted frightening noises and great flashes of  fire and could batter down fortresses and even city walls. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Early cannon posed serious technical difficulties. Iron  cannon were cheaper than bronze to construct, but they  were difficult to cast effectively and were liable to crack  and injure artillerymen. Bronze guns, made of copper  and tin, were less subject than iron to corrosion, but they  were very expensive. All cannon were extraordinarily difficult  to move, required considerable time for reloading,  and were highly inaccurate. They thus proved inefficient  for land warfare. However, they could be used at sea. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Great strides in cartography and navigational aids were  also made in this period. Around 1410 Arab scholars  reintroduced Europeans to Ptolemy’s Geography. Written  in the second century A.D. by a Hellenized Egyptian,  the work was a formidable synthesis of the geographical  knowledge of the classical world. Its republication provided  significant improvements over medieval cartography,  showing the world as round and introducing the  idea of latitude and longitude to plot position accurately.  Ptolemy’s work also contained crucial errors. Ignorant of  the existence of the Americas, he showed the world as  much smaller than it is, so that Asia appeared not very  distant from Europe to the west. Based on this work, cartographers  fashioned new maps that combined classical  knowledge with the latest information from mariners. "}

It shows  the world watered by a single  ocean, with land covering  three-quarters of the world’s  surface and with Europe,  Africa, and Asia as the only  continents. Africa and Asia are  joined, making the Indian  Ocean a landlocked sea and  rendering the circumnavigation  of Africa impossible.

"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" These arguments have encountered criticism in recent "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" years. Some scholars have emphasized the extent to which  European technology was borrowed from the East. For  example, gunpowder, the compass, and the sternpost  rudder were all Chinese inventions. The lateen sail,  which allowed European ships to tack against the wind,  was a product of the Indian Ocean trading world and was  brought to the Mediterranean on Arab ships. Navigational  aids, such as the astrolabe, were also acquired from  others, and advances in cartography drew on the rich tradition  of Judeo-Arabic mathematical and astronomical  learning in Iberia. This assistance sometimes assumed  human form. It was not his own seafaring abilities but assistance  from a local guide that helped Vasco da Gama  find a sea route from the East African coast to India. In  exploring new territories, European sailors thus called on  techniques and knowledge developed over centuries in  China and the trading world of the Indian Ocean. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Other historians have argued that technological advances  were in themselves not that important. Not only  were cannon inaccurate and unreliable, but in the tropical  conditions of Africa, India, and South America gunpowder  got wet and cannon did not fire. Native populations  quickly acquired firepower from Europeans who were  eager to profit from the weapons trade. These historians  have concluded that technological developments arose to  meet the needs of exploration, rather than being a necessary  precursor to them. To support this case, one scholar  points out that the first Portuguese voyages took place in  whatever boats were available and with crews unable to  make use of a compass or a sea chart. Columbus himself  relied on dead reckoning—at which he proved extremely  adept—rather than on new navigational devices. As this "}

Blocked from access to western Europe by  Spain, the Portuguese turned to the Atlantic and North  Africa, whose waters they knew better than almost any  other Europeans.

Portugal’s conquest  of Ceuta, an Arab city in northern Morocco, in 1415  marked the beginning of European exploration and control  of overseas territory. In the late 1420s, under Henry’s  direction, the Portuguese began to settle the Atlantic  islands of Madeira (ca 1420) and the Azores (1427). In  1443 the Portuguese founded their first African commercial  settlement at Arguim in present-day Mauritania.  By the time of Henry’s death in 1460, his support for  exploration was vindicated by thriving plantations on the  Atlantic islands and new access to gold. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" For centuries, port city-states had controlled the rich  spice trade of the Indian Ocean, and they did not surrender  it willingly. Portuguese commercial activities were  accompanied by the destruction or seizure of strategic  coastal forts, which later served Portugal as both trading  posts and military bases. Alfonso de Albuquerque, whom  the Portuguese crown appointed as governor of India  (1509–1515), decided that these bases, not inland territories,  should control the Indian Ocean. Accordingly, his  cannon blasted open the ports of Malacca, Calicut, Ormuz,  and Goa, the vital centers of Muslim domination of  South Asian trade. This bombardment laid the foundation  for Portuguese imperialism in the sixteenth and seventeenth  centuries—a strange way to bring Christianity  to “those who were in darkness. As one scholar wrote  about the opening of China to the West, “while Buddha  came to China on white elephants, Christ was borne on  cannon balls.16 "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" The Problem of Christopher Columbus "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The year 1992, which marked the quincentenary of  Columbus’s first voyages to the Americas, spawned an  enormous amount of discussion about the significance of  his voyages. Journalists, scholars, amateurs, and polemicists  debated Columbus’s accomplishments and failures.  Until the 1980s most writers would have generally  agreed with Harvard historian Samuel Eliot Morison in  his 1942 biography of the explorer: "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The whole history of the Americas stems from the Four Voyages  of Columbus; today a score of independent nations and  dominions unite in homage to Columbus, the stout-hearted  son of Genoa, who carried Christian civilization across the  Ocean Sea.17 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In 1942, the Western Powers believed they were engaged  in a life-and-death struggle to defend “Christian civilization  against the evil of fascism. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In contrast to this lavish praise, Columbus has recently  been severely criticized. He enslaved and sometimes killed  the Indians he encountered. He was a cruel and ineffective  governor of Spain’s Caribbean colony. Moreover, he  did not discover the Americas: Native Americans had occupied  the New World for millennia before Columbus,  and other Europeans, including the Vikings, had been  there before him. Not only did he not discover the continents,  but he also misunderstood what he found. Other  writers have faulted Columbus as an opportunistic adventurer  who originated European exploitation of the  non-European world. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Rather than judging Columbus by debates and standards  of our time, it is more important to put him into  the context of his own time. First, what kind of man was  Columbus, and what forces or influences shaped him?  Second, in sailing westward from Europe, what were his  goals? Third, did he achieve his goals, and what did he  make of his discoveries? "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Columbus grew up in Genoa and thus drew on the  centuries-old tradition of Genoese participation in international  trade. In his dream of a westward passage to  the Indies, he embodied a long-standing Genoese ambition  to circumvent Venetian domination of eastward  trade, which was now being claimed by the Portuguese.  Columbus was also very knowledgeable about the sea.  He had worked as a mapmaker, and he was familiar with  such fifteenth-century Portuguese navigational developments  as portolans—written descriptions of the courses  along which ships sailed, showing bays, coves, capes,  ports, and the distances between these places—and the  use of the magnetic needle as a nautical instrument. As  he implied in his Journal, he had acquired not only theoretical  but also practical experience: “I have spent twenty- three years at sea and have not left it for any length of  time worth mentioning, and I have seen everything from  east to west [meaning he had been to England] and I  have been to Guinea [north and west Africa].18 Although  some of Columbus’s geographical information,  such as his measurement of the distance from Portugal to  Japan as 2,760 miles when it is actually 12,000, proved  inaccurate, his successful thirty-three-day voyage to the  Caribbean owed a great deal to his seamanship. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Columbus was also a deeply religious man. He began  the Journal of his voyage to the Americas in the form of  a letter to Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain: "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" On 2 January in the year 1492, when your Highnesses had  concluded their war with the Moors who reigned in Europe,  I saw your Highnesses’ banners victoriously raised on the  towers of the Alhambra, the citadel of the city, and the Moor"}

And later in that same  month, on the grounds of information I had given your Highnesses  concerning the lands of India...your Highnesses  decided to send me, Christopher Columbus, to see these  parts of India and the princes and peoples of those lands and  consider the best means for their conversion.19 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Columbus had witnessed the Spanish reconquest of  Granada and shared fully in the religious and nationalistic  fervor surrounding that event. Like the Spanish rulers  and most Europeans of his age, Columbus understood  Christianity as a missionary religion that should be carried  to places and peoples where it did not exist. Although  Columbus certainly had material and secular  goals, first and foremost, as he wrote in 1498, he believed  he was a divine agent: “God made me the messenger  of the new heaven and the new earth of which he  spoke in the Apocalypse of St. John . . . and he showed  me the post where to find it.20 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What was the object of this first voyage? Columbus  gave the answer in the very title of the expedition, “The  Enterprise of the Indies. He wanted to find a direct  ocean trading route to Asia. Rejected by the Portuguese  in 1483 and by Ferdinand and Isabella in 1486, the project  finally won the backing of the Spanish monarchy in  1492. The Santa Fe capitulations named Columbus  viceroy over any territory he might discover and gave  him one-tenth of the material rewards of the journey. Inspired  by the stories of Marco Polo, Columbus dreamed  of reaching the court of the Great Khan (not realizing  that the Ming Dynasty had overthrown the Mongols in  1368). Based on Ptolemy’s Geography and other texts,  he expected to pass the islands of Japan and then land on  the east coast of China. He carried letters from Ferdinand  and Isabella to the khan and an Arabic interpreter,  for he assumed that the Great Khan must be in dialogue  with Arabic-speaking powers. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" How did Columbus interpret what he had found, and  in his mind did he achieve what he had set out to do?  Columbus’s small fleet left the seaport of Palos on August  3 bound for a first stop at the Canary Islands, the  westernmost outpost of European civilization. He landed  in the Bahamas on October 12, which he christened San  Salvador. Columbus believed he had found some small  islands off the east coast of Cipangu (Japan). On encountering  natives of the islands, he gave them some  beads and “many other trifles of small value, pronouncing  them delighted with these gifts and eager to trade. In  a letter he wrote to Ferdinand and Isabella on his return "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The European Voyages of Discovery • 499 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" to Spain, Columbus described the natives as handsome,  peaceful, and primitive people whose body painting reminded  him of the Canary Islands natives. He concluded  that they would make good slaves and could quickly be  converted to Christianity. (See the feature “Listening to  the Past: Columbus Describes His First Voyage on  pages 518–519.) "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Columbus received reassuring reports—via hand gestures  and mime—of the presence of gold and of a great  king in the vicinity. From San Salvador, Columbus sailed  southwest, believing that this course would take him to  Japan or the coast of China. He landed on Cuba on October  28. Deciding that he must be on the mainland near  the coastal city of Quinsay (Hangzhou), he sent a small  embassy inland with letters from Ferdinand and Isabella  and instructions to locate the grand city. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The landing party, however, found only sparsely populated  villages. In response to this disappointment,  Columbus set a course that is still controversial among  historians. Instead of continuing north, he turned southwest,  apparently giving up on his aim to meet the Great  Khan in preference to trying to find gold among the  peoples he had discovered. In January, having failed to  find the source of gold but having made contact with natives  seemingly apt for Christianization and confident of  the existence of gold somewhere in the vicinity, he  headed back to Spain. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Over the next decades, Columbus’s change of course  was reconfirmed as the Spanish adopted the model of  conquest and colonization they had already introduced  in the Canary Islands rather than one of exchange with  equals (as envisaged for the Mongol khan). On his second  voyage, Columbus forcibly subjugated the island of  Hispaniola, enslaved its indigenous peoples, and laid the  basis for a system of land grants tied to their labor service.  Columbus himself, however, had little interest in or  capacity for governing. Revolt soon broke out against  him and his brother on Hispaniola. A royal expedition  sent to investigate returned the brothers to Spain in  chains. Columbus was quickly cleared of wrongdoing,  but he did not recover his authority over the territories.  Instead, they came under royal control. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Columbus was very much a man of his times. To the  end of his life in 1506, he believed that he had found  small islands off the coast of Asia. He never realized the  scope of his achievement: to have found a vast continent  unknown to Europeans, except for a fleeting Viking presence  centuries earlier. He could not know that the scale  of his discoveries would revolutionize world power, raising  issues of trade, settlement, government bureaucracy,  and the rights of native and African peoples. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Later Explorers "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" News of Columbus’s first voyage rapidly spread across  Europe. On April 1, 1493, a printer in Barcelona published  Columbus’s letter to Ferdinand and Isabella describing  what he had found. By the end of that month  the letter had been translated into Latin and published in  Rome. Within a year printers in Paris, Basel, Antwerp,  and Venice had brought out six more Latin editions,  which were soon followed by translations into other European  languages. In a 1503 letter Florentine navigator  Amerigo Vespucci (1454–1512) wrote about his discoveries  on the coast of modern-day Venezuela, stating:  “Those new regions which we found and explored with  the fleet . . . we may rightly call a New World. This letter,  titled Mundus Novus (The New World), was the first  document to describe America as a continent separate  from Asia. In recognition of Amerigo’s bold claim, the  continent was named for him. (When later cartographers  realized that Columbus had made the discovery first, it  was too late to change the maps.) "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" To settle competing claims to the Atlantic discoveries,  Spain and Portugal turned to Pope Alexander VI. The  Treaty of Tordesillas (1494) gave Spain everything to  the west of an imaginary line drawn down the Atlantic  and Portugal everything to the east. This arbitrary division  worked in Portugal’s favor when in 1500 an expedition  led by Pedro Alvares Cabral landed on the coast of "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Brazil, which Cabral claimed as Portuguese territory. The  country’s name derives from the brazilwood trees found  there, an important source of red dye (from the word  brasa, or the reddish color of burning coals). "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The search for profits determined the direction of  Spanish exploration and expansion into South America.  When it became apparent that placer mining (in which  ore is separated from soil by panning) in the Caribbean  islands was unrewarding and that the Portuguese were  reaping enormous riches in Asian trade, new routes to  the East and new sources of gold and silver were sought.  In 1519 the Spanish ruler Charles V commissioned the  Portuguese mariner Ferdinand Magellan (1480–1521)  to find a direct route to the spices of the Moluccas off the  southeast coast of Asia. Magellan sailed southwest across  the Atlantic to Brazil, and after a long search along the  coast he located the treacherous straits that now bear his  name (see Map 15.2). The new ocean he sailed into after  a rough passage through the straits seemed so peaceful  that Magellan dubbed it the Pacific. He was soon to realize  his mistake. His fleet sailed north up the west coast of  South America and then headed west into the immense  expanse of the Pacific toward the Malay Archipelago.  (Some of these islands were conquered in the 1560s and  named the “Philippines for Philip II of Spain.) "}

The trip across  the Pacific took ninety-eight days, and the men survived  on rats and sawdust. Magellan himself was killed in a skirmish  in the Philippines. The expedition had enough survivors  to man only two ships, and one of them was  captured by the Portuguese. One ship with eighteen men  returned to Spain from the east by way of the Indian  Ocean, the Cape of Good Hope, and the Atlantic in  1522. The voyage had taken almost exactly three years. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Despite the losses, this voyage revolutionized Europeans’  understanding of the world by demonstrating the  vastness of the Pacific. The earth was clearly much larger  than Columbus had believed. The voyage actually made  a small profit in spices, but Magellan had proved the  westward passage to the Indies to be too long and dangerous  for commercial purposes. Turning to its New  World colonies, Spain abandoned the attempt to oust  Portugal from the Eastern spice trade. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Resounding success in this arena belonged to the  Dutch. By the end of the sixteenth century Amsterdam  had overtaken Antwerp as the financial capital of Europe.  The Dutch had also embarked on foreign exploration  and conquest. The Dutch East India Company, founded  in 1602, became the major organ of Dutch imperialism  and within a few decades expelled the Portuguese from  Ceylon and other East Indian islands. By 1650 the Dutch  West India Company had successfully intruded on the  Spanish possessions in the Americas, in the process gaining  control of much of the African and American trade. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" English and French explorations lacked the immediate,  sensational results of those of the Spanish and Portuguese.  In 1497 John Cabot, a Genoese merchant living  in London, sailed for Brazil but discovered Newfoundland.  The next year he returned and explored the New  England coast, perhaps going as far south as Delaware.  Since these expeditions found no spices or gold, Henry  VII lost interest in exploration.

In November  he entered Tenochtitlán (now Mexico City),  capital of the sophisticated Aztec Empire ruled by Montezuma  II (r. 1502–1520). Larger than any European  city of the time, the capital was the heart of a civilization  with advanced mathematics, astronomy, and engineering,  with a complex social system, and with oral poetry and  historical traditions. In less than two years Cortés had  destroyed the monarchy, gained complete control of the  capital city, and extended his jurisdiction over much of  the Aztec Empire. Why did a strong people defending  its own territory succumb to a handful of Spaniards fighting  in dangerous and unfamiliar circumstances? Scholars  continue to debate this question. The best answer is that,  at the time of the Spanish arrival, the Aztec Empire faced  internal weaknesses brought on by the resentment of recently  subjugated tribes and by the Aztecs’ own psychology  and attitudes toward war. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" The Spaniards arrived in late summer, when the Aztecs  were preoccupied with harvesting their crops and not  thinking of war. From the Spaniards’ perspective, the  timing was ideal. A series of natural phenomena, signs,  and portents seemed to augur disaster for the Aztecs. A  comet was seen in daytime, and two temples were suddenly  destroyed, one by lightning unaccompanied by  thunder. These and other apparently inexplicable events  had an unnerving and demoralizing effect on the Aztecs. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Even more important was the alienation of newly conquered  tribes and the Aztecs’ failure to provide an effective  military resistance. The Aztec state religion, the  sacred cult of Huitzilopochtli, necessitated constant warfare  against neighboring peoples to secure captives for  religious sacrifice and laborers for agricultural and infrastructural  work. When Cortés landed, recently defeated  tribes were not yet fully integrated into the empire. Increases  in tribute provoked revolt, which led to reconquest,  retribution, and demands for higher tribute, which  in turn sparked greater resentment and fresh revolt. When  the Spaniards appeared, the Totonacs greeted them as  liberators, and other subject peoples joined them against  the Aztecs.21 "}

There are bridges, very  large, strong, and well constructed, so that, over many, ten horsemen can ride abreast. . . . The city has  many squares where markets are held. . . . There is one square, twice as large as that of Salamanca, all  surrounded by arcades, where there are daily more than sixty thousand souls, buying and selling.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Spanish Settlement and Indigenous  Population Decline "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the sixteenth century perhaps two hundred thousand  Spaniards immigrated to the New World. Mostly soldiers  demobilized from the Spanish and Italian campaigns and  adventurers and drifters unable to find employment in  Spain, they did not come to work. After assisting in the  conquest of the Aztecs and the subjugation of the Incas,  these drifters wanted to settle down and become a ruling  class. They carved out vast estates in temperate grazing  areas and imported Spanish sheep, cattle, and horses for  the kinds of ranching with which they were familiar. In  coastal tropic areas unsuited for grazing the Spanish  erected huge sugar plantations. Columbus had introduced  sugar into the West Indies; Cortés had introduced "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" it into Mexico. Sugar was a great luxury in Europe, and  demand was high. Around 1550 the discovery of silver  at Zacatecas and Guanajuato in Mexico and Potosí in  present-day Bolivia stimulated silver rushes. How were  the cattle ranches, sugar plantations, and silver mines to  be worked? Obviously, by the Amerindians. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Spanish quickly established the encomienda system.  The Crown granted the conquerors the right to  employ groups of Amerindians as agricultural or mining  laborers or as tribute payers. Theoretically, the Spanish  were forbidden to enslave the natives; in actuality, the  encomiendas were a legalized form of slavery. The European  demand for sugar, tobacco, and silver prompted the  colonists to exploit the Amerindians mercilessly. Unaccustomed  to forced labor, especially in the blistering heat  of tropical cane fields or in the dark, dank, and dangerous  mines, they died in staggering numbers. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Students of the history of medicine have suggested  another crucial explanation for indigenous population  losses: disease. Contact with disease builds up bodily resistance;  peoples isolated from other societies are not exposed  to some diseases and thus do not build resistance.  At the beginning of the sixteenth century Amerindians  probably had the unfortunate distinction of longer isolation  from the rest of humankind than any other people  on earth. Crowded concentrations of laborers in the  mining camps bred infection, which the miners carried to  their home villages. Having little or no resistance to diseases  brought from the Old World, the inhabitants of the  highlands of Mexico and Peru, especially, fell victim to  smallpox, typhus, influenza, and other diseases. According  to one expert, smallpox caused “in all likelihood the  most severe single loss of aboriginal population that ever  occurred.23 (The old belief that syphilis was a New  World disease imported to Europe by Columbus’s sailors  has been discredited by the discovery of pre-Columbian  skeletons in Europe bearing signs of the disease.) "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Although disease was the most important cause of  indigenous population decline, there were many others.  With the native population diverted from traditional  agricultural work, cultivation of crops suffered, leading  to malnutrition, reduced fertility rates, and starvation.  Women forced to work were separated from their infants,  leading to high infant mortality rates in a population with  no livestock to supply alternatives to breast milk. Malnutrition  and hunger in turn reduced resistance to disease. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Many indigenous peoples died through outright violence. 24 According to the Franciscan missionary Bartolomé  de Las Casas (1474–1566), the Spanish maliciously  murdered thousands: "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \f This infinite multitude of people [the Indians] was... without  fraud, without subtilty or malice...toward the Spaniards  whom they serve, patient, meek and peaceful.... "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" To these quiet Lambs... came the Spaniards like most  c(r)uel Tygres, Wolves and Lions, enrag’d with a sharp and  tedious hunger; for these forty years past, minding nothing  else but the slaughter of these unfortunate wretches, whom  with divers kinds of torments neither seen nor heard of before,  they have so cruelly and inhumanely butchered, that  of three millions of people which Hispaniola itself did contain,  there are left remaining alive scarce three hundred  persons.25 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Las Casas’s remarks concentrate on the tropical lowlands,  but the death rate in the highlands was also overwhelming. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Franciscan, Dominican, and Jesuit missionaries  who accompanied the conquistadors and settlers played  an important role in converting the Amerindians to  Christianity, teaching them European methods of agriculture,  and inculcating loyalty to the Spanish crown. In  terms of numbers of people baptized, missionaries enjoyed  phenomenal success, though the depth of the  Amerindians’ understanding of Christianity remains debatable.  Missionaries, especially Las Casas, asserted that  the Amerindians had human rights, and through Las  Casas’s persistent pressure the emperor Charles V abolished  the worst abuses of the encomienda system in 1531. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For colonial administrators the main problem posed by  the astronomically high death rate was the loss of a subjugated  labor force. As early as 1511 King Ferdinand of  Spain observed that the Amerindians seemed to be “very  frail and that “one black could do the work of four Indians. 26 Thus was born an absurd myth and the new  tragedy of the Atlantic slave trade. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Sugar and Slavery "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Throughout the Middle Ages slavery was deeply entrenched  in the Mediterranean. The bubonic plague,  famines, and other epidemics created a severe shortage of  agricultural and domestic workers throughout Europe,  encouraging Italian merchants to buy slaves from the  Balkans, Thrace, southern Russia, and central Anatolia.  During the Renaissance the slave trade represented an  important aspect of Italian business enterprise: where  profits were high, papal threats of excommunication  failed to stop slave traders. The Genoese set up colonial  stations in the Crimea and along the Black Sea, and according  to an international authority on slavery, these  outposts were “virtual laboratories for the development "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Europe and the World After Columbus • 505 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" of slave plantation agriculture in the New World.27 This  form of slavery had nothing to do with race; almost all  slaves were white. How, then, did black African slavery  enter the European picture and take root in South and  then North America? "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In 1453 the Ottoman capture of Constantinople  halted the flow of white slaves from the Black Sea region  and the Balkans. Mediterranean Europe, cut off from its  traditional source of slaves, then turned to sub-Saharan  Africa, which had a long history of slave trading. The  centuries-old trans-Saharan trade was greatly stimulated  by the existence of a ready market for slaves in the vineyards  and sugar plantations of Sicily and Majorca. (See  the feature “Individuals in Society: Juan de Pareja.) "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Native to the South Pacific, sugar was taken in ancient  times to India, where farmers learned to preserve cane  juice as granules that could be stored and shipped. From  there, sugar traveled to China and the Mediterranean,  where islands like Crete, Sicily, and Cyprus had the necessary  warm and wet climate. When Genoese and other  Italians colonized the Canary Islands and the Portuguese  settled on the Madeira Islands, sugar plantations came  to the Atlantic. In this stage of European expansion, “the  history of slavery became inextricably tied up with the  history of sugar.28 Originally sugar was an expensive  luxury that only the very affluent could afford, but population  increases and monetary expansion in the fifteenth  century led to an increasing demand for it. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Resourceful Italians provided the capital, cane, and  technology for sugar cultivation on plantations in southern  Portugal, Madeira, and the Canary Islands. Meanwhile,  in the period 1490 to 1530, Portuguese traders  brought between three hundred and two thousand black  slaves to Lisbon each year (see Map 15.3), where they  performed most of the manual labor and constituted 10  percent of the city’s population. From there slaves were  transported to the sugar plantations of Madeira, the  Azores, and the Cape Verde Islands. Sugar and the small  Atlantic islands gave New World slavery its distinctive  shape. Columbus himself, who spent a decade in Madeira,  brought sugar plants on his voyages to “the Indies. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Pareja was born in Antequera, an agricultural region  and the old center of Muslim culture near Seville  in southern Spain. Of his parents we know nothing.  Because a rare surviving document calls him a “mulatto,  one of his parents must have been white and the  other must have had some African blood. The Spanish  word mulatto derives from the Arabic muwallad, a  person of mixed race, and some scholars, using religion  to describe ethnic category, speak of Pareja’s “Muslim  descent.

{"prompt":"","completion":" In 1630 Pareja applied to the mayor of Seville for  permission to travel to Madrid to visit his brother and  “to perfect his art. The document lists his occupation  as “a painter in Seville. Since it mentions no other  name, it is reasonable to assume that Pareja arrived in  Madrid a free man. Sometime between 1630 and 1648,  however, he came into the possession of the artist  Diego Velázquez (1599–1660); Pareja became a slave. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the twelfth century Muslim slaves helped build  the cathedral of Saint James at Santiago de Compostela,  one of the great shrines of medieval Christendom.  During the long wars of the reconquista, Muslims and  Christians captured each other in battle and used the  defeated as slaves. The fifteenth and sixteenth centuries  had seen a steady flow of sub-Saharan Africans into the  Iberian Peninsula. Thus early modern Spain was a  slaveholding society. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" How did Velázquez acquire Pareja? By purchase?  As a gift? Had Pareja fallen into debt or committed  some crime and thereby lost his freedom? We do not  know. Velázquez, the greatest Spanish painter of the  seventeenth century, had a large studio with many  assistants. Pareja was set to grinding powders to  make colors and to preparing canvases. He must have  demonstrated ability because, when Velázquez went to  Rome in 1648, he chose Pareja to accompany him. "}

After living in Seville and Madrid, he traveled  widely, visiting Genoa, Venice, Rome, and Naples.  Travel may have broadened him, producing a cosmopolitan  man. Pareja’s career suggests that a person of  talent and ability could rise in Spanish society despite  the social and religious barriers that existed at the time.  Jonathan Brown, the leading authority on Velázquez,  describes Pareja’s appearance in Velázquez’s portrait as  “self-confident. A more enthusiastic student writes,  “The Metropolitan is probably the greatest museum in  the world . . . and this [Velázquez’s portrait of Pareja]  is its greatest painting. . . . The man was technically a  slave.... However, we can see from Velázquez’s painting  that the two were undeniably equals.

The  Portuguese brought the first slaves to Brazil; by 1600  four thousand were being imported annually. After its  founding in 1621, the Dutch West India Company, with  the full support of the government of the United  Provinces, transported thousands of Africans to Brazil  and the Caribbean. In the late seventeenth century, with  the chartering of the Royal African Company, the English  got involved. Altogether, traders from all these countries  brought an estimated ten million African slaves to  the Americas from 1650 to 1870. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" European sailors found the Atlantic passage cramped  and uncomfortable, but conditions for African slaves  were lethal.

Spanish  and Portuguese immigrants to the Americas wanted "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \f the lifestyle and diet with which they were familiar. Foods  that Iberian settlers considered essential—wheat for  bread, grapes for wine, olive oil for both culinary and  sacramental purposes—were not grown in America. So  the migrants sought to turn the New World into the Old:  they searched for climatic zones favorable to those crops.  Everywhere they settled they raised wheat—in the highlands  of Mexico, the Rio de la Plata, New Granada (in  northern South America), and Chile. By 1535 Mexico  was exporting wheat. Grapes did well in parts of Peru  and Chile. It took the Spanish longer to discover areas  where suitable soil and adequate rainfall would nourish  olive trees, but by the 1560s the coastal valleys of Peru  and Chile were dotted with olive groves. Columbus had  brought sugar plants on his second voyage; Spaniards  also introduced rice and bananas from the Canary Islands,  and the Portuguese carried these items to Brazil.  All nonindigenous plants and trees had to be brought  from Europe, but not all plants arrived intentionally. In  clumps of mud on shoes and in the folds of textiles came  immigrant grasses such as Kentucky bluegrass, daisies,  and the common dandelion. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Apart from wild turkeys and game, Native Americans  had no animals for food; apart from alpacas and llamas,  they had no animals for travel or to use as beasts of burden.  (Human power had moved the huge stones needed  to build the monumental Aztec temples.) On his second  voyage in 1493 Columbus introduced horses, cattle,  sheep, dogs, pigs, chickens, and goats. The multiplication  of these animals proved spectacular. By the 1550s,  when the Spaniards explored, they brought along herds  of swine. The horse enabled the Spanish conquerors and  the Amerindians to travel faster and farther and to transport  heavy loads. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In return, the Spanish and Portuguese took back to  Europe the main American cereal, maize (corn), from  Mexico; white potatoes from Peru; and many varieties  of beans, squash, pumpkins, avocados, and tomatoes  (which Europeans distrusted, fearing that they were sexually  stimulating). Maize was the great gift of the Amerindians  to all the peoples of the world as food for humans  and livestock. Because maize grows in climates too dry  for rice and too wet for wheat, gives a high yield per unit  of land, and has a short growing season, it proved an  especially important crop for Europeans. Initially they  looked on the white potato with contempt, but they  gradually recognized its nutritional value.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Silver and the Economic Effects  of Spain’s Discoveries "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The sixteenth century has often been called Spain’s  golden century, but silver was far more important than  gold. The influence of Spanish armies, Spanish Catholicism,  and Spanish wealth was felt all over Europe. This  greatness rested largely on the influx of silver from the  Americas. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In 1545, at an altitude of fifteen thousand feet where  nothing grew because of the cold, and after a two-and-ahalf- month journey by pack animal from Lima, Peru, the  Spanish discovered an incredible source of silver at Potosí  (in present-day Bolivia) in territory conquered from the  Inca Empire. The place had no population. By 1600,  160,000 people lived there, making it about the size of  the city of London. In the second half of the sixteenth  century Potosí yielded perhaps 60 percent of all the silver  mined in the world. From Potosí and the mines at Zacatecas  and Guanajuato in Mexico, huge quantities of  precious metals poured forth. To protect this treasure  from French and English pirates, armed convoys transported  it to Spain each year. Between 1503 and 1650, 16  million kilograms of silver and 185,000 kilograms of  gold entered Seville’s port. Spanish predominance, however,  proved temporary. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the sixteenth century Spain experienced a steady  population increase, creating a sharp rise in the demand  for food and goods. Spanish colonies in the Americas also  represented a demand for products. Since Spain had expelled  some of its best farmers and businessmen—the  Muslims and Jews—in the fifteenth century, the Spanish  economy was suffering and could not meet the new demands,  and prices rose. Because the cost of manufacturing  cloth and other goods increased, Spanish products  could not compete with cheaper products made elsewhere  in the international market. The textile industry  was badly hurt. Prices spiraled upward faster than the  government could levy taxes to dampen the economy.  (Higher taxes would have cut the public’s buying power;  with fewer goods sold, prices would have come down.) "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Did the flood of silver bullion from America cause the  inflation? Prices rose most steeply before 1565, but bullion  imports reached their peak between 1580 and 1620.  Thus there is no direct correlation between silver imports  and the inflation rate. Did the substantial population "}

One fact is certain: the price revolution  severely strained government budgets. Several times  between 1557 and 1647, Spain’s King Philip II and his  successors repudiated the state debt, thereby undermining  confidence in the government and leaving the economy  in shambles. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As Philip II paid his armies and foreign debts with silver  bullion, Spanish inflation was transmitted to the rest  of Europe. Between 1560 and 1600 much of Europe  experienced large price increases. Prices doubled and in  some cases quadrupled. Spain suffered most severely,  but all European countries were affected. Because money  bought less, people who lived on fixed incomes, such  as the continental nobles, were badly hurt. Those who  owed fixed sums of money, such as the middle class, prospered:  in a time of rising prices, debts had less value each  year. Food costs rose most sharply, and the poor fared  worst of all. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In many ways, it was not Spain but China that controlled  the world trade in silver. The Chinese demanded  silver for its products and for the payment of imperial  taxes. China was thus the main buyer of world silver,  serving as a “sink for half the world’s production of silver.  Just as China was the heart of world trade, so was it,  not Europe, the center of the early modern bullion trade.  The silver market drove world trade, with the Americas  and Japan being mainstays on the supply side and China  dominating the demand side. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Birth of the Global Economy "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With the Europeans’ discovery of the Americas and their  exploration of the Pacific, the entire world was linked for  the first time in history by seaborne trade. That trade  brought into being three successive commercial empires:  the Portuguese, the Spanish, and the Dutch. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the sixteenth century naval power and shipborne  artillery gave Portugal hegemony over the sea route to  India. To Lisbon the Portuguese fleet brought spices,  which the Portuguese paid for with textiles produced at  Gujarat and Coromandel in India and with gold and  ivory from East Africa (see Map 15.3). From their fortified  bases at Goa on the Arabian Sea and at Malacca on  the Malay Peninsula, ships of Malabar teak carried goods  to the Portuguese settlement at Macao in the South  China Sea. From Macao Portuguese ships loaded with  Chinese silks and porcelains sailed to the Japanese port  of Nagasaki and to the Philippine port of Manila, where  Chinese goods were exchanged for Spanish (that is, Latin "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" American) silver. Throughout Asia the Portuguese traded  in slaves—black Africans, Chinese, and Japanese. The  Portuguese exported to India horses from Mesopotamia  and copper from Arabia; from India they exported hawks  and peacocks for the Chinese and Japanese markets. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Across the Atlantic Portuguese Brazil provided most  of the sugar consumed in Europe in the sixteenth and  early seventeenth centuries. African slave labor produced  the sugar on the plantations of Brazil, and Portuguese  merchants controlled both the slave trade between West  Africa and Brazil and the commerce in sugar between  Brazil and Portugal. The Portuguese were the first worldwide  traders, and Portuguese was the language of the  Asian maritime trade. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Spanish possessions in the New World constituted basically  a land empire, and in the sixteenth century the  Spaniards devised a method of governing that empire  (see page 538). But across the Pacific the Spaniards also  built a seaborne empire centered at Manila in the Philippines,  which had been “discovered by Ferdinand Magellan  in 1521. Between 1564 and 1571 the Spanish  navigator Miguel Lopez de Legazpi sailed from Mexico  and through a swift and almost bloodless conquest took  over the Philippine Islands. The city of Manila henceforth  served as the transpacific bridge between Spanish  America and the extreme Eastern trade. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Chinese silk, sold by the Portuguese in Manila for  American silver, was transported to Acapulco in Mexico,  and from there it was carried overland to Vera Cruz for  re-export to Spain. Because hostile Pacific winds prohibited  direct passage from the Philippines to Peru, large  shipments of silk also went south from Acapulco to Peru  (see Map 15.3). Spanish merchants could never satisfy  the European demand for silk, so huge amounts of bullion  went from Acapulco to Manila. In 1597, for example,  12 million pesos of silver, almost the total value of  the transatlantic trade, crossed the Pacific. After about  1640 the Spanish silk trade declined because it could not  compete with Dutch imports. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Stimulated by a large demand for goods in Europe,  India, China, and Japan, a worldwide commercial boom  occurred from about 1570 to 1630. Many people  throughout the world profited: capitalists who advanced  money for voyages, captains and crews of ships, and port  officials. As spices moved westward or northward, as silks  and porcelains moved southward and westward, and as  cloth moved eastward and westward, these various goods  grew more valuable in the boom of long-distance trade.31 "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" The Dutch fleet, sailing from the Cape of Good Hope  and avoiding the Portuguese forts in India, steered directly  for the Sunda Strait in Indonesia (see Map 15.3).  The Dutch wanted direct access to and control of the  Indonesian sources of spices. In return for assisting Indonesian  princes in local squabbles and disputes with  the Portuguese, the Dutch won broad commercial concessions.  Through agreements, seizures, and outright  war, they gained control of the western access to the Indonesian  archipelago. Gradually, they acquired political  domination over the archipelago itself.

He had  also devoted enormous energy to a futile attempt to  stamp out the burgeoning Protestant Reformation. (It  was he who summoned Martin Luther to the Diet of  Worms.) Charles abdicated the Spanish crown and the  Netherlands to his son Philip II of Spain and Austria, and  other territories in central Europe and the title of Holy  Roman emperor to his brother Ferdinand. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Philip inherited his father’s overseas Spanish Empire as  well as the cascade of silver now flowing from the Americas.  In today’s world we might view the birth of globalization  as a monumental turning point; Philip, however,  was more concerned with religious rivalries in Europe.  Traditional scholarship has depicted Philip as morose and  melancholic, a religious bigot determined to re-impose  Roman Catholicism on northern Europe. Recent research  portrays him as a more complicated figure. In his youth,  “he had visited northern Italy, the Alps, southern Germany,  the Rhineland, the Netherlands, parts of France,  and southern England.32 He had walked the streets  of Antwerp, Augsburg, Brussels, Cologne, London, and  Trent. With the exception of his father, no other European  ruler of the time had traveled or seen so much or  had accumulated so much political experience in international  relations. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" After Philip buried his fourth wife, Anna of Austria,  to whom he had been deeply devoted, contemporaries  noticed a more marked devotion to religion. He relied  more and more on God for political help. On the issues  of the Inquisition and religious toleration, Philip was  completely inflexible. He identified toleration with the  growth of heresy, civil disorder, violence, and bloodshed:  “Had there been no inquisition (in Spain) there would "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" have been more heretics, and the country would be in a  lamentable state like others (the Netherlands) where  there is no inquisition as we have in Spain.33 In this respect,  Philip II differed little from the Protestant reformers  Luther and Calvin, who initially called for individual  liberty of conscience and then insisted on the right of  church and civil powers to extirpate heresy within their  jurisdictions. Philip was a man of his times, and the times  did not favor religious toleration. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With his determination to crush heresy in the Low  Countries and with the enormous wealth of American  silver enabling him to hire the mercenary armies he  needed, why did Philip II have such trouble achieving his  goal? Philip was preoccupied with other parts of his vast  empire, especially the advance of the Ottoman Turks into  the western Mediterranean. This issue—combined with  the death of his son and heir Don Carlos and then a revolt  of the Moriscos (Muslims) in Granada—made it impossible  to concentrate on the Netherlands. At one point  in 1566 he complained, “I have so much on my mind  that I rarely know what I am doing or saying. Only after  Philip learned of the death of Suleiman the Magnificent  did he feel able to focus on the Netherlands.34 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But the Netherlands could not be separated in Philip’s  mind from what he perceived as the “British problem.  In 1586 Mary, Queen of Scots, cousin and heir of Elizabeth  of England, became implicated in a plot to assassinate  Elizabeth. Hoping to reunite England with Catholic  Europe through Mary, Philip gave the conspiracy his full  backing. Mary was discovered and beheaded on February  18, 1587. News of her execution reached Philip in  mid-April. When Pope Sixtus V (1585–1590) learned of  Mary’s death on March 24 (the dates suggest the slowness  of communication in the late sixteenth century), he  promised to pay Philip one million gold ducats the moment  Spanish troops landed in England. Conquering England  promised the additional benefit of cutting off  financial support to the Dutch rebels. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As plans for a naval expedition to attack England proceeded  in 1587, two serious difficulties burdened the  king. First, he was so badly crippled by gout that he  could not sign documents and needed a cane to walk,  painfully. Second, official reports indicated that the Ottoman  Turks might seize the moment of preoccupation  with the Netherlands and England to attack Spain from  the Mediterranean. Philip prepared a vast fleet to sail  from Lisbon to Flanders, fight off Elizabeth’s navy if  it attacked, rendezvous with the duke of Parma, commander  of Spanish forces in the Netherlands, and escort  barges carrying Parma’s troops across the English  Channel. On May 9, 1588, la felícissima armada—“the "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" most fortunate fleet, as it was ironically called in official  documents—sailed from Lisbon harbor composed of  more than 130 vessels. The Spanish Armada met an  English fleet in the Channel. The English ships were  smaller, faster, and more maneuverable, and many of  them had greater firing power than their Spanish counterparts.  A combination of storms and squalls, spoiled  food and rank water, inadequate Spanish ammunition,  and, to a lesser extent, English fire ships that caused the  Spanish to scatter gave England the victory. The Armada  was defeated before it even reached the Netherlands. On  the journey home many Spanish ships went down around  Ireland; perhaps 65 managed to reach home ports. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The battle in the Channel has frequently been described  as one of the decisive battles in world history. In  fact, it had mixed consequences. Spain soon rebuilt its  navy, and after 1588 the quality of the Spanish fleet improved.  The destruction of the Spanish Armada did not  halt the flow of silver from the New World. More silver  reached Spain between 1588 and 1603 than in any other  fifteen-year period. The war between England and Spain  dragged on for years. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The defeat of the Spanish Armada was decisive, however,  in the sense that it prevented Philip II from reimposing  religious unity on western Europe by force.  He did not conquer England, and Elizabeth continued  her financial and military support of the Dutch. In the  Netherlands neither side gained significant territory. The  borders of 1581 tended to become permanent. In 1609  Philip III of Spain (r. 1598–1621) agreed to a truce, in effect  recognizing the independence of the United Provinces.  In seventeenth-century Spain memory of the loss of  the Spanish Armada contributed to a spirit of defeatism.  In England the victory contributed to a David and Goliath  legend that enhanced English national sentiment. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The age of religious wars and overseas expansion was  characterized by an extraordinary degree of intellectual  and artistic ferment. This effervescence can be seen in  the development of the essay as a distinct literary genre,  in other prose, in poetry, in drama, in art, and in music.  In many ways, literature, the visual arts, music, and the  drama of the period mirrored the social and cultural conditions  that gave rise to them. An important theme running  through the culture of this time was the encounter  with radically new places and peoples. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" • How did culture and art in this period respond to social  and cultural transformation?  New Ideas About Race "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Ancient Greeks and Romans were in close contact with  Africa and they also practiced slavery, but they did not associate  one with the other. Slavery, which was endemic in  the ancient world, stemmed from either capture in war or  debt. Although generations could be born in captivity,  no particular ethnic or racial associations were involved  (see page 137). How did slavery come to be so closely associated  with race in the Age of Discovery? "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Settlers brought to the Americas the racial attitudes  they had absorbed in Europe. Their beliefs and attitudes  toward Africans derived from Christian theological speculation  and Arab ideas. In the sixteenth and seventeenth  centuries the English, for example, were extremely curious  about Africans’ lives and customs, and slavers’ accounts  were extraordinarily popular. Travel literature  depicted Africans as savages because of their eating  habits, morals, clothing, and social customs; as barbarians  because of their language and methods of war; and  as heathens because they were not Christian (nearly the  identical language with which the English described the  Irish—see page 398). Africans were believed to possess a  potent sexuality; African women were considered sexually  aggressive, with a “temper hot and lascivious.35 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “At the time when Columbus sailed to the New  World, Islam was the largest world religion, and the only  world religion that showed itself capable of expanding  rapidly in areas as far apart and as different from each  other as Senegal [in northwest Africa], Bosnia [in the  Balkans], Java, and the Philippines.36 Medieval Arabic  literature spoke of blacks’ physical repulsiveness, mental  inferiority, and primitivism. In contrast to civilized peoples  from the Mediterranean to China, some Arab writers  absurdly claimed, sub-Saharan blacks were the only peoples  who had produced no sciences or stable states.  Though black kings, the Muslim historian Ibn Khaldun  alleged, sold their subjects without even a pretext of  crime or war, the victims bore no resentment because  they gave no thought to the future and had “by nature  few cares and worries; dancing and rhythm are for them  inborn.37 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Medieval Christians and Arabs therefore had similar  notions of blacks as primitive people ideally suited to  enslavement. The racial biases that the Portuguese, Spanish,  Dutch, and English brought to the New World,  however, derived primarily from Christian theological  speculation. As Europeans turned to Africa for new  sources of slaves, they used ideas about Africans’ primitiveness  and barbarity to defend slavery and even argue  that enslavement benefited Africans by bringing the light "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Michel de Montaigne and  Cultural Curiosity "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Racism was not the only possible reaction to the new  worlds emerging in the sixteenth century. Decades of religious  fanaticism, bringing civil anarchy and war, led  both Catholics and Protestants to doubt that any one  faith contained absolute truth. Added to these doubts  was the discovery of peoples in the New World who had  radically different ways of life. These shocks helped produce  ideas of skepticism and cultural relativism in the  sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Skepticism is a school  of thought founded on doubt that total certainty or  definitive knowledge is ever attainable. The skeptic is  cautious and critical and suspends judgment. Cultural  relativism suggests that one culture is not necessarily superior  to another, just different. Both notions found expression  in the work of Frenchman Michel de Montaigne  (1533–1592). "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Montaigne descended from a bourgeois family that  had made a fortune selling salted herring and wine and in  1477 had purchased the title and property of Montaigne  in Gascony. His mother came from a Jewish family that  had been forced to flee Spain. Montaigne received a classical  education, studied law, and secured a judicial appointment  in 1554. He condemned the ancient nobility  for being more concerned with war and sports than with  the cultivation of the mind. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" At the age of thirty-eight Montaigne resigned his judicial  post, retired to his estate, and devoted the rest of his  life to study, contemplation, and an effort to understand  himself. His wealth provided him with the leisure time to  do so. A humanist, he believed that the object of life was  to “know thyself, for self-knowledge teaches men and  women how to live in accordance with nature and God.  Montaigne developed a new literary genre, the essay—  from the French essayer, meaning “to test or try—to express  his thoughts and ideas. "}

However, among the good men who follow that  side...we see many whom passion drives outside the  bounds of reason, and makes them sometimes adopt unjust,  violent, and even reckless courses.38 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Though he remained a Catholic, Montaigne possessed  detachment, independence, openness of mind, and the  willingness to look at all sides of a question. As he wrote,  “other people’s reasons can serve to support me, but seldom  to change my course. I listen to them all favorably  and decently; but so far as I can remember, I have never  up to this moment followed any but my own. I set little  value on my own opinion, but I set just as little on those  of others.39 "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Montaigne’s rejection of dogmatism, his secularism,  and his skepticism thus represented a basic change. In his  own time and throughout the seventeenth century, few  would have agreed with him. The publication of his  ideas, however, anticipated a basic shift in attitudes.  Montaigne inaugurated an era of doubt. “Wonder, he  said, “is the foundation of all philosophy, research is the  means of all learning, and ignorance is the end.41 "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" (r. 1603–1625), witnessed remarkable literary expression.  The terms Elizabethan and Jacobean (referring to  the reign of James) are used to designate the English music,  poetry, prose, and drama of this period. The poetry  of Sir Philip Sidney (1554–1586), such as Astrophel and  Stella, strongly influenced later poetic writing. The Faerie  Queene of Edmund Spenser (1552–1599) endures as one  of the greatest moral epics in any language. The rare poetic  beauty of the plays of Christopher Marlowe (1564–  1593), such as Tamburlaine and The Jew of Malta, paved  the way for the work of Shakespeare. Above all, the immortal  dramas of William Shakespeare (1564–1616) and  the stately prose of the Authorized, or King James, Bible  marked the Elizabethan and Jacobean periods as the  golden age of English literature.

Shakespeare was a Renaissance man in his deep appreciation  of classical culture, individualism, and humanism.  Such plays as Julius Caesar, Pericles, and Antony and  Cleopatra deal with classical subjects and figures. Several  of his comedies have Italian Renaissance settings. The  nine history plays, including Richard II, Richard III, and  Henry IV, enjoyed the greatest popularity among Shakespeare’s  contemporaries. Written during the decade after  the defeat of the Spanish Armada, the history plays express  English national consciousness. "}

After Caliban’s attempted rape of Miranda,  Prospero enslaves him, earning the rage and resentment  of his erstwhile pupil. Modern scholars often note the  echoes between this play and the realities of imperial conquest  and settlement in Shakespeare’s day. It is no accident,  they argue, that the poet portrayed Caliban as a  monstrous, dark-skinned island native whose natural condition  is servitude. The author himself borrows words  from Montaigne’s essay “On Cannibals, suggesting that  his portrayal may have implied criticism of superior colonial  attitudes rather than an unqualified endorsement.

Indian Ocean trade, long dominated  by Muslim merchants operating from autonomous city- ports, increasingly fell under the control of Portuguese  merchants sponsored by their Crown.

The resulting  Columbian exchange decimated native populations  and fostered exchange of a myriad of plant, animal, and  viral species.

{"prompt":"","completion":" • What were the common crises and achievements of  seventeenth-century states?  Economic and Demographic Crisis "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the seventeenth century the vast majority of western  Europeans lived in the countryside. The hub of the rural  world was the small peasant village centered on a church  and a manor. Life was in many ways circumscribed by the  village, although we should not underestimate the mobility  induced by war, food shortage, fortune-seeking,  and religious pilgrimage. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A small number of peasants in each village owned  enough land to feed themselves and the livestock and  ploughs necessary to work their land. These independent  farmers were leaders of the peasant village. They employed  the landless poor, rented out livestock and tools,  and served as agents for the noble lord. Below them were  small landowners and tenant farmers who did not have  enough land to be self-sufficient. These families sold  their best produce on the market to earn cash for taxes,  rent, and food. At the bottom were the rural proletariat  who worked as dependent laborers and servants. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Rich or poor, bread was the primary element of the  diet. Ignoring our modern health concerns, the richest  ate a white loaf, leaving brown bread to those who could  not afford better. Peasants paid stiff fees to the local miller  for grinding grain into flour and sometimes to the lord  for the right to bake bread in his oven. Bread was most often  accompanied with a soup made of roots, herbs, beans,  and perhaps a small piece of salt pork. One of the biggest "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" \f annual festivals in the rural village was the killing of the  family pig. The whole family gathered to help, sharing a  rare abundance of meat with neighbors and carefully salting  the extra and putting down the lard. In some areas,  menstruating women were careful to stay away from the  kitchen for fear they might cause the lard to spoil. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Rural society lived on the edge of subsistence. A bad  harvest, an illness, or a drop in prices could lead to debt  and the loss of one’s land. Because of the crude technology  and low crop yield, peasants were constantly threatened  by scarcity and famine. The fear of hunger marked  popular culture, and death was a familiar presence. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The seventeenth century put new stresses on this fragile  balance. A colder and wetter climate meant a shorter  farming season. Conditions were so bad that scholars refer  to this period as a “little ice age. A bad harvest created  dearth; a series of bad harvests could lead to famine.  Recurrent famines had a significant effect on the population  levels of early modern Europe. Using parish registers,  historians have traced the correspondence between  high prices on the one hand and burials and low birth  and marriage rates on the other. Most people did not die  of outright starvation, but rather of diseases brought on  by malnutrition and exhaustion. Facilitated by the weakened  population, outbreaks of bubonic plague continued  in Europe until the 1720s. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Industry also suffered. While the evidence does not  permit broad generalizations, it appears that the output  of woolen textiles, one of the most important European  manufactures, declined sharply in the first half of the century.  Food prices were high, wages stagnated, and unemployment  soared. This economic crisis was not universal:  it struck various regions at different times and to different  degrees. In the middle decades of the century, Spain,  France, Germany, and England all experienced great economic  difficulties; but these years were the golden age of  the Netherlands. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Peasants and the urban poor were the first to suffer  from bad harvests and economic depression. When the  price of bread rose beyond their capacity to pay, they frequently  took action. In towns they invaded the bakers’  shop to seize bread and resell it at a “just price. In rural  areas groups of peasants attacked convoys taking grain  away to the cities and also redistributed it for what they  considered a fair price. Women often took the lead in  these actions, since their role as mothers with children to  feed gave them some impunity in authorities’ eyes. Historians  have labeled this vision of a world in which community  needs predominate over competition and profit a  moral economy. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" In this context of economic and demographic depression,  monarchs began to make new demands on their people.  Traditionally, historians have distinguished sharply between  the “absolutist governments of France, Spain, central  Europe, and Russia and the constitutionally limited governments  of England and the Dutch Republic. Whereas absolutist  monarchs gathered all power under their personal  control, Dutch and English rulers were obliged to respect  laws passed by representative institutions. More recently,  historians have emphasized commonalities among these "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \f 526 CHAPTER 16 •  ABSOLUTISM AND CONSTITUTIONALISM IN WESTERN EUROPE, CA 1589–1715 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" powers. Despite their political differences, absolutist and  constitutional monarchs shared common projects of protecting  and expanding their frontiers, raising new taxes,  and consolidating state control. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Rulers who wished to increase their authority encountered  formidable obstacles. Some were purely material.  Without paved roads, telephones, or other modern  technology, it took weeks to convey orders from the  central government to the provinces. States like France  and Spain were vast, especially if we take their overseas  empires into account. Rulers also suffered from a lack of  information about their realms, due to the limited size  of their bureaucracies. Without accurate knowledge of  the number of inhabitants and the wealth they possessed,  it was impossible to police and tax the population  effectively. Cultural and linguistic differences presented  their own obstacles. Seventeenth-century Basques, Bretons,  Languedocians, and Alsatians spoke not French  but their own languages. These differences decreased  even further their willingness to obey a distant  monarch’s commands. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A more concrete obstacle was the array of privileged  groups who shared in authority and its spoils. The traditional  enemy of monarchical power was the nobility.  Across Europe, nobles retained great legal, military, political,  and financial powers, not to mention the traditional  social prestige they commanded. Nobles were not alone  in opposing monarchs’ new claims. Other competitors  included the church, the legislative corps, town councils,  guilds, and other bodies that had acquired autonomy  over the course of the Middle Ages. In some countries  whole provinces held separate privileges and exemptions  granted when they entered the kingdom. This special status  reinforced local power structures and identities. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A long historical consensus held that absolutist monarchs  succeeded in breaking the power of these institutions,  with Louis XIV of France serving as the model for  absolutist power across Europe. By contrast, mighty kings  were humbled in England and the Dutch Republic and  were forced to concede political power to elected representatives.  Today, historians paint a more nuanced picture  of this divide. On the one hand, they emphasize the  extent to which absolutist monarchs had to compromise  with existing power structures. Louis XIV succeeded because  he co-opted and convinced nobles, rather than by  crushing their power. On the other hand, historians also  recognize that traditional elites retained power in England  and the Netherlands. Constitutional limits did not  mean democracy, the rule of the people. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If we take a step back from the political differences, we  see that these states all succeeded—albeit to varying de"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" grees—in overcoming the obstacles and achieving new  levels of central control. Four achievements stand out  in particular: greater taxation, growth in armed forces,  larger and more efficient bureaucracies, and the increased  ability to compel obedience from their subjects. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Increasing the size and power of the state required  new sources of revenue. Medieval kings frequently found  temporary financial support through bargains with the  nobility: the nobility agreed to an ad hoc grant of money  in return for freedom from future taxation. Over the  course of the seventeenth century, rulers succeeded in  generating new levels of income by either forcing direct  taxes ever higher or devising alternative methods of raising  money. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Taxation both permitted and required a larger government  apparatus. This period witnessed the expansion  of government bureaucracies and the creation of administrative  techniques to improve communication and efficiency.  Bureaucracies were now composed of career  officials appointed by and solely accountable to the king.  The backgrounds of these civil servants varied. They  sometimes came from the middle classes, as in France,  the Netherlands, and England. In Spain and eastern Europe,  monarchs utilized members of the nobility instead  (see Chapter 17). "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Over time, government power added up to something  close to sovereignty. A state may be termed sovereign  when it possesses a monopoly over the instruments of  justice and the use of force within clearly defined boundaries.  In a sovereign state, no system of courts, such as ecclesiastical  tribunals, competes with state courts in the  dispensation of justice; and private armies, such as those  of feudal lords, present no threat to central authority because  the state’s army is stronger. State law touches all  persons in the country. While seventeenth-century states  did not acquire total sovereignty, they made important  strides toward that goal. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Warfare and the Growth of Army Size "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The driving force of seventeenth-century state-building  was warfare, characterized by dramatic changes in the size  and style of armies. Medieval armies had been raised by  feudal lords for particular wars or campaigns, after which  the troops were disbanded. In the seventeenth century  monarchs took command of recruiting and maintaining  armies—in peacetime as well as wartime. Kings deployed  their troops both inside and outside the country in the  interests of the monarchy. Instead of serving their own  interests, army officers were required to be loyal and obedient  to the monarchs who commanded them. New "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \f Seventeenth-Century Crisis and Rebuilding •  527 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" techniques for training and deploying soldiers meant a  rise in the professional standards of the army. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Along with professionalization came an explosive  growth in army size. The French took the lead, with the  army growing from roughly 125,000 men in the Thirty  Years’ War (1630–1648) to 250,000 during the Dutch  War (1672–1678) and 340,000 during the War of the  League of Augsburg (1688–1697).2 This growth was  caused in part by changes in the style of armies. Mustering  a royal army took longer than simply hiring a mercenary  band, giving enemies time to form coalitions. The  large coalitions Louis XIV confronted required him to  fight on multiple fronts with huge armies. In turn, the  relative size and wealth of France among European nations  allowed Louis to field enormous armies and thereby "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" to pursue the ambitious foreign policies that caused his  alarmed neighbors to form coalitions against him. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The death toll was startlingly high for noble officers,  who personally led their men in battle. The paramount  value of honor for noblemen outshone concerns for  safety or material benefit. Nobles had to purchase their  positions in the army and supply horses, food, uniforms,  and weapons for themselves and their troops. Royal  stipends did not begin to cover these expenses, and an officer’s  position could not be sold if he died in battle. The  only legacy an officer’s widow received was the debt incurred  to fund her husbands’ military career. It was not  until the 1760s that the French government assumed the  costs of equipping troops. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Other European powers were quick to follow the  French example. The rise of absolutism in  central and eastern Europe was similarly  marked by a vast expansion in the size of  armies (see Chapter 17). Great Britain followed  a similar, albeit distinctive pattern. Instead  of building a land army, the British  focused on naval forces and eventually built  the largest navy in the world. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Many historians believe that the new loyalty,  professionalism, and size of the French  army is the best case for the success of absolutism  under Louis XIV. Whatever his compromises  elsewhere, the French monarch had  firm control of his armed forces. As in so  many other matters, Louis’s model was followed  across Europe. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" In the seventeenth century increased pressures  of taxation and warfare turned bread riots  into armed uprisings. Popular revolts  were extremely common in England, France,  Spain, Portugal, and Italy in the mid-seventeenth  century.3 In 1640 Philip IV of Spain  faced revolt in Catalonia, the economic center  of his realm.

Not fooled by this change, local  women led a bread riot, shouting “Long live the king  and down with the taxes and the bad government! The  uprising spread to the rest of the island and eventually to  Naples on the mainland. Apart from affordable food,  rebels demanded the suppression of extraordinary taxes  and participation in municipal government. Some  dreamed of a republic in which noble tax exemptions  would be abolished. Despite initial successes, the revolt  lacked unity and strong leadership and could not withstand  the forces of aristocratic reaction.4 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In France urban disorders became so frequent an aspect  of the social and political landscape as to be “a distinctive  feature of life.5 Major insurrections occurred at  Dijon in 1630 and 1668, at Bordeaux in 1635 and 1675,  at Montpellier in 1645, at Lyons in 1667–1668 and  1692, and at Amiens in 1685, 1695, 1704, and 1711. All  were characterized by deep popular anger, a vocabulary  of violence, and what a recent historian calls “the culture  of retribution—that is, the punishment of royal “outsiders,  officials who attempted to announce or collect  taxes.6 These officials were sometimes seized, beaten,  and hacked to death. For example, in 1673 Louis XIV’s  imposition of new taxes on legal transactions, tobacco,  and pewter ware provoked an uprising in Bordeaux. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Municipal and royal authorities often struggled to  overcome popular revolt. They feared that stern repressive  measures, such as sending in troops to fire on  crowds, would create martyrs and further inflame the situation,  while forcible full-scale military occupation of a  city would be very expensive. The limitations of royal authority  gave some leverage to rebels. Royal edicts were  sometimes suspended, prisoners released, and discussions  initiated. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" By the end of the seventeenth century, this leverage  had largely disappeared. Municipal governments were  better integrated into the national structure, and local  authorities had prompt military support from the central  government. People who publicly opposed royal policies  and taxes received swift and severe punishment.7 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the Middle Ages jurists held that as a consequence of  monarchs’ coronation and anointment with sacred oil,  they ruled “by the grace of God. Law was given by "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" God; kings discovered or “found the law and acknowledged  that they must respect and obey it. In the absolutist  state, kings amplified these claims, asserting that, as  they were chosen by God, they were responsible to God  alone. They claimed exclusive power to make and enforce  laws, denying any other institution or group the authority  to check their power. "}

It is necessary that his  power be such that no one can hope to escape him, and,  finally, the only protection of individuals against the public  authority should be their innocence.

{"prompt":"","completion":" The Foundations of Absolutism:  Henry IV, Sully, and Richelieu "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Louis XIV’s absolutism had long roots. In 1589 his  grandfather Henry IV (r. 1589–1610), the founder of  the Bourbon dynasty, acquired a devastated country.  Civil wars had wracked France since 1561. Catastrophically  poor harvests meant that peasants across France  lived on the verge of starvation. Commercial activity had  fallen to one-third its 1580 level. Nobles, officials, merchants,  and peasants wanted peace, order, and stability.  “Henri le Grand (Henry the Great), as the king was  called, promised “a chicken in every pot and inaugurated  a remarkable recovery. He was beloved because of  the belief that he cared about the people; he was the only  king whose statue the Paris crowd did not tear down in  the Revolution of 1789. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Aside from a short war in 1601, Henry kept France at  peace. Maintaining that “if we are without compassion for  the people, they must succumb and we all perish with  them, Henry sharply lowered taxes on the overburdened  peasants.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Along with his able chief minister, the Protestant Maximilien  de Béthune, duke of Sully, Henry IV laid the  foundations for the growth of state power. He combined  the indirect taxes on salt, sales, and transit and leased their  collection to financiers. Although the number of taxes declined,  revenues increased because of the revival of trade.8  Henry improved the infrastructure of the country, building  new roads and canals and repairing the ravages of  years of civil war. In only twelve years he restored public  order in France. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As a divinely appointed leader of his people, Henry  sought to heal the religious divisions that had torn France  apart. In 1598 he issued the Edict of Nantes as a compromise  between Catholics and Huguenots. The edict  allowed Protestants the right to worship in 150 traditionally  Protestant towns throughout France; the king gave  the towns 180,000 écus to support the maintenance of  their military garrisons. This was too much for some devout  Catholics. Henry was murdered in 1610 by François  Ravaillac, a Catholic zealot, setting off national crisis. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" After the death of Henry IV his wife, the queen-regent  Marie de’ Medici, headed the government for the child- king Louis XIII (r. 1610–1643). In 1624 Marie de’  Medici secured the appointment of Armand Jean du  Plessis—Cardinal Richelieu (1585–1642)—to the council  of ministers. It was a remarkable appointment. The  next year Richelieu became president of the council, and  after 1628 he was first minister of the French crown.  Richelieu used his strong influence over King Louis XIII  to exalt the French monarchy as the embodiment of the  French state. One of the greatest servants of that state,  Richelieu struggled through the turmoil of the Thirty  Years’ War to maintain the monarchy’s position within  Europe and within its own borders. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Richelieu’s goal was to subordinate competing groups  and institutions to the French monarchy. The nobility  constituted the foremost threat. Nobles ran the army,  controlled large provinces of France, sat in royal councils,  and were immune from direct taxation. Richelieu sought  to curb their power. In 1624 he succeeded in reshuffling  the royal council, eliminating potential power brokers.  Thereafter Richelieu dominated the council in an unprecedented  way. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The constructive genius of Cardinal Richelieu is best  reflected in the administrative system he established to  strengthen royal control. He extended the use of the royal  commissioners called intendants. France was divided into  thirty-two généralités (districts), in each of which after  1634 a royal intendant held a commission to perform  specific tasks, often financial but also judicial and policing.  Intendants painstakingly collected information from  local communities for Paris and delivered royal orders  from the capital to their districts. Almost always recruited  from the newer judicial nobility, the noblesse de robe or  robe nobility, intendants were appointed directly by the  monarch, to whom they were solely responsible. They  could not be natives of the districts where they held authority;  thus they had no vested interest in their localities.  The intendants recruited men for the army, supervised the  collection of taxes, presided over the administration of  local law, checked up on the local nobility, and regulated  economic activities—commerce, trade, the guilds, marketplaces— in their districts. They were to use their power  for three related purposes: to inform the central government  about their généralités, to enforce royal orders, and  to undermine the influence of the regional nobility. As  the intendants’ power increased under Richelieu, so did  the power of the centralized French state. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Under Richelieu the French monarchy also reasserted  the principle of one people united by one faith. In 1627  Louis XIII decided to end Protestant military and political  independence because, he said, it constituted “a  state within a state. According to Louis, Huguenots  demanded freedom of conscience but did not allow  Catholics to worship in their cities. He interpreted this  inequity as political disobedience.9 Attention focused on  La Rochelle, fourth largest of the French Atlantic ports  and a major commercial center with strong ties to the  northern Protestant states of Holland and England.  Louis personally supervised the siege of La Rochelle. After  the city fell in October 1628, its municipal government  was suppressed and its walled fortifications were  destroyed. Although Protestants retained the right of  public worship, the king reinstated the Catholic liturgy,  and Cardinal Richelieu himself celebrated the first Mass.  The fall of La Rochelle weakened the influence of aristocratic  Huguenots and was one step in the removal of  Protestantism as a strong force in French life. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" In building the French state, Richelieu knew that his  approach sometimes seemed to contradict traditional  Christian teaching. As a priest and bishop, how did he  justify his policies? He developed his own raison d’état  (reason of state): “Where the interests of the state are  concerned, God absolves actions which, if privately committed,  would be a crime.10 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Richelieu’s successor as chief minister for the boy-king  Louis XIV was Cardinal Jules Mazarin (1602–1661).  Along with the regent, Queen Mother Anne of Austria,  Mazarin continued Richelieu’s centralizing policies. His  struggle to increase royal revenues to meet the costs of  war with Spain led to the uprisings of 1648–1653 known  as the Fronde. The word fronde means “slingshot or  “catapult, and a frondeur was originally a street urchin  who threw mud at the passing carriages of the rich. The  word came to be applied to the many individuals and  groups who opposed the policies of the government.  The Fronde began among the robe nobility when the  judges of the Parisian high law court (the Parlement) rejected  Anne and Mazarin’s proposal to raise new revenues  by rescinding judicial salaries. The arrest of several  magistrates sparked a popular riot in the capital, whose  inhabitants had suffered to meet the costs of war. With  the boy-king, Anne of Austria fled the capital for safety.  Essentially traditional and conservative, the magistrates  agreed to a compromise with the government that  largely favored their demands. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The second stage of the Fronde saw the conflict extend  to the noblesse d’épée or sword nobility, who were also  angered by the increasing powers of the central government.  The Prince de Condé, one of the highest nobles  in France, entered open warfare against the Crown, followed  by other nobles and their followers. Popular rebellions  led by aristocratic factions broke out in the  provinces and spread to Paris.11 As rebellion continued,  civil order broke down completely. In 1651 Anne’s regency  ended with the declaration of Louis as king in his  own right. Much of the rebellion died away, and its leaders  came to terms with the government. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The conflicts of the Fronde had significant results for  the future. First, it became apparent that compromise between  the king and the sword and robe nobility was nec"}

This meant, in some ways, a victory for  the forces opposing the king, who were guaranteed the  preservation of their traditional privileges. However, the  Fronde also quelled—and in some cases killed—the most  vociferous opponents of the Crown. The twin evils of noble  factionalism and popular riots left the French wishing  for peace and for a strong monarch to re-impose order.  This was the legacy that Louis XIV inherited when he assumed  personal rule in 1661. Humiliated by his flight  from Paris, he was determined to avoid any recurrence of  rebellion. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Louis XIV and Absolutism "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the reign of Louis XIV (r. 1643–1715), the longest in  European history, the French monarchy reached the  peak of absolutist development. In the magnificence of  his court, in the brilliance of the culture that he presided  over and that permeated all of Europe, and in his remarkably  long life, the “Sun King dominated his age. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The boy-king received an education appropriate for his  position. He learned to speak Italian and Spanish fluently,  spoke and wrote elegant French, and knew some  French history and a great deal of European geography.  Louis also imbibed the devout Catholicism of his  mother, Anne of Austria, and throughout his long life  scrupulously performed his religious duties. Religion,  Anne, and Mazarin all taught Louis the doctrine of the  divine right of kings: God had established kings as his  rulers on earth, and they were answerable ultimately to  God alone. Though kings were divinely anointed and  shared in the sacred nature of divinity, they could not  simply do as they pleased. They had to obey God’s laws  and rule for the good of the people. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Louis worked very hard at the business of governing.  He ruled his realm through several councils of state, which  he personally attended, and through the intendants who  acted for the councils in the provinces.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Religion was also a tool of national unity under Louis,  who continued Richelieu’s persecution of Protestants.

Moreover, Richelieu had already deprived  French Calvinists of political rights. Why, then,  did Louis XIV undertake such an apparently unnecessary,  cruel, and self-destructive measure? First, Louis considered  religion primarily a political question. Although he  was personally tolerant, he hated division within the  realm and insisted that religious unity was essential to his  royal dignity and to the security of the state. As he put  it, his goal was “one king, one law, one faith. Second,  while France in the early years of Louis’s reign permitted  religious liberty, it was not a popular policy. Aristocrats "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Louis’s personal hold on power, his exclusion of great  nobles from his councils, and his ruthless pursuit of religious  unity persuaded many earlier historians that his  reign witnessed the creation of an absolute monarchy.  Louis supposedly crushed the political pretensions of the  nobility, leaving them with social grandeur and court  posing but no real power. A later generation of historians  has revised that view, showing the multiple constraints on  Louis’s power and his need to cooperate with the nobles.  Louis may have declared his absolute power, but in practice  he governed through collaboration with nobles, who  maintained tremendous prestige and authority in their  ancestral lands. Scholars also underline the traditional nature  of Louis’s motivations. Like his predecessors, Louis  XIV sought to enhance the glory of his dynasty and his  country, mostly through war. The creation of a new state  apparatus was a means to that goal, not an end in itself. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Financial and Economic Management  Under Louis XIV: Colbert "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" France’s ability to build armies and fight wars depended  on a strong economy. The king named Jean-Baptiste  Colbert (1619–1683), the son of a wealthy merchant- financier of Reims, as controller general of finances. Colbert  came to manage the entire royal administration and  proved himself a financial genius. His central principle  was that the wealth and the economy of France should  serve the state. He did not invent the system called “mercantilism,  but he rigorously applied it to France. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Mercantilism is a collection of governmental policies  for the regulation of economic activities, especially commercial  activities, by and for the state. In seventeenth- and eighteenth-century economic theory, a nation’s international  power was thought to be based on its wealth,  specifically its gold supply. Because resources were limited,  mercantilist theory held, state intervention was  needed to secure the largest part of a limited resource. To  accumulate gold, a country always had to sell more goods  abroad than it bought. Colbert thus insisted that France  should be self-sufficient, able to produce within its borders  everything French subjects needed. Consequently,  the outflow of gold would be halted; debtor states would  pay in bullion; unemployment and poverty would greatly "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" diminish; and with the wealth of the nation increased, its  power and prestige would be enhanced. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Colbert attempted to accomplish self-sufficiency by  supporting old industries and creating new ones, especially  in textiles, the most important sector of the economy.  To ensure high-quality finished products, Colbert  reinforced the system of state inspection and regulation  and formed guilds in many industries. Colbert encouraged  foreign craftsmen to immigrate to France, and he  gave them special privileges. He also took measures to  bring more female workers into the labor force. To protect  French goods, he abolished many domestic tariffs  and enacted high foreign tariffs, which prevented foreign  products from competing with French ones. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" One of Colbert’s most ambitious projects was the creation  of a merchant marine to transport French goods.  He gave bonuses to French shipowners and shipbuilders  and established a method of maritime conscription, arsenals,  and academies for training sailors. In 1661 France  possessed 18 unseaworthy vessels; by 1681 it had 276  frigates, galleys, and ships of the line. In 1664 Colbert  founded the Company of the East Indies with (unfulfilled)  hopes of competing with the Dutch for Asian trade. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Primary Source: Colbert Promotes “The Advantages  of Overseas Trade "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Colbert also hoped to make Canada—rich in untapped  minerals and some of the best agricultural land in the  world—part of a vast French empire. He gathered four  thousand peasants from western France and shipped  them to Canada, where they peopled the province of  Quebec. (In 1608, one year after the English arrived at  Jamestown, Virginia, Sully had established the city of  Quebec, which became the capital of French Canada.)  Subsequently, the Jesuit Jacques Marquette and the merchant  Louis Joliet sailed down the Mississippi River and  took possession of the land on both sides as far south as  present-day Arkansas. In 1684 the French explorer  Robert La Salle continued down the Mississippi to its  mouth and claimed vast territories and the rich delta for  Louis XIV. The area was called, naturally, “Louisiana. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Colbert’s most pressing concern was tax collection. Extensive  military reform, war, an expanding professional  bureaucracy, and the court at Versailles cost a great deal  of money. Yet there were many difficulties in raising  taxes. English kings relied on one national assembly, Parliament,  for consent to taxation for the entire country.  The French system was both more complicated and more  inequitable. In some provinces, provincial estates (rep"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \f resentative bodies of clergy, nobles, and  commoners) held the authority to negotiate  with the Crown over taxes. In provinces  without estates, the king held direct control  over taxation through his intendants.  Throughout France the nobility and clergy  enjoyed exemption from the direct property  tax, or taille; even bourgeois city-dwellers  often gained exemption from it. This meant  that the tax burden fell most heavily on  those with the least wealth. Finally, the  practice of subcontracting tax collection to  financiers, known as tax-farmers, meant that  a good portion of state money fell into private  hands. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Despite these difficulties, Colbert managed  to raise revenues significantly by cracking  down on inefficiencies and corruption.  During Colbert’s tenure as controller general,  Louis was able to pursue his goals  without massive tax increases and without  creating a stream of new offices. The constant  pressure of warfare after Colbert’s  death, however, undid many of his economic  achievements. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Louis XIV wrote that “the character of a conqueror is regarded  as the noblest and highest of titles. In pursuit of  the title of conqueror, he kept France at war for thirty- three of the fifty-four years of his personal rule. In 1666  Louis appointed François le Tellier (later, marquis de  Louvois) as secretary of state for war. Under the king’s  watchful eye, Louvois created a professional army that  was modern in the sense that the French state, rather  than private nobles, employed the soldiers. Louvois utilized  several methods in recruiting troops: dragooning,  in which press gangs seized men off the streets; conscription;  and, after 1688, lottery. With these techniques, the  French army grew to some 340,000 men at its height,  enormous by the standards of the day. Louvois also imposed  new levels of professionalization. Uniforms and  weapons were standardized and a rational system of training  and promotion devised.

The mining of  gold and silver was always the most important industry in  the colonies. The Crown claimed the quinto, one-fifth of  all precious metals mined in South America. Gold and silver  yielded the Spanish monarchy 25 percent of its total  income. In return, it shipped manufactured goods to the  Americas and discouraged the development of native  industries. "}

After the union of the Crowns of Portugal  and Spain in 1580, Spanish administrative forms were  introduced. Local officials called corregidores held judicial  and military powers.

In the seventeenth century  the use of black slave labor made possible the cultivation  of coffee and cotton, and in the eighteenth  century Brazil led the world in the production of sugar.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Under absolutist monarchs, culture became an instrument  of state power. The baroque style in art and music  flourished in the context of the Catholic Reformation.  Baroque masters like Rubens painted portraits celebrating  the glory of European monarchs. The baroque was  particularly popular in Spain, Italy, and central Europe.  Along with art, architecture became an important tool  for absolutist monarchs. Louis XIV made the magnificent  palace of Versailles the center of his kingdom, inspiring  imitators across Europe (see Chapter 17). Even language  reflected the growing power of the Crown. Within France  Richelieu established an academy to oversee French literature  and language. Outside its borders French became  the common language of the European elite. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" • What cultural forms flourished under absolutist  governments?  Baroque Art and Music "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Throughout European history, the cultural tastes of one  age have often seemed unsatisfactory to the next. So it  was with the baroque. The term baroque itself may have  come from the Portuguese word for an “odd-shaped,  imperfect pearl and was commonly used by late- eighteenth-century art critics as an expression of scorn  for what they considered an overblown, unbalanced style.  These critics also scorned the Gothic style of medieval  cathedrals in favor of a classicism inspired by antiquity  and the Renaissance. Specialists now agree that the baroque  style marked one of the high points in the history  of Western culture. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Rome and the revitalized Catholic Church of the later  sixteenth century played an important role in the early  development of the baroque. The papacy and the Jesuits  encouraged the growth of an intensely emotional, exuberant  art. These patrons wanted artists to go beyond the  Renaissance focus on pleasing a small, wealthy cultural  elite. They wanted artists to appeal to the senses and  thereby touch the souls and kindle the faith of ordinary  churchgoers while proclaiming the power and confidence  of the reformed Catholic Church. In addition to this underlying  religious emotionalism, the baroque drew its  sense of drama, motion, and ceaseless striving from the  Catholic Reformation. The interior of the famous Jesuit  Church of Jesus in Rome—the Gesù—combined all these  characteristics in its lavish, shimmering, wildly active decorations  and frescoes. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Taking definite shape in Italy after 1600, the baroque  style in the visual arts developed with exceptional vigor in  Catholic countries—in Spain and Latin America, Austria,  southern Germany, and Poland. Yet baroque art was  more than just “Catholic art in the seventeenth century  and the first half of the eighteenth. True, neither Protestant  England nor the Netherlands ever came fully under  the spell of the baroque, but neither did Catholic France.  And Protestants accounted for some of the finest examples  of baroque style, especially in music. The baroque  style spread partly because its tension and bombast spoke  to an agitated age that was experiencing great violence  and controversy in politics and religion. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In painting, the baroque reached maturity early with  Peter Paul Rubens (1577–1640), the most outstanding  and most representative of baroque painters.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Court Culture "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For much of the seventeenth century, the courts of Europe  looked to France, and to the palace of Versailles, for  cultural as well as political inspiration. (See the feature  “Listening to the Past: The Court at Versailles on pages  556–557.) Versailles began as a modest hunting lodge.  Under Louis XIV’s orders, his architects, Le Nôtre and  Le Vau, turned what the duke of Saint-Simon called “the  most dismal and thankless of sights into a magnificent "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \f palace. Everywhere, the viewer had a sense of grandeur,  vastness, and elegance. Enormous staterooms became  display galleries for inlaid tables, Italian marble statuary,  tapestries woven at the royal factory in Paris, and beautiful  furniture. In the gigantic Hall of Mirrors, hundreds  of candles illuminated the domed ceiling, where allegorical  paintings celebrated the king’s victories. The formal  gardens celebrated the rationality and order imposed by  the Sun King; its classical sculptures depicted Louis as  Apollo, king of the gods. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In 1682 Louis formally established his court at Versailles,  which became the center of the kingdom: a model  of rational order and the perfect symbol of the king’s  power. The art and architecture of Versailles were tools of  Louis’s policy, used to overawe his subjects and foreign  visitors. The Russian tsar Peter the Great imitated Versailles  in the construction of his palace, Peterhof, as did  the Prussian emperor Frederick the Great in his palace at  Potsdam outside Berlin and the Habsburgs at Schonbrunn  outside Vienna. (See the feature “Images in Society:  Absolutist Palace Building on pages 568–569.) "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The palace was the summit of political, social, and cultural  life. The king required all great nobles to spend at  least part of the year in attendance on him at Versailles.  Between three thousand and ten thousand people occupied  the palace each day. Given the demand for space,  even high nobles had to make do with cramped and uncomfortable  living quarters. The palace gardens, and the  palace itself on some occasions, were open to the public,  allowing even local peasants a glimpse of their sovereign.  More than a royal residence or administrative center,  Versailles was a mirror of French greatness to the world. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Much has been made of the “domestication of the  nobility at Versailles. Elaborate rituals attended every  moment of Louis’s day, from waking up and dressing in  the morning to removing his clothing and retiring at  night. Nobles had to follow a tortuous system of court  etiquette, and they vied for the honor of serving the  monarch, with the highest in rank claiming the privilege  to hand the king his shirt. Endless squabbles broke out  over what type of chair one could sit on at court and the  order in which great nobles entered and were seated in  the chapel for Mass. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" These rituals were far from meaningless or trivial. The  king controlled immense resources and privileges; access  to him meant favored treatment for pensions, military  and religious posts, honorary titles, and a host of other  benefits. Courtiers sought these rewards for themselves  and for their family members and followers. As in ancient  Rome, patron-client relations—in which a higher-ranked  individual protected a lower-ranked one in return for "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" One family demonstrates the interplay between the  state’s rationalizing impulses and its reliance on very traditional  patterns of nepotism and patronage. Long credited  as the “modernizer of the French army, the  minister Louvois acquired his position through family  ties, not merit. His father, Michel LeTellier was secretary  of war from 1643 to 1677; Louvois succeeded his father  in this position from 1677 to his death in 1691 and was  succeeded in turn by his own son Barbézieux from 1691  to 1701. The Louvois family not only had powerful connections  within the French bureaucracy, but also bought  court offices for younger family members to ensure their  influence at Versailles. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Although they were denied public offices and posts,  women played a central role in the patronage system. At  court, the king’s wife, mistresses, and other female relatives  used their high rank to establish their own patronage  relations. They recommended individuals for honors,  advocated policy decisions, and brokered alliances between  noble factions. Noblewomen played a similar role,  bringing their family connections to marriage to form  powerful social networks. Onlookers sometimes resented  the influence of powerful women at court. The Duke of  Saint-Simon said of Madame de Maintenon, Louis XIV’s  mistress and secret second wife: "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The power of Madame de Maintenon was, as may be imagined,  immense. She had everybody in her hands, from the  highest and most favored ministers to the meanest subject of  the realm. Many people have been ruined by her, without  having been able to discover the author of the ruin, search as  they might. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" French Classicism "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" To this day, culture is a central element of French national  pride and identity. French emphasis on culture dates back  to Cardinal Richelieu, whose efforts at state centralization  embraced cultural activities. In 1635 he gave official  recognition to a group of scholars interested in grammar  and rhetoric. Thus was born the French Academy. With  Richelieu’s encouragement, the French Academy began  the preparation of a dictionary to standardize the French  language; the dictionary was completed in 1694 and has  been updated in many successive editions. The Academy  survives today as a prestigious society, and retains authority  over correct usage in the French language. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Scholars characterize the art and literature of the age  of Louis XIV as French classicism. By this they mean that  the artists and writers of the late seventeenth century imitated  the subject matter and style of classical antiquity,  that their work resembled that of Renaissance Italy, and  that French art possessed the classical qualities of discipline,  balance, and restraint. This was a movement away  from the perceived excesses of baroque style. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Louis XIV danced gracefully at court ballets in his  youth and was an enthusiastic patron of the arts. Music  and theater frequently served as backdrops for court ceremonials.  Louis favored Jean-Baptiste Lully (1632–1687),  whose orchestral works combined lively animation with  the restrained austerity typical of French classicism. Lully  also composed court ballets, and his operatic productions  were a powerful influence throughout Europe. Louis supported  François Couperin (1668–1733), whose harpsichord  and organ works possessed the regal grandeur the  king loved, and Marc-Antoine Charpentier (1634–1704),  whose solemn religious music entertained him at meals.  Charpentier received a pension for the Te Deums, hymns  of thanksgiving, he composed to celebrate French military  victories. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Louis XIV loved the stage, and in the plays of Molière  and Racine his court witnessed the finest achievements in  the history of the French theater. When Jean-Baptiste  Poquelin (1622–1673), the son of a prosperous tapestry  maker, refused to join his father’s business and entered  the theater, he took the stage name “Molière. As playwright,  stage manager, director, and actor, Molière produced  comedies that exposed the hypocrisies and follies  of society through brilliant caricature. Tartuffe satirized  the religious hypocrite; Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme (The  Bourgeois Gentleman) attacked the social parvenu; and  Les Précieuses ridicules (The Pretentious Young Ladies)  mocked the pretensions of the précieuses, elite women  who ran intellectual salons and wrote and spoke in an elegant  and pretentious manner. In structure Molière’s  plays followed classical models, but they were based on  careful social observation. Molière made the bourgeoisie  the butt of his ridicule; he stopped short of criticizing the  high nobility, reflecting the policy of his royal patron. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Primary Source: Molière’s Bourgeois Gentlewoman,  Mme. Jourdain, Rejects a Noble Son-in-Law "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" While Molière dissected social mores, his contemporary  Jean Racine (1639–1699) based his tragic dramas  on Greek and Roman legends. His persistent theme was  the conflict of good and evil. Several plays—Andromaque,  Bérénice, Iphigénie, and Phèdre—bear the names of "}

His tragedies and Molière’s comedies are still produced  today. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With Versailles as the center of European politics,  French culture grew in international prestige. Beginning  in the reign of Louis XIV, French became the language of  polite society and international diplomacy. French also  gradually replaced Latin as the language of scholarship  and learning. The royal courts of Sweden, Russia, Poland,  and Germany all spoke French. In the eighteenth century  the great Russian aristocrats were more fluent in French  than in Russian. In England the first Hanoverian king,  George I, spoke fluent French and only halting English.  France inspired a cosmopolitan European culture in the  late seventeenth century, which looked to Versailles as  its center. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" While France and later Prussia, Russia, and Austria solved  the question of sovereignty with the absolutist state,  England and Holland evolved toward the constitutional  state. Constitutionalism is the limitation of government  by law. Constitutionalism also implies a balance between  the authority and power of the government, on the one  hand, and the rights and liberties of the subjects, on  the other. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A nation’s constitution may be written or unwritten. It  may be embodied in one basic document, occasionally revised  by amendment, like the Constitution of the United  States. Or it may be only partly formalized and include  parliamentary statutes, judicial decisions, and a body of  traditional procedures and practices, like the English  and Dutch constitutions. Whether written or unwritten,  a constitution gets its binding force from the government’s  acknowledgment that it must respect that constitution— that is, that the state must govern according to  the laws. In a constitutional monarchy, a king or queen  serves as the head of state and possesses some residual  political authority, but the ultimate, or sovereign, power  rests in the electorate. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" • What is constitutionalism, and how did this form of  government emerge in England and the Dutch Republic?  Absolutist Claims in England  (1603–1649) "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In 1588 Queen Elizabeth I of England exercised very  great personal power; by 1689 the English monarchy was  severely circumscribed. Change in England was anything  but orderly. Seventeenth-century England executed one  king and experienced a bloody civil war; experimented  with military dictatorship, then restored the son of the  murdered king; and finally, after a bloodless revolution,  established constitutional monarchy. Political stability  came only in the 1690s. After such a violent and tumultuous  century, how did England produce a constitutional  monarchy? What combination of political, socioeconomic,  and religious factors brought on a civil war in 1642–1649  and then the constitutional settlement of 1688–1689? "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The extraordinary success of Elizabeth I rested on her  political shrewdness and flexibility, her careful management  of finances, her wise selection of ministers, her  clever manipulation of Parliament, and her sense of royal  dignity and devotion to hard work. A rare female monarch,  Elizabeth imposed her authority in part by refusing  to marry. If she had married, proper wifely submission to  her husband would have made it difficult to assert royal  authority over her subjects. The problem with this strategy  was that it left the queen with no immediate heir to  continue her legacy. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In 1603 Elizabeth’s Scottish cousin James Stuart succeeded  her as James I (r. 1603–1625). King James was  well educated, learned, and, with thirty-five years’ experience  as king of Scotland, politically shrewd. But he was  not as interested in displaying the majesty of monarchy as  Elizabeth had been. Urged to wave at the crowds who  waited to greet their new ruler, James complained that he  was tired and threatened to drop his breeches “so they  can cheer at my arse. The new king failed to live up to  the role expected of him in England. Moreover, in contrast  to Elizabeth, James was a poor judge of character,  and in a society already hostile to the Scots, James’s Scottish  accent was a disadvantage.16 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" James’s greatest problems, however, arose in resistance  to his claims for monarchical authority. Like his French  counterpart, James was devoted to the theory of the divine  right of kings. He expressed his ideas in his essay  “The Trew Law of Free Monarchy. According to James "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I, a monarch has a divine (or God-given) right to his authority  and is responsible only to God. Rebellion is the  worst of political crimes. If a king orders something evil,  the subject should respond with passive disobedience but  should be prepared to accept any penalty for noncompliance.  James went so far as to lecture the House of  Commons: “There are no privileges and immunities  which can stand against a divinely appointed King. This  notion, implying total royal jurisdiction over the liberties,  persons, and properties of English men and women,  formed the basis of the Stuart concept of absolutism.  Such a view ran directly counter to the long-standing  English idea that a person’s property could not be taken  away without due process of law. James’s expression of  such views before the English House of Commons was a  grave political mistake. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The House of Commons guarded the state’s pocketbook,  and James and later Stuart kings badly needed to  open that pocketbook. Elizabeth had left James a sizable  royal debt. Elizabeth had managed to escape public disapprobation  for the debt, but James was left to face the  consequences. Elizabeth had also left her Stuart successors  a House of Commons that appreciated its own financial  strength and intended to use that strength to  acquire a greater say in the government of the state. The  knights and burgesses who sat at Westminster in the  late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries wanted a  voice in royal expenditures, religious reform, and foreign  affairs. Essentially, the Commons wanted a measure of  sovereignty. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Profound social changes had occurred since the sixteenth  century. The English House of Commons during  the reigns of James I and his son Charles I (r. 1625–  1649) was very different from the assembly Henry VIII  had manipulated into passing his Reformation legislation.  The dissolution of the monasteries and the sale of  monastic land had enriched many people. Enclosure of  the common lands and new agricultural techniques had  also enriched landowners, while many people invested  successfully in commercial ventures, such as the expanding  cloth industry.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Religious Divides "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Religious issues also embittered relations between the  king and the House of Commons. In the early seventeenth  century increasing numbers of English people felt  dissatisfied with the Church of England established by  Henry VIII and reformed by Elizabeth. Many Puritans  (see page 463) believed that the Reformation had not  gone far enough. They wanted to “purify the Anglican  church of Roman Catholic elements—elaborate vestments  and ceremonials, bishops, and even the giving and wearing  of wedding rings. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It is difficult to establish what proportion of the English  population was Puritan. According to present scholarly  consensus, the dominant religious groups in the  early seventeenth century were Calvinist; their more zealous  members were Puritans. It also seems clear that many  English people were attracted by the socioeconomic  implications of John Calvin’s theology. Calvinism emphasized  hard work, sobriety, thrift, competition, and postponement  of pleasure, and it tended to link poverty with  weakness and moral corruption. These values, which have  frequently been called the “Protestant ethic or “capitalist  ethic, fit in precisely with the economic approaches  and practices of many successful business people and  farmers. While it is hazardous to identify capitalism with  Protestantism—there were many successful Catholic capitalists,  for example—the “Protestant virtues represented  the prevailing values of members of the House of  Commons. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Puritans wanted to abolish bishops in the Church of  England, and when James I said, “No bishop, no king,  he meant that the bishops were among the chief supporters  of the throne. His son Charles I gave the impression  of being sympathetic to Roman Catholicism. First,  Charles married the French Catholic princess Henrietta  Maria, a daughter of Henry IV. Charles also supported  the policies of William Laud (1573–1645), archbishop  of Canterbury, who tried to impose elaborate ritual on  all churches. Laud insisted on complete uniformity of  church services and enforced that uniformity through an "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" In 1637 Laud attempted to impose two new elements  on church organization in Scotland: a new prayer book,  modeled on the Anglican Book of Common Prayer, and  bishoprics, which the Presbyterian Scots firmly rejected.  The Scots therefore revolted. To finance an army to put  down the Scots, King Charles was compelled to summon  Parliament in November 1640. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Charles I was an intelligent man, but contemporaries  found him deceitful, dishonest, and treacherous. After  quarreling with Parliament over his right to collect customs  duties on wine and wool and over what the Commons  perceived as religious innovations, Charles had  dissolved Parliament in 1629. From 1629 to 1640, he  ruled without Parliament, financing his government  through extraordinary stopgap levies considered illegal  by most English people. For example, the king revived a  medieval law requiring coastal districts to help pay the  cost of ships for defense, but he levied the tax, called  “ship money, on inland as well as coastal counties. Most  members of Parliament believed that such taxation without  consent amounted to despotism. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Consequently, they were not willing to  trust the king with an army. Moreover,  many supported the Scots’ resistance to  Charles’s religious innovations and had  little wish for military action against  them. Accordingly, this Parliament,  called the “Long Parliament because it  sat from 1640 to 1660, enacted legislation  that limited the power of the  monarch and made arbitrary government  impossible. "}

King Charles,  fearful of a Scottish invasion—the original reason for  summoning Parliament—accepted these measures. Understanding  and peace were not achieved, however,  partly because radical members of the Commons pushed  increasingly revolutionary propositions, and partly because  Charles maneuvered to rescind those he had already  approved.

Ever since Henry II had  conquered Ireland in 1171, English governors had mercilessly  ruled the land, and English landlords had ruthlessly  exploited the Irish people.

In 1641 the Catholic gentry led an  uprising in response to a feared invasion by anti-Catholic  forces of the Long Parliament. "}

After a failed attempt  to arrest parliamentary leaders, Charles left London for  the north of England. There, he recruited an army drawn  from the nobility and its cavalry staff, the rural gentry,  and mercenaries. The parliamentary army was composed  of the militia of the city of London, country squires with  business connections, and men with a firm belief in the  spiritual duty of serving. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The English civil war (1642–1649) tested whether sovereignty  in England was to reside in the king or in Parliament.  In 1645 Parliament reorganized its forces into the  New Model Army under the leadership of Sir Thomas  Fairfax and Oliver Cromwell, a member of the House of  Commons who had emerged as a military leader during  the war. After three years of inconclusive fighting, parliamentary  forces finally defeated the king’s armies at the  Battles of Naseby and Langport in the summer of 1645.  To all appearances, the war was over and the parliamentary  side had prevailed. The only remaining issue was to  obtain formal recognition from Charles on restrictions  on royal authority and church reform. Charles, though,  refused to concede defeat. Both sides jockeyed for position,  waiting for a decisive event. This arrived in the form "}

He  divided England into twelve military districts, each governed  by a major general. The state rigorously censored  the press, forbade sports, and kept the theaters closed in  England. On the issue of religion, Cromwell favored  some degree of toleration, and the Instrument of Government  gave all Christians except Roman Catholics the  right to practice their faith. As for Irish Catholicism,  Cromwell identified it with sedition and heresy. In September  1649 his army crushed a rebellion at Drogheda  and massacred the garrison. Another massacre followed  in October. These brutal acts left a legacy of Irish hatred  for England that has not yet subsided. Cromwell defended  his actions by claiming to have acted only against  soldiers in arms and said that a strong deterrent would  prevent future bloodshed. After Cromwell’s departure  for England, the atrocities worsened. Sir William Petty,  who served the English government in Ireland, estimated  that over six hundred thousand people, or one-third of  Ireland’s population, died or were exiled as a result of the  civil wars. The English banned Catholicism in Ireland,  executed priests, and confiscated land from Catholics for  English and Scottish settlers. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In England, Cromwell’s regulation of the nation’s  economy had features typical of seventeenth-century absolutism.  The lord protector’s policies were mercantilist,  similar to those Colbert established in France. Cromwell  enforced a Navigation Act (1651), requiring that English  goods be transported on English ships. The Navigation  Act was a great boost to the development of an English  merchant marine and brought about a short but successful  war with the commercially threatened Dutch.

And what was to be the relationship between the king  and Parliament? "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" About the first of these issues, Charles II, an easygoing  and sensual man, was basically indifferent. He was not  interested in doctrinal issues. Members of Parliament  were, and they enacted a body of laws that sought to  compel religious uniformity. Those who refused to receive  the Eucharist of the Church of England could not  vote, hold public office, preach, teach, attend the universities,  or even assemble for meetings, according to the  Test Act of 1673. But these restrictions could not be enforced.  When the Quaker William Penn held a meeting  of his Friends and was arrested, the jury refused to convict  him. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In politics Charles II was determined “not to set out  in his travels again, which meant that he intended to  get along with Parliament. Generally good rapport existed  between the king and the strongly royalist Parliament  that had restored him. This rapport was due largely  to the king’s appointment of a council of five men who  served both as his major advisers and as members of  Parliament, thus acting as liaison agents between the executive  and the legislature. This body—known as the  “Cabal from the names of its five members (Clifford,  Arlington, Buckingham, Ashley-Cooper, and Lauderdale)— was an ancestor of the later cabinet system. Although  its members sometimes disagreed and intrigued  among themselves, it gradually came to be accepted that  the Cabal was answerable in Parliament for the decisions  of the king. This development gave rise to the concept of  ministerial responsibility: royal ministers must answer to  the Commons. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Harmony between the Crown and Parliament rested  on the understanding that Charles would summon frequent  Parliaments and that Parliament would vote him  sufficient revenues.

A combination of hatred for French absolutism  and hostility to Catholicism produced virtual hysteria.  The Commons passed an exclusion bill denying the succession  to a Roman Catholic, but Charles quickly dissolved  Parliament, and the bill never became law. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When James II (r. 1685–1688) succeeded his brother,  the worst English anti-Catholic fears, already aroused by  Louis XIV’s revocation of the Edict of Nantes, were realized.  In violation of the Test Act, James appointed Roman  Catholics to positions in the army, the universities,  and local government. When these actions were challenged  in the courts, the judges, whom James had appointed,  decided for the king. The king was suspending  the law at will and appeared to be reviving the absolutism  of his father and grandfather. He went further. Attempting  to broaden his base of support with Protestant dissenters  and nonconformists, James issued a declaration of  indulgence granting religious freedom to all. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Two events gave the signals for revolution. First, seven  bishops of the Church of England petitioned the king  that they not be forced to read the declaration of indulgence  because of their belief that it was an illegal act.  They were imprisoned in the Tower of London but subsequently  acquitted amid great public enthusiasm. Second,  in June 1688 James’s second wife produced a male  heir. A Catholic dynasty seemed ensured. The fear of a  Roman Catholic monarchy supported by France and ruling  outside the law prompted a group of eminent persons  to offer the English throne to James’s Protestant  daughter Mary and her Dutch husband, Prince William  of Orange. In December 1688 James II, his queen, and  their infant son fled to France and became pensioners  of Louis XIV. Early in 1689 William and Mary were  crowned king and queen of England. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" The men who brought about the revolution quickly  framed their intentions in the Bill of Rights, the cornerstone  of the modern British constitution. The principles  of the Bill of Rights were formulated in direct response  to Stuart absolutism. Law was to be made in Parliament;  once made, it could not be suspended by the Crown.  Parliament had to be called at least once every three  years. Both elections to and debate in Parliament were to  be free in the sense that the Crown was not to interfere  in them (this aspect of the bill was widely disregarded in  the eighteenth century). The independence of the judiciary  was established. No longer could the Crown get the  judicial decisions it wanted by threats of removal. There  was to be no standing army in peacetime—a limitation  designed to prevent the repetition of Cromwellian military  government. The Bill of Rights granted “that the  subjects which are Protestants may have arms for their  defense suitable to their conditions and as allowed by  law,17 meaning that Catholics could not possess arms  because the Protestant majority feared them. Additional  legislation granted freedom of worship to Protestant dissenters  and nonconformists and required that the English  monarch always be Protestant. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Glorious Revolution found its best defense in political  philosopher John Locke’s Second Treatise of Civil  Government (1690). Locke (1632–1704) maintained  that people set up civil governments to protect life, liberty,  and property. A government that oversteps its proper  function—protecting the natural rights of life, liberty,  and property—becomes a tyranny. (By “natural rights  Locke meant rights basic to all men because all have the  ability to reason.) Under a tyrannical government, the  people have the natural right to rebellion. Such rebellion  can be avoided if the government carefully respects the  rights of citizens and if people zealously defend their liberty.  Arguing for a close relationship between economic  and political freedom, Locke linked economic liberty and  private property with political freedom. On the basis of  this link, he justified limiting the vote to property owners.  Locke served as the great spokesman for the liberal  English revolution of 1688 and 1689 and for representative  government. His idea that there are natural or universal  rights equally valid for all peoples and societies was  especially popular in colonial America. (Colonists also  appreciated his arguments that Native Americans had no  property rights since they did not cultivate the land and, "}

Foreign merchants coming to Amsterdam could buy  anything from precision lenses for the microscope (recently  invented by Dutchman Anton van Leeuwenhoek)  to muskets for an army of five thousand. Although Dutch  cities became famous for their exports—diamonds and  linens from Haarlem, pottery from Delft—Dutch wealth  depended less on exports than on transport. "}

Amsterdam and Rotterdam built massive granaries  where the surplus of one year could be stored against  possible shortages the next. Thus, except in the 1650s,  when bad harvests reduced supplies, food prices fluctuated  very little.

But war with France and England in the 1670s hurt the  United Provinces. The long War of the Spanish Succession— in which the Dutch prince William of Orange,  who was King William III of England, utilized English  wealth in the Dutch fight against Louis XIV—was a  costly drain on Dutch labor and financial resources. The  peace signed in 1713 to end the war marked the beginning  of Dutch economic decline. "}

Most parts of Europe experienced the seventeenth century  as a period of severe economic, social, and military  crisis. Across the continent, rulers faced popular rebellions  from their desperate subjects, who were pushed to  the brink by poor harvests, high taxes, and decades of war.

Whether they ruled  through monarchical fiat or parliamentary negotiation,  European governments strengthened their bureaucracies,  raised more taxes, and significantly expanded their armies. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" According to Thomas Hobbes, the central drive in  every human is “a perpetual and restless desire of Power,  after Power, that ceaseth only in Death. The seventeenth  century solved the problem of sovereign power in two  fundamental ways: absolutism and constitutionalism.  Under Louis XIV France witnessed the high point of absolutist  ambition in western Europe. The king saw himself  as the representative of God on earth, and it has been  said that “to the seventeenth century imagination God  was a sort of image of Louis XIV.20 Under Louis’s rule,  France developed a centralized bureaucracy, a professional  army, and a state-directed economy, all of which he personally  supervised.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Despite his claims to absolute power, historians now  agree that Louis XIV ruled, in practice, by securing the  collaboration of high nobles. In exchange for confirmation  of their ancient privileges, the nobles were willing to  cooperate with the expansion of state power. This was a  common pattern in attempts at absolutism across Europe.  In Spain, where monarchs made similar claims to  absolute power, the seventeenth century witnessed economic  catastrophe and a decline in royal capacities. Spanish  rule continued in the colonies and foreshadowed a  revival of Spanish fortunes in the eighteenth century. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" France’s dominant political role in Europe elevated its  cultural influence as well. French became the common  language of the European elite, as all heads turned to  Versailles and the radiant aristocratic culture emanating  from it. Within France, the Bourbon monarchy pursued  culture as one more aspect of absolutist policy, creating  cultural academies, sponsoring playwrights and musicians,  and repressing Protestantism with a bloody hand. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As Louis XIV personified absolutist ambitions, so Stuart  England exemplified the evolution of the constitutional  state. The conflicts between Parliament and the  first two Stuart rulers, James I and Charles I, tested  where sovereign power would reside. The resulting civil  war did not solve the problem. The Instrument of Government  provided for a balance of government authority  and recognition of popular rights; as such, the Instrument  has been called the first modern constitution. Unfortunately,  it lacked public support. James II’s absolutist  tendencies brought on the Glorious Revolution of 1688  and 1689, and the people who made that revolution settled  three basic issues: sovereign power was divided between  king and Parliament, with Parliament enjoying the  greater share; government was to be based on the rule of  law; and the liberties of English people were made explicit  in written form in the Bill of Rights.

Dominated by Holland, the Netherlands provided  a shining example of industriousness, prosperity,  and relative tolerance for the rest of Europe. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" He availed himself of the frequent festivities at  Versailles, and his excursions to other places, as  a means of making the courtiers assiduous in  their attendance and anxious to please him; for  he nominated beforehand those who were to take  part in them, and could thus gratify some and  inflict a snub on others. He was conscious that  the substantial favours he had to bestow were not  nearly sufficient to produce a continual effect; he  had therefore to invent imaginary ones, and no  one was so clever in devising petty distinctions  and preferences which aroused jealousy and  emulation. The visits to Marly later on were very  useful to him in this way; also those to Trianon  [Marly and Trianon were small country houses],  where certain ladies, chosen beforehand, were  admitted to his table. It was another distinction  to hold his candlestick at his coucher; as soon as  he had finished his prayers he used to name the  courtier to whom it was to be handed, always  choosing one of the highest rank among those  present. . . . "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Not only did he expect all persons of  distinction to be in continual attendance at  Court, but he was quick to notice the absence of  those of inferior degree; at his lever [formal rising  from bed in the morning], his coucher [preparations  for going to bed], his meals, in the gardens  of Versailles (the only place where the courtiers  in general were allowed to follow him), he used  to cast his eyes to right and left; nothing escaped  him, he saw everybody. If any one habitually  living at Court absented himself he insisted on  knowing the reason; those who came there only  for flying visits had also to give a satisfactory  explanation; any one who seldom or never  appeared there was certain to incur his displeasure.  If asked to bestow a favour on such persons he  would reply haughtily: “I do not know him; of  such as rarely presented themselves he would say,  “He is a man I never see; and from these  judgements there was no appeal.

Many a man in all ranks of life  was ruined by these methods, often very  unjustly, without ever being able to  discover the reason; and when the King  had once taken a prejudice against a  man, he hardly ever got over it. . . .

{"prompt":"","completion":" No one understood better than Louis XIV  the art of enhancing the value of a favour by his  manner of bestowing it; he knew how to make  the most of a word, a smile, even of a glance.

Motives of policy  had something to do with this; by making  expensive habits the fashion, and, for people in  a certain position, a necessity, he compelled his  courtiers to live beyond their income, and  gradually reduced them to depend on his bounty  for the means of subsistence. This was a plague  which, once introduced, became a scourge to the  whole country, for it did not take long to spread  to Paris, and thence to the armies and the  provinces; so that a man of any position is now  estimated entirely according to his expenditure on  his table and other luxuries.

This process differed from  developments in western Europe, where peasants won  greater freedom and the urban middle class continued its  rise. The Thirty Years’ War represented the culmination  of these changes. Decades of war in central Europe led to  depopulation and economic depression, which allowed  lords to impose ever-harsher controls on the peasantry. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" • What social and economic changes affected central and  eastern Europe from 1400 to 1650?  Origins of Serfdom "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The period from 1050 to 1300 was a time of general economic  expansion in eastern Europe characterized by the  growth of trade, towns, and population. This meant  clearing the forests and colonizing the frontier beyond  the Elbe River. Eager to attract settlers to sparsely populated  lands, the rulers of eastern Europe offered newcomers  economic and legal incentives, providing land on  excellent terms and granting greater personal freedom.  These benefits were also gradually extended to the local  Slavic populations, even those of central Russia. Thus, by  1300 serfdom had all but disappeared in eastern Europe.  Peasants bargained freely with their landlords and moved  about as they pleased. Opportunities and improvements  in the East had a positive impact on the West, where the  weight of serfdom was also reduced between 1100 and  1300. Thus fundamental social and economic developments  moved in tandem across Europe in the High Middle  Ages. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" After about 1300, however, as Europe’s population and  economy declined grievously, mostly as a result of the  Black Death, East and West parted paths. Across Europe,  lords sought to solve their economic problems by more  heavily exploiting the peasantry. This reaction generally  failed in the West, where by 1500 almost all peasants  were free or had their serf obligations greatly reduced.  East of the Elbe, however, the landlords won. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Eastern landlords successfully used their political and  police power against the peasantry in two ways. First,  they restricted or eliminated the peasants’ time-honored  right of freedom of movement. Thus a peasant could no  longer leave the land without his lord’s permission, and  the lord had no reason to make such concessions. In  Prussian territories by 1500 the law required that runaway  peasants be hunted down and returned to their  lords. Until the mid-fifteenth century, medieval Russian  peasants were free to move wherever they wished. Thereafter  this freedom was gradually curtailed, so that by  1497 a Russian peasant had the right to move only dur"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" ing a two-week period after the fall harvest. Eastern peasants  were losing their status as free and independent men  and women. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Second, lords steadily took more of their peasants’ land  and imposed heavier labor obligations. Instead of being  independent farmers paying freely negotiated rents, peasants  became forced laborers on the lords’ estates. By the  early 1500s, lords in many territories could command  their peasants to work without pay as many as six days  a week. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The gradual erosion of the peasantry’s economic position  was bound up with manipulation of the legal system.  The local lord was also the local prosecutor, judge, and  jailer. There were no independent royal officials to provide  justice or uphold the common law, allowing lords to  rule in their own favor in disputes with peasants. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Consolidation of Serfdom "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Between 1500 and 1650 the social, legal, and economic  conditions of peasants in eastern Europe continued to  decline, and free peasants became serfs. In Poland nobles  gained complete control over their peasants in 1574, after  which they could legally inflict the death penalty  whenever they wished. In Prussia in 1653 peasants were  assumed to be tied to their lords in hereditary subjugation— bound to their lords and the land from one generation  to the next. In Russia peasants’ right to move from  an estate was permanently abolished in 1603. In 1649  the tsar lifted the nine-year time limit on the recovery of  runaways and eliminated all limits on lords’ authority over  their peasants. Although political development in the various  Eastern states differed, the legal re-establishment of  permanent hereditary serfdom was the common fate of  Eastern peasants by the mid-seventeenth century. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The consolidation of serfdom accompanied the growth  of estate agriculture, particularly in Poland and eastern  Germany. In the sixteenth century European economic  expansion and population growth resumed after the great  declines of the late Middle Ages. Prices for agricultural  commodities also rose sharply as gold and silver flowed in  from the New World. Thus Polish and German lords had  powerful economic incentives to increase the production  of their estates. And they did. Lords seized more peasant  land for their own estates and then demanded more  unpaid labor on those enlarged estates.

{"prompt":"","completion":" The Holy Roman Empire was a confederation of hundreds  of principalities, independent cities, duchies, and  other polities loosely united under an elected emperor.  An uneasy truce had prevailed in the Holy Roman Empire  since the Peace of Augsburg of 1555 (see page 459).  According to the settlement, the faith of the prince determined  the religion of his subjects. Later in the century,  however, Catholics grew alarmed because Lutherans, in  violation of the Peace of Augsburg, were steadily acquiring  German bishoprics. The spread of Calvinism further  confused the issue: the Augsburg settlement had pertained  only to Lutheranism and Catholicism, so Calvinists  ignored it and converted several princes. Also, the  militantly active Jesuits had reconverted several Lutheran  princes to Catholicism. Lutherans feared that the Augsburg  principles would be undermined by Catholic and  Calvinist gains. Lutheran princes felt compelled to form  the Protestant Union (1608), and Catholics retaliated  with the Catholic League (1609). Each alliance was determined  that the other should make no religious or territorial  advance. Dynastic interests were also involved;  the Spanish Habsburgs strongly supported the goals of  their Austrian relatives—the unity of the empire and the  preservation of Catholicism within it. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Violence erupted in 1617 when Ferdinand of Styria,  the new Catholic king in Bohemia, closed some Protestant  churches. On May 23, 1618, Protestants hurled two  of Ferdinand’s officials from a castle window in Prague.  They fell seventy feet but survived: Catholics claimed  that angels had caught them; Protestants said that the officials  had fallen on a heap of soft horse manure. Called  the “defenestration of Prague, this event marked the  beginning of the Thirty Years’ War (1618–1648). "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The war is traditionally divided into four phases. The  first, or Bohemian, phase (1618–1625) was characterized  by civil war in Bohemia between the Catholic League,  led by Ferdinand, and the Protestant Union, headed by  Frederick, the elector of the Palatinate. The Bohemians  fought for religious liberty and independence from Habsburg  rule. In 1620 Catholic forces defeated Frederick at  the Battle of the White Mountain. Ferdinand, who had  recently been elected Holy Roman emperor as Ferdinand  II, followed up his victories by wiping out Protestantism  in Bohemia through forcible conversions and Jesuit missionary  work. Within ten years Bohemia was completely  Catholic. "}

The Catholic imperial  army led by Albert of Wallenstein swept through  Silesia, north to the Baltic, and east into Pomerania, scoring  smashing victories.

He quarreled  with the Catholic League, and soon the Catholic  forces were divided. Religion was eclipsed as a basic issue  of the war. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Habsburg power peaked in 1629. The emperor issued  the Edict of Restitution, whereby all Catholic properties  lost to Protestantism since 1552 were restored, and only  Catholics and Lutherans were allowed to practice their  faiths.

{"prompt":"","completion":" The third, or Swedish, phase of the war (1630–1635)  began with the arrival in Germany of the Swedish king  Gustavus Adolphus (r. 1594–1632).

In 1631, with a small but  well-disciplined army equipped with superior muskets,  Gustavus Adolphus won a brilliant victory at Breitenfeld.  Again in 1632 he was victorious at Lützen, though he  was fatally wounded in the battle.  The participation of the Swedes in the Thirty Years’  War proved decisive for the future of Protestantism and  German history. When Gustavus Adolphus landed on  German soil, he headed a Baltic empire under Swedish influence.  The Swedish victories ended the Habsburg ambition  to unite the German states under imperial authority. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gustavus Adolphus’s death in 1632, followed by the  Swedes’ defeat at the Battle of Nördlingen in 1634,  prompted the French to enter the war on the Protestant  side, beginning the French, or international, phase of the  Thirty Years’ War (1635–1648). For almost a century  French foreign policy was based on opposition to the  Habsburgs because a weak empire enhanced France’s international  stature. In 1635 Cardinal Richelieu declared  war on Spain and again sent financial and military assistance  to the Swedes and the German Protestant princes.  The war dragged on. The French, Dutch, and Swedes,  supported by Scots, Finns, and German mercenaries,  burned, looted, and destroyed German agriculture and  commerce. The Thirty Years’ War lasted so long because  neither side had the resources to win a quick, decisive victory.  Finally, in October 1648 peace was achieved. "}

The treaties  recognized the sovereign, independent authority of more  than three hundred German princes (see Map 17.1).  Since the time of Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II  (1194–1250) , Germany had followed a pattern of state- building different from that of France and England: the  emperor shared authority with the princes. After the  Peace of Westphalia, the emperors’ power continued to  be severely limited, and the Holy Roman Empire remained  a loosely knit federation. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The peace agreement acknowledged the independence  of the United Provinces of the Netherlands.

All of Europe was experiencing  severe inflation due to the influx of Spanish silver,  but the destruction of land and foodstuffs made the  price rise worse in central Europe than anywhere else.  Agricultural areas suffered catastrophically. Many small  farmers lacked the revenue to rework their holdings and  had to become day laborers.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Serfdom and the Thirty Years’ War aided Eastern rulers  greatly in their attempts to build absolute monarchies.  These rulers not only fought one another but also battled  with armies of invaders from Asia. In this atmosphere of  continual wartime emergency, monarchs were able to increase  the powers of the central state. In exchange for  leaving nobles the unchallenged masters of their peasants,  the would-be absolutist monarchs of central and eastern  Europe gradually gained political power in three key areas.  First, they imposed permanent taxes without consent.  Second, they maintained permanent standing armies to  police the country and fight abroad. Third, they conducted  relations with other states as they pleased. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As with all general historical developments, there  were important variations on the absolutist theme in  eastern Europe. Royal absolutism in Prussia was  stronger and more effective than in Austria. This would  give Prussia a thin edge in the struggle for power in east- central Europe in the eighteenth century. Prussian-style  absolutism had great long-term political significance, for  it was a rising Prussia that unified the German people in  the nineteenth century and imposed on them a militaristic  stamp.

{"prompt":"","completion":" The Austrian Habsburgs controlled a scattered group of  territories in central and eastern Europe. By 1618 the  Habsburg realm included the German-speaking provinces  of Austria, Tyrol, and Styria; the Czech-speaking kingdom  of Bohemia; and parts of the kingdom of Hungary.  Habsburg lands encompassed different languages, ethnicities,  and religious affiliations; some lay within the  Holy Roman Empire and some beyond its borders. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Like all of central Europe, the Habsburgs emerged  from the Thirty Years’ War impoverished and exhausted.  Their efforts to destroy Protestantism in the German  lands and to turn the weak Holy Roman Empire into a  real state had failed. Although the Habsburgs remained  the hereditary emperors, real power lay in the hands of a  bewildering variety of separate political jurisdictions, including  independent cities, small principalities, medium- size states such as Bavaria and Saxony, and some of the  territories of Prussia and the Habsburgs. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Defeat in central Europe encouraged the Habsburgs  to turn away from a quest for imperial dominance and to  focus inward and eastward in an attempt to unify their diverse  holdings. An important step in this direction had  occurred in Bohemia during the Thirty Years’ War. Protestantism  had been strong among the Czechs in Bohemia.  The lesser Czech nobility was largely Protestant in 1600  and had considerable political power because it dominated  the Bohemian Estates—the representative body  of the different estates, or legal orders. The Habsburgs  believed that religious diversity fatally weakened royal  power. If they could not impose Catholicism in the empire,  at least they could do so in their own domains. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In 1618 the Bohemian Estates rose up in defense of  Protestant rights. The Habsburgs crushed the revolt in  1620 at the Battle of the White Mountain. The victorious  king, Ferdinand II (r. 1619–1637), drastically reduced  the power of the Bohemian Estates. He also confiscated  the landholdings of many Protestant nobles and gave  them to a few loyal Catholic nobles and to the foreign  aristocratic mercenaries who led his armies. After 1650 a  large portion of the Bohemian nobility was of recent origin  and owed everything to the Habsburgs. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" The Hungarians resisted because many of them remained  Protestants, especially in areas formerly ruled by  the Turks. Ottoman rule had been relatively light-handed  compared to the harsh reconversion efforts of the Habsburgs.  Until the end of the seventeenth century the Ottomans  still ruled parts of Hungary, providing a powerful  military ally to nobles in areas recovered by the Habsburgs.  Finally, the Hungarian nobility, and even part of  the peasantry, became attached to a national ideal long  before most of the other peoples of eastern Europe. Hungarian  nobles were determined to maintain as much independence  and local control as possible. In 1703, with  the Habsburgs bogged down in the War of the Spanish  Succession (see page 534), the Hungarians rose in one  last patriotic rebellion under Prince Francis Rákóczy. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Rákóczy and his forces were eventually defeated, but  the Habsburgs had to accept a compromise. Charles VI  restored many of the traditional privileges of the aristocracy  in return for Hungarian acceptance of hereditary  Habsburg rule. Thus Hungary, unlike Austria and Bohemia,  was never fully integrated into a centralized, absolute  Habsburg state. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Despite checks on their ambitions in Hungary, the Habsburgs  made significant achievements in state-building by  forging consensus with the church and the nobility. A  sense of common identity and loyalty to the monarchy  grew among elites in Habsburg lands, even to a certain  extent in Hungary. The best evidence for this consensus  is the spectacular sums approved by the estates for the  growth of the army. By the end of the seventeenth century  Emperor Leopold commanded a standing army of a  hundred thousand men funded by contributions from  the provincial estates. German became the language of  the common culture and, with ongoing Protestant conversion  and emigration, zealous Catholicism also helped  fuse a collective identity. Vienna became the political and  cultural center of the empire. By 1700 it was a thriving  city with a population of one hundred thousand, with its  own version of Versailles, the royal palace of Schönbrunn.

{"prompt":"","completion":" After 1400 a revitalized landed nobility became the undisputed  ruling class in eastern Germany. The Hohenzollern  family, which ruled through its senior and junior  branches as the imperial electors of Brandenburg and the  dukes of Prussia, had little real power. Nothing suggested  that this family and its territories would ever play  an important role in European or even regional affairs.  The elector of Brandenburg had the right to help  choose the Holy Roman emperor, which bestowed prestige,  but the elector had no military strength of his own.  Moreover, Brandenburg, the area around Berlin and the  elector’s power base, was a land-locked combination of  sand and swamp (see Map 17.2) that lacked defensible  natural frontiers. Contemporaries contemptuously called  it the “sand-box of the Holy Roman Empire.2 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The territory of the elector’s cousin, the duke of Prussia,  was completely separated from Brandenburg and  was part of the kingdom of Poland. By 1600 Prussia’s  German-speaking peasants had much in common with  Polish peasants, for both ethnic groups had seen most of  their freedoms reduced or revoked by their noble landlords.  (Poland’s numerous lesser nobles dominated the  Polish state, which was actually a constitutional republic  headed by an elected king who had little real power.) In  1618 the junior branch of the Hohenzollern family died  out, and Prussia reverted to the elector of Brandenburg. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The elector of Brandenburg was a helpless spectator in  the Thirty Years’ War, his territories alternately ravaged  by Swedish and Habsburg armies. Population fell drastically,  and many villages disappeared. Yet this devastation  paved the way for Hohenzollern absolutism because foreign  armies dramatically weakened the political power of  the estates, which helped the very young elector Frederick  William (r. 1640–1688), later known as the “Great  Elector, to ride roughshod over traditional representative  rights and to take a giant step toward royal absolutism.

{"prompt":"","completion":" When he came to power in 1640, the twenty-year-old  Great Elector was determined to unify his three provinces  and enlarge them by diplomacy and war. These provinces  were Brandenburg; Prussia, inherited in 1618; and scattered  holdings along the Rhine, inherited in 1614 (see  Map 17.2). Each was inhabited by German-speakers, but  each had its own estates. Although the estates had not  met regularly during the chaotic Thirty Years’ War, taxes  could not be levied without their consent. The estates of  Brandenburg and Prussia were dominated by the nobility  and the landowning classes, known as the Junkers. But  this was also the case in most European countries that  had representative bodies, including the English Parliament  before and after the civil war. Had the estates successfully  resisted the absolutist demands of the Great  Elector, they too might have evolved toward more  broadly based constitutionalism. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The struggle between the Great Elector and the provincial  estates was long and intense. After the Thirty Years’  War, noble representatives zealously reasserted the estates’  control over taxes. Yet first in Brandenburg in 1653  and then in Prussia between 1661 and 1663, the Great  Elector eventually had his way. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" To pay for the permanent standing army he first established  in 1660, Frederick William forced the estates to  accept the introduction of permanent taxation without  consent. The estates’ power declined rapidly thereafter,  for the Great Elector had both financial independence  and superior force. The state’s total revenue tripled during  his reign, and the size of the army leaped by ten. In  1688 a population of one million was supporting a peacetime  standing army of thirty thousand. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Two factors were central to the Great Elector’s triumph.  First, as in the formation of every absolutist state, "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \f war was a decisive factor. The ongoing struggle between  Sweden and Poland for control of the Baltic after 1648  and the wars of Louis XIV in western Europe created an  atmosphere of permanent crisis. The nomadic Tatars of  the Crimea in southern Russia swept through Prussia in  the winter of 1656–1657, killing and carrying off thousands  as slaves. This invasion softened up the estates and  strengthened the urgency of the Great Elector’s demands  for more military funding. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Second, the nobility proved willing to accept Frederick  William’s new claims in exchange for reconfirmation of  their own privileges. The Junkers had long dominated the  government through the estates, but they refused to join  representatives of the towns in a common front. Instead,  they accepted a compromise with the state whereby the  bulk of the new taxes fell on towns and the Junkers received  legal confirmation of their authority over the serfs.  The elector used naked force to break the liberties of the  towns; the main leader of urban opposition in the key  city of Königsberg, for example, was arrested and imprisoned  for life without trial. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Like Louis XIV, the Great Elector built his absolutist  state on collaboration with traditional elites, reaffirming  their privileges in return for loyal service and revenue. He  also created a larger centralized government bureaucracy  to oversee his realm and to collect the new taxes. Preexisting  representative institutions were bypassed. The  Diet of Brandenburg did not meet again after 1652. In  1701 the elector’s son, Frederick I, received the elevated  title of king of Prussia (instead of elector) as a reward for  aiding the Holy Roman emperor in the War of the Spanish  Succession. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Consolidation of  Prussian Absolutism "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Frederick William I, “the Soldiers’ King (r. 1713–1740),  completed his grandfather’s work. Though crude and  ruthless, Frederick William I was the most talented reformer  produced by the Hohenzollern family. Under his  rule, Prussia built the best army in Europe for its size and  transformed into a model military state. It was he who  truly established Prussian absolutism and gave it its unique  character. In the words of a famous historian of Prussia: "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For a whole generation, the Hohenzollern subjects were victimized  by a royal bully, imbued with an obsessive bent for  military organization and military scales of value. This left a  deep mark upon the institutions of Prussiandom and upon  the molding of the “Prussian spirit.3 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Rise of Austria and Prussia • 571 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Frederick William was intensely attached to military  life. He had, for example, an extreme fondness for tall soldiers,  whom he credited with superior strength and endurance.  Profoundly militaristic in temperament, Frederick  William always wore an army uniform, and he lived the  highly disciplined life of the professional soldier. He began  his work by five or six in the morning; at ten he almost  always went to the parade ground to drill or inspect  his troops. His love of the army was based on a hardheaded  conception of the struggle for power. Years later  he summed up his life’s philosophy in his instructions  to his son: “A formidable army and a war chest large  enough to make this army mobile in times of need can  create great respect for you in the world, so that you can  speak a word like the other powers.4 This unshakable  belief that the welfare of king and state depended on the  army above all else reinforced Frederick William’s passion  for the soldier’s life. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The cult of military power provided the rationale for  a great expansion of absolutism in Prussia. As the king  put it: “I must be served with life and limb, with house  and wealth, with honour and conscience, everything must  be committed except eternal salvation—that belongs to  God, but all else is mine.5 To achieve these extraordinary  demands, Frederick William created a strong centralized  bureaucracy and eliminated the last traces of the  parliamentary estates and local self-government. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The king’s power grab brought him into considerable  conflict with the Junkers. In his early years he even  threatened to destroy them; yet, in the end, the Prussian  nobility was not destroyed but enlisted—into the army.  Responding to a combination of threats and opportunities,  the Junkers became the officer caste. A new compromise  was worked out whereby the proud nobility  imperiously commanded the peasantry in the army as  well as on the estates. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Penny-pinching and hard-working, Frederick William  achieved results. Above all, he built a first-rate army with  third-rate resources. The standing army increased from  thirty-eight thousand to eighty-three thousand during  his reign. Prussia, twelfth in Europe in population, had  the fourth largest army by 1740. Moreover, soldier for  soldier, the Prussian army was the best in Europe, astonishing  foreign observers with its precision, skill, and discipline.  For the next two hundred years Prussia and then  Prussianized Germany would win many crucial military  battles. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" There was no question in the mind of Europeans, however,  that the Ottomans were outsiders. Even absolutist  rulers disdained Ottoman sultans as cruel and tyrannical  despots. Despite stereotypes, the Ottomans were in many  ways more tolerant than the West, providing protection  and security to other religions while steadfastly maintaining  their Muslim faith.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Unification transformed the internal political situation.  Although the Mongols conquered, they were quite willing  to use local princes as obedient servants and tax collectors.  Thus, they did not abolish the title of “great prince, bestowing  it instead on the prince who served them best and  paid them most handsomely. Beginning with Alexander  Nevsky in 1252, the princes of Moscow became particularly  adept at serving the Mongols. They loyally put down  popular uprisings and collected the khan’s taxes. As reward,  the princes of Moscow emerged as hereditary great  princes. Eventually the Muscovite princes were able to destroy  their princely rivals. Ivan III (r. 1462–1505) consolidated  power around Moscow and won Novgorod, almost  reaching the Baltic Sea (see Map 17.3). "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" By about 1480 Ivan III felt strong enough to stop acknowledging  the khan as his supreme ruler. To legitimize  their new authority, the princes of Moscow drew  on two sources of authority. First, they declared themselves  autocrats, meaning that, like the khans, they were  the sole source of power. In addition to political authority,  Moscow also took over Mongol tribute relations and  borrowed institutions like the tax system, postal routes,  and the census. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The second source of legitimacy lay in Moscow’s claim  to the political and religious inheritance of the Byzantine  Empire. The title tsar is a contraction of caesar. After the  fall of Constantinople to the Turks in 1453, the princes  of Moscow saw themselves as the heirs of both the caesars  and Orthodox Christianity, the one true faith. All the  other kings of Europe were heretics; only the tsars were  rightful and holy rulers. The idea was promoted by Orthodox  churchmen, who spoke of “holy Russia as the  “Third Rome. Ivan’s marriage to the daughter of the  last Byzantine emperor further enhanced the aura of  Moscow’s imperial inheritance. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Historians long took at face value the tsars’ claims to  unlimited autocratic power over their people, from the  peasants to the highest-ranking nobles or boyars. More  recently they have begun to emphasize the considerable  consensus that existed between the nobility and the self- styled autocrat. Along with Mongol tribute relations,  Moscow inherited a tradition of ruling in cooperation  with local elites. The tsars’ success in combining grandiose  claims to power with an extremely limited government  apparatus is explained through their collaboration  with boyars in Moscow and with the provincial gentry.  The Russian Orthodox Church helped cement this consensus.  Since the national borders of Russia corresponded  to the borders of the church, religion was a source of patriotic  nationalism and loyalty to the Crown. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The tsars ensured the loyalty of the elite in part by creating  new nobles personally loyal to them. These new nobles  made up the service nobility, whose members held  the tsar’s land on the explicit condition that they serve in  his army. "}

He defeated the  khanates of Kazan and Astrakhan between 1552 and  1556, adding vast new territories to the realm and laying  the foundations for the huge, multiethnic Russian empire.  In the course of these wars, Ivan virtually abolished  the old distinction between hereditary boyar private  property and land temporarily granted for service.

Cossacks and peasants  called for the “true tsar, who would restore their  freedom of movement, reduce their heavy taxes, and  lighten the yoke imposed by the landlords. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This social explosion from below brought the nobles,  big and small, to their senses. They put aside their quarrels  and finally crushed the Cossack rebellion at the gates  of Moscow. In 1613 the nobles elected Ivan the Terrible’s  sixteen-year-old grandnephew, Michael Romanov,  the new hereditary tsar (r. 1613–1645). Michael’s election  was represented as a restoration of tsarist autocracy.  (See the feature “Listening to the Past: A Foreign Traveler  in Russia on pages 586–587.) "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Although the new tsar successfully reconsolidated central  authority, social and religious uprisings continued  through the seventeenth century. In 1652 the patriarch  Nikon determined to bring “corrupted Russian practices  of worship into line with the Greek Orthodox model.  The self-serving church hierarchy quickly went along,  but the intensely religious common people resisted. They  saw Nikon as the Antichrist who was stripping them of  the only thing they had—the true religion of “holy Russia.  Great numbers left the church and formed communities  of “Old Believers, who were hunted down and  persecuted. As many as twenty thousand people burned  themselves alive, singing the “hallelujah in their chants  three times rather than twice, as Nikon had demanded.  After the Great Schism, the Russian masses were alienated  from the established church, which became dependent  on the state for its authority. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Cossacks revolted once more against a state that  was doggedly trying to reduce them to serfdom.

Eventually this rebellion  was defeated. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The normal obstacles to state-building were exacerbated  in Russia’s case by the huge size of its territory, its  thinly spread population, and the economic devastation  wrought by the Time of Troubles. Nevertheless, Romanov  tsars made several important achievements during  the second half of the seventeenth century. After a long  war, Russia gained a large mass of Ukraine from weak  and decentralized Poland in 1667 (see Map 17.3) and  completed the conquest of Siberia by the end of the century.  Territorial expansion was accompanied by growth  of the bureaucracy and the army. Russian tsars turned to  imported foreign experts to help build and reform the "}

He was equally determined to continue  the tsarist tradition of territorial expansion. After  1689 Peter ruled independently for thirty-six years, only  one of which was peaceful.  Fascinated by weapons and foreign technology, the  tsar led a group of 250 Russian officials and young nobles  on an eighteen-month tour of western European  capitals. Traveling unofficially to avoid lengthy diplomatic  ceremonies, Peter worked with his hands at various  crafts and met with foreign kings and experts. He was  particularly impressed with the growing power of the  Dutch and the English, and he considered how Russia  could profit from their example. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Returning to Russia, Peter entered into a secret alliance  with Denmark and Poland to wage a sudden war of  aggression against Sweden. Despite the country’s small  population and limited agricultural resources, Swedish  rulers in the seventeenth century had developed a strong  absolutist state and had built an excellent standing army.  Like other absolutist rulers, Charles XI of Sweden built a  beautiful palace in his capital, modeled after Louis XIV’s  Versailles. Expanding beyond its borders, Sweden held  substantial territory in northern Germany, Finland, and  Estonia. Yet these possessions were scattered and appeared  vulnerable. Above all, Peter and his allies believed  that their combined forces could win easy victories because  Sweden was in the hands of a new and inexperienced  king. "}

Tightening up  Muscovy’s old service system, he required every nobleman,  great or small, to serve in the army or in the civil  administration—for life.

One of his most hated reforms was requiring a five-year  education away from home for every young nobleman.  Peter established an interlocking military-civilian bureaucracy  with fourteen ranks, and he decreed that all  had to start at the bottom and work toward the top.

The war dragged on until  1721, but Sweden never regained the offensive. Estonia  and present-day Latvia (see Map 17.3) came under Russian  rule for the first time. Russia became the dominant  power on the Baltic Sea and very much a European Great  Power. If victory or defeat is the ultimate historical criterion,  Peter’s reforms were a success. "}

Because of his feverish desire to use modern technology  to strengthen the army, many Westerners and  Western ideas flowed into Russia for the first time. For  Peter, modernization meant westernization. He thus required  nobles to shave their heavy beards and wear Western  clothing, previously banned in Russia. He required  them to attend parties where young men and women  would mix together and freely choose their own spouses.

{"prompt":"","completion":" At the same time, vast numbers of Russians hated Peter’s  massive changes. For nobles, one of Peter’s most detested  reforms was the imposition of unigeniture—inheritance of  land by one son alone—cutting daughters and other sons  from family property. For peasants, the reign of the reforming  tsar saw a significant increase in the bonds of serfdom.  The gulf between the enserfed peasantry and the educated  nobility widened more, even though all were caught up in  the demands of the sovereign. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Thus Peter built on the service obligations of old Muscovy.  His monarchical absolutism was truly the culmination  of the long development of a unique Russian  civilization.

{"prompt":"","completion":" To secure the Baltic coast, military construction was  the main concern for the next eight years. A mighty  fortress was built on the newly named Peter Island, and a  port and shipyards were built across the river on the  mainland as a Russian navy came into being. From the  inhospitable northern marshland Peter would create a future  metropolis gloriously bearing his name. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" After the decisive Russian victory at Poltava in 1709  greatly reduced the threat of Swedish armies, Peter moved  into high gear. In one imperious decree after another, he  ordered his people to build a city equal to any in the world.  Such a city had to be Western and modern, just as Peter’s "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" army had to be Western and permanent. From such a  “window on Europe, Peter believed, it would be easier to  reform the country militarily and administratively. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" These general political goals matched Peter’s architectural  ideas, which had been influenced by his travels in  western Europe. First, Peter wanted a comfortable,  “modern city. Modernity meant broad, straight, stone- paved avenues; houses built in a uniform line and not  haphazardly set back from the street; large parks; canals  for drainage; stone bridges; and street lighting. Second,  all buildings had to conform to detailed architectural regulations  set down by the government. Finally, each social  group—the nobility, the merchants, the artisans, and so  on—was to live in a certain section of town. In short, the  city and its population were to conform to a carefully defined  urban plan. "}

Just as the government drafted peasants for the army, it  also drafted twenty-five thousand to forty thousand men  each summer to labor in St. Petersburg for three months  without pay. Every ten to fifteen peasant households had  to furnish one worker each summer and then pay a special  tax in order to feed him in St. Petersburg. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Peasants hated this forced labor, and each year one- fourth to one-third of those sent risked brutal punishment  to run away. Many peasant construction workers  died from hunger, sickness, and accidents. Thus beautiful  St. Petersburg was built by the shoveling, carting, and  paving of a mass of conscripted serfs. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Peter also drafted more privileged groups to his city.  Nobles were summarily ordered to build costly stone  houses and palaces in St. Petersburg and to live in them  most of the year. The more serfs a noble possessed, the  bigger his dwelling had to be. Merchants and artisans  were also commanded to settle and build in St. Petersburg.  These nobles and merchants were then required to  pay for the city’s avenues, parks, canals, embankments,  and bridges, all of which were costly in money and lives  because they were built on a swamp. The building of St.  Petersburg was, in truth, an enormous direct tax levied  on the wealthy, which in turn forced the peasantry to do  most of the work. "}

He also rebuilt the Winter Palace as an enormous, aqua- colored royal residence, now the Hermitage Museum.  All the while St. Petersburg grew rapidly, and its almost  three hundred thousand inhabitants in 1782 made it one  of the world’s largest cities. Peter and his successors created  a magnificent royal city from nothing, which unmistakably  proclaimed the power of Russia’s rulers and the  creative potential of the absolutist state.  The Growth of the Ottoman Empire "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Most Christian Europeans perceived the Ottomans as the  antithesis of their own values and traditions and viewed "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" the empire as driven by an insatiable lust for warfare and  conquest. In their view the fall of Constantinople was a  catastrophe and the taking of the Balkans a despotic imprisonment  of those territories. The Ottoman Empire  seemed the epitome of Eastern exoticism, religious fanaticism,  and tyranny. From the perspective of the Ottomans,  the world looked very different. The siege of  Constantinople liberated a glorious city from its long decline  under the Byzantines. Rather than being a despoiled  captive, the Balkans became a haven for refugees  fleeing the growing intolerance of Western Christian  powers. The Ottoman Empire provided Jews, Muslims,  and even some Christians safety from the Inquisition and  religious war: the Iberian powers tried to impose Christianity  through conversion or exile, but Islam and Judaism  remained part of the conversation of post-Reformation  Europe because of the presence of the Ottoman Empire  at Europe’s gate. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Ottomans came out of Central Asia as conquering  warriors, settled in Anatolia (present-day Turkey), and  created one of history’s greatest empires (see pages 466  and 566). At their peak in the mid-sixteenth century under  Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent (r. 1520–1566),  they ruled the most powerful empire in the world. Their  possessions stretched from western Persia across North  Africa and into the heart of central Europe (see Map  17.4). In 1690 a Turkish visitor to Versailles wrote in his  travel diary: “The King of France is the Sultan Suleiman  of our time. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Ottoman expansion borrowed from the peoples they  conquered. They were heirs to the Byzantine Empire  and, through it, of Rome and its vision of universal empire.  From the Byzantines, they adopted the tax structure  and the use of religion to bind together a diverse empire.  From the Persians, the Ottomans borrowed political and  financial practices, and from the Arabs, religion and spirituality.  This openness and adaptability—missing from  most Western accounts of the Ottomans—was largely responsible  for the empire’s longevity. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When the Ottomans captured Constantinople in  1453, they fulfilled a long-held Islamic dream. They also  shattered a bulwark of Christian identity. Founded by the  emperor who introduced the Christian church to mighty  Rome, for a millennium Constantinople had stood as a  symbol of Christianity and its links to imperial power.  Though the Byzantine Empire gradually shrank, the city  itself had withstood numerous sieges. The loss of Constantinople  was not just symbolic but strategic as well.

{"prompt":"","completion":" The Ottoman Empire was originally built on a unique  model of state and society. There was an almost complete  absence of private landed property. Agricultural land was  the personal hereditary property of the sultan, and peasants  paid taxes to use the land. There was therefore no  security of landholding and no hereditary nobility, two  key features of western European society. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \f 582 CHAPTER 17 • ABSOLUTISM IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE TO 1740 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Ottomans also employed a distinctive form of government  administration. The top ranks of the bureaucracy  were staffed by the sultan’s slave corps. Because Muslim  law prohibited enslaving other Muslims, the sultan’s  agents purchased slaves along the borders of the empire.  Within the realm, the sultan levied a “tax of one thousand  to three thousand male children on the conquered  Christian populations in the Balkans every year. Young  slaves were raised in Turkey as Muslims and were trained  to fight and to administer. The most talented rose to the  top of the bureaucracy, where they might acquire wealth  and power; the less fortunate formed the brave and skillful  core of the sultan’s army, the janissary corps. Lurid accounts  of weeping Christian boys being carried off into  Ottoman slavery did much to foster the idea of the brutal,  fanatical Turk in the European mind. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" After 1453 Istanbul became the capital of the empire  and, with the transfer of the caliphate from Cairo, the religious  center of Sunni Islam. The “old palace was for  the sultan’s female family members, who lived in isolation  under the care of eunuchs. The newly constructed Topkapi  Palace was where officials worked and young slaves  trained for future administrative or military careers. To  prevent wives from bringing foreign influence into government— a constant concern in the West—sultans procreated  only with their concubines and not with official  wives. They also adopted a policy of allowing each concubine  to produce only one male heir. At a young age, each  son went to govern a province of the empire under his  mother’s supervision. These practices were intended to  stabilize power and prevent a recurrence of the civil wars  of the late fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Sultan Suleiman undid these policies when he boldly  married his concubine and had several children with her.  He established a wing in the Topkapi Palace for his own  female family members and his brothers’ families. Starting  with Suleiman, imperial wives began to take on more  power. Marriages were arranged between sultans’ daughters  and high-ranking servants, creating powerful new  members of the imperial household. Over time, the sultan’s  exclusive authority waned in favor of a more bureaucratic  administration. These changes brought the  Ottoman court closer to the European model of factionalism,  intrigue, and informal female power. (See the feature  “Individuals in Society: Hürrem.) "}

After holding out against great odds for  two months, the city was relieved at the last minute by  reinforcements, and the Ottomans were forced to retreat.  Soon the retreat became a rout. As Russian and  Venetian allies attacked on other fronts, the Habsburgs  conquered almost all of Hungary and Transylvania by  1699 (see Map 17.4). The Habsburgs completed their  victory in 1718, with the Treaty of Passarowitz. These  defeats might have led to reform of Ottoman political,  military, and economic structures.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Hürrem (1505?–1558) came to the harem as a slave- concubine. Like many of the sultan’s concubines, Hürrem  was of foreign birth. Tradition holds that she was born  Aleksandra Lisowska in what was the kingdom of Poland  and today is Ukraine. She was captured during a Tatar  raid and enslaved. Between 1517 and 1520, when she was  about fifteen years old, she entered the imperial harem.  Venetian reports insist that she was not outstandingly  beautiful but was possessed of wonderful grace, charm,  and good humor. These qualities gained her the Turkish  nickname Hürrem, or “joyful one. After her arrival in  the harem, Hürrem quickly became the imperial favorite. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Suleiman’s love for Hürrem led him to break all precedents  for the role of a concubine, including the rule that  concubines must cease having children once they give  birth to a male heir. By 1531 Hürrem had given birth to  one daughter and five sons. In 1533 or 1534 Suleiman  entered formal marriage with his consort—an unprecedented  honor for a concubine. He reportedly gave his  exclusive attention to his wife and also defied convention  by allowing Hürrem to remain in the palace throughout  her life instead of accompanying her son to a provincial  governorship as other concubines had done. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Contemporaries were shocked by Hürrem’s influence  over the sultan and resentful of the apparent role she  played in politics and diplomacy. The Venetian ambassador  Bassano wrote that “the Janissaries and the entire  court hate her and her children likewise, but because the  Sultan loves her, no one dares to speak.* She was suspected  of using witchcraft to control the sultan and accused  of ordering the death of the sultan’s first-born son  (with another mother) in 1553. These stories were based  on court gossip and rumor. The correspondence between  Suleiman and Hürrem, unavailable until the nineteenth  century, along with Suleiman’s own diaries, confirms her  status as the sultan’s most trusted confidant and adviser.  During his frequent absences, the pair exchanged passionate  love letters. Hürrem included information about the  political situation and warnings about any potential uprisings.  She also intervened in affairs between the empire and  her former home. She wrote to Polish king Sigismund  Augustus and seems to have helped Poland attain its "}

Drawing from reports of contemporary Western observers,  historians depicted Hürrem as a manipulative and  power-hungry social climber. They saw her career as the  beginning of a “sultanate of women in which strong imperial  leadership gave way to court intrigue and dissipation.  More recent historians have emphasized the  intelligence and courage Hürrem demonstrated in navigating  the ruthlessly competitive world of the harem.  Hürrem’s journey from Ukrainian maiden to harem  slave girl to sultan’s wife captured enormous public attention.  She is the subject of numerous paintings, plays, and  novels as well as of an opera, a ballet, and a symphony by  the composer Haydn. Interest in and suspicion of Hürrem  continues.

They recognized Christians and Jews as “peoples of the  Book who followed the same biblical tradition as Islam.  Building on the practices of the great Middle Eastern  empires, the Ottomans divided their subjects into religious  communities, and each millet, or “nation, enjoyed  autonomous self-government under its religious leaders.  (The Ottoman Empire recognized Orthodox Christians,  Jews, Armenian Christians, and Muslims as distinct millets.)  The millet system created a powerful bond between  the Ottoman ruling class and the different religious leaders,  who supported the sultan’s rule in return for extensive  authority over their own communities.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Despite its tolerance, the Ottoman Empire was an explicitly  Islamic state. Members of the Muslim religious  elite were educated at religious schools (medreses) attached  to mosques. Muftis supervised mosques and religious  schools and wrote interpretations of Islamic law, and  state-appointed kadis administered the law. Whereas non- Muslims had their own courts for dealings among themselves,  any conflict involving a Muslim was regulated by a  kadi in an Islamic court. Wariness of the Islamic courts encouraged  non-Muslims to deal with their own as much as  possible. However, the Ottomans showed the same openness  in law as in empire building. They adopted the most  flexible of Muslim law traditions, and they accepted  provincial law codes that respected pre-existing local  laws. Under Suleiman the Magnificent and his successors,  a process of legal centralization began; provincial laws  were codified and standardized. The sultan’s claim to be  caliph—the guide for the community of all Muslims—  helped legitimize this process of legal centralization. The  legal reforms won Suleiman the title “the Lawgiver from  his subjects. "}

Farther to the east, the  Ottoman sultans developed a distinctive political and  economic system in which all land theoretically belonged  to the sultan, who was served by a slave corps of administrators  and soldiers.

{"prompt":"","completion":" The emergence of modern science was a development of  tremendous long-term significance. A noted historian  has even said that the scientific revolution of the late sixteenth  and seventeenth centuries “outshines everything  since the rise of Christianity and reduces the Renaissance  and Reformation to the rank of mere episodes, mere internal  displacements, within the system of medieval Christendom.  The scientific revolution was “the real origin  both of the modern world and the modern mentality.1  This statement is an exaggeration, but not much of one.  Of all the great civilizations, only that of the West developed  modern science. With the scientific revolution Western  society began to acquire its most distinctive traits. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" • What was revolutionary in new attitudes toward the  natural world?  Scientific Thought in 1500 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Since developments in astronomy and physics were at the  heart of the scientific revolution, one must begin with  the traditional European conception of the universe. It is  important to remember that the practitioners of the scientific  revolution did not consider their field science but  rather natural philosophy. Their intention was not to  create modern science but to ask fundamental questions  about the nature of the universe, its purpose, and how it  functioned. They did not set supernatural questions  aside, as do modern scientists, but incorporated  them in their speculations, which made reference  not only to Christian theology but often to  magic, alchemy, and astrology as well. The dividing  line between matter and spirit, or reason  and faith, was much less rigid for participants  in the scientific revolution than it is for scientists  today. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the early 1500s natural philosophy was  still based primarily on the ideas of Aristotle, "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Aristotelian Universe as Imagined in the  Sixteenth Century A round earth is at the center,  surrounded by spheres of water, air, and fire. Beyond this  small nucleus, the moon, the sun, and the five planets were  embedded in their own rotating crystal spheres, with the  stars sharing the surface of one enormous sphere. Beyond,  the heavens were composed of unchanging ether. (Image  Select\/Art Resource, NY) "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" the great Greek philosopher of the fourth century B.C.  These ideas had gradually been recovered during the  Middle Ages. Medieval theologians such as Thomas  Aquinas brought Aristotelian philosophy into harmony  with Christian doctrines. According to this revised Aristotelian  view, a motionless earth was fixed at the center of  the universe. Around it moved ten separate transparent  crystal spheres. In the first eight spheres were embedded,  in turn, the moon, the sun, the five known planets, and  the fixed stars. Then followed two spheres added during  the Middle Ages to account for slight changes in the positions  of the stars over the centuries. Beyond the tenth  sphere was Heaven, with the throne of God and the souls  of the saved. Angels kept the spheres moving in perfect  circles. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Aristotle’s views, suitably revised by medieval philosophers,  also dominated thinking about physics and motion  on earth. Aristotle had distinguished sharply between  the world of the celestial spheres and that of the earth—  the sublunar world. The spheres consisted of a perfect,  incorruptible “quintessence, or fifth essence. The sub- lunar world, however, was made up of four imperfect,  changeable elements. The “light elements (air and fire)  naturally moved upward, while the “heavy elements  (water and earth) naturally moved downward. These nat"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \f ural directions of motion did not always prevail, however,  for elements were often mixed together and could be affected  by an outside force such as a human being. Aristotle  and his followers also believed that a uniform force  moved an object at a constant speed and that the object  would stop as soon as that force was removed. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Aristotle’s ideas about astronomy and physics were accepted  with minor revisions for two thousand years, and  with good reason. First, they offered an understandable,  commonsense explanation for what the eye actually saw.  Second, Aristotle’s science as interpreted by Christian  theologians fit neatly with Christian doctrines. It established  a home for God and a place for Christian souls. It  put human beings at the center of the universe and made  them the critical link in a “great chain of being that  stretched from the throne of God to the most lowly insect  on earth. Thus examination of the natural world was  primarily a branch of theology, and it reinforced religious  thought. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Copernican Hypothesis "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The desire to explain and thereby glorify God’s handiwork  led to the first great departure from the medieval  system. This departure was the work of the Polish clergyman  and astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus (1473–1543).  As a young man Copernicus studied church law and astronomy  in various European universities. He saw how  professional astronomers still depended for their most accurate  calculations on the second century B.C. work of  Ptolemy. Author of a geographical synthesis that profoundly  influenced European voyages of exploration (see  page 494), Ptolemy was also a great astronomer. His  achievement had been to work out complicated rules to  explain the minor irregularities in the movement of the  planets. These rules enabled stargazers and astrologers to  track the planets with greater precision. Many people  then (and now) believed that the changing relationships  between planets and stars influenced events on earth. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The young Copernicus was uninterested in astrology  and felt that Ptolemy’s cumbersome and occasionally inaccurate  rules detracted from the majesty of a perfect  Creator. He preferred an old Greek idea being discussed  in Renaissance Italy: that the sun, rather than the earth,  was at the center of the universe. Finishing his university  studies and returning to a church position in East Prussia,  Copernicus worked on his hypothesis from 1506 to  1530. Never questioning the Aristotelian belief in crystal  spheres or the idea that circular motion was most perfect  and divine, Copernicus theorized that the stars and  planets, including the earth, revolved around a fixed sun.

{"prompt":"","completion":" The Copernican hypothesis had enormous scientific  and religious implications, many of which the conservative  Copernicus did not anticipate. First, it put the stars  at rest, their apparent nightly movement simply a result  of the earth’s rotation. Thus it destroyed the main reason  for believing in crystal spheres capable of moving the  stars around the earth. Second, Copernicus’s theory suggested  a universe of staggering size. If in the course of a  year the earth moved around the sun and yet the stars appeared  to remain in the same place, then the universe was  unthinkably large. Finally, by characterizing the earth as  just another planet, Copernicus destroyed the basic idea  of Aristotelian physics—that the earthly world was quite "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Primary Source: Commentariolus: Copernicus Outlines  His Thesis "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Copernican hypothesis brought sharp attacks from  religious leaders, especially Protestants. Martin Luther  spoke of him as the “new astrologer who wants to prove  that the earth moves and goes round. . . . The fool wants  to turn the whole art of astronomy upside down.  Luther noted that “as the Holy Scripture tells us, so did  Joshua bid the sun stand still and not the earth.2 John  Calvin also condemned Copernicus. Catholic reaction  was milder at first. The Catholic Church had never held  to literal interpretations of the Bible, and not until 1616  did it officially declare the Copernican hypothesis false. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This slow reaction also reflected the slow progress of  Copernicus’s theory for many years. Other events were  almost as influential in creating doubts about traditional  astronomical ideas. In 1572 a new star appeared and  shone very brightly for almost two years. The new star,  which was actually a distant exploding star, made an  enormous impression on people. It seemed to contradict  the idea that the heavenly spheres were unchanging and  therefore perfect. In 1577 a new comet suddenly moved  through the sky, cutting a straight path across the supposedly  impenetrable crystal spheres. It was time, as a  typical scientific writer put it, for “the radical renovation  of astronomy.3 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" From Brahe to Galileo "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" One astronomer who agreed was Tycho Brahe (1546–  1601). Born into a prominent Danish noble family, Brahe  was tremendously impressed by a partial eclipse of the  sun at an early age. Completing his studies abroad and  returning to Denmark, he established himself as Europe’s  leading astronomer with his detailed observations of the  new star of 1572. Aided by generous grants from the  king of Denmark, Brahe built the most sophisticated observatory  of his day. For twenty years he meticulously observed  the stars and planets with the naked eye. An  imposing man who had lost a piece of his nose in a duel  and replaced it with a special bridge of gold and silver alloy,  a noble who exploited his peasants arrogantly and  approached the heavens humbly, Brahe contributed a  great mass of data. His limited understanding of mathematics  prevented him, however, from making much  sense out of his data. Part Ptolemaic, part Copernican, he "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" believed that all the planets revolved around the sun and  that the entire group of sun and planets revolved in turn  around the earth-moon system. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was left to Brahe’s brilliant young assistant, Johannes  Kepler (1571–1630), to go much further. Kepler  was a medieval figure in many ways. Coming from a minor  German noble family and trained for the Lutheran  ministry, he long believed that the universe was built on  mystical mathematical relationships and a musical harmony  of the heavenly bodies. Working and reworking  Brahe’s mountain of observations in a staggering effort  after the Dane’s death, this brilliant mathematician eventually  went beyond mystical intuitions. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Kepler formulated three famous laws of planetary motion.  First, building on Copernican theory, he demonstrated  in 1609 that the orbits of the planets around the  sun are elliptical rather than circular. Second, he demonstrated  that the planets do not move at a uniform speed  in their orbits. Third, in 1619 he showed that the time a  planet takes to make its complete orbit is precisely related  to its distance from the sun. Kepler’s contribution was  monumental. Whereas Copernicus had speculated, Kepler  proved mathematically the precise relations of a sun- centered (solar) system. His work demolished the old system  of Aristotle and Ptolemy, and in his third law he came  close to formulating the idea of universal gravitation. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" While Kepler was unraveling planetary motion, a young  Florentine named Galileo Galilei (1564–1642) was challenging  all the old ideas about motion. Like so many early  scientists, Galileo was a poor nobleman first marked for  a religious career. However, he soon became fascinated  by mathematics. A brilliant student, in 1589 Galileo became  a professor of mathematics at age twenty-five. He  proceeded to examine motion and mechanics in a new  way. Indeed, his great achievement was the elaboration  and consolidation of the experimental method. That is,  rather than speculate about what might or should happen,  Galileo conducted controlled experiments to find  out what actually did happen. In his famous acceleration  experiment, he showed that a uniform force—in this  case, gravity—produced a uniform acceleration. Here is  how Galileo described his pathbreaking method and conclusion  in his Two New Sciences: "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A piece of wooden moulding...was taken; on its edge was  cut a channel a little more than one finger in breadth. Having  made this groove very straight, smooth and polished,  and having lined it with parchment, also as smooth and polished  as possible, we rolled along it a hard, smooth and very  round bronze ball.... Noting... the time required to make  the descent...we now rolled the ball only one-quarter the "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \f length of the channel; and having measured the time of its  descent, we found it precisely one-half of the former....In  such experiments [over many distances], repeated a full  hundred times, we always found that the spaces traversed  were to each other as the squares of the times, and that this  was true for all inclinations of the plane.4 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With this and other experiments, Galileo formulated the  law of inertia. Rest was not the natural state of objects.  Rather, an object continues in motion forever unless  stopped by some external force. Aristotelian physics was  in shambles. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the tradition of Brahe, Galileo also applied the experimental  method to astronomy. On hearing details  about the invention of the telescope in Holland, Galileo  made one for himself and trained it on the heavens. He  quickly discovered the first four moons of Jupiter, which  clearly suggested that Jupiter could not possibly be embedded  in any impenetrable crystal sphere. This discovery  provided new evidence for the Copernican theory,  in which Galileo already believed. Galileo then pointed  his telescope at the moon. He wrote in 1610 in Siderus  Nuncius: "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Scientific Revolution •  593 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I feel sure that the moon is not perfectly smooth, free from  inequalities, and exactly spherical, as a large school of  philosophers considers with regard to the moon and the  other heavenly bodies. On the contrary, it is full of inequalities,  uneven, full of hollows and protuberances, just like the  surface of the earth itself, which is varied.... The next object  which I have observed is the essence or substance of  the Milky Way. By the aid of a telescope anyone may behold  this in a manner which so distinctly appeals to the senses  that all the disputes which have tormented philosophers  through so many ages are exploded by the irrefutable evidence  of our eyes, and we are freed from wordy disputes  upon the subject. For the galaxy is nothing else but a mass of  innumerable stars planted together in clusters.5 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Reading these famous lines, one feels a crucial corner  in Western civilization being turned. The traditional religious  worldview, which rested on determining and accepting  the proper established authority, was beginning  to give way to a new method. This new method of learning  and investigating was the greatest accomplishment  of the entire scientific revolution, for it proved capable of  great extension.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Galileo was employed in Florence by the Medici grand  dukes of Tuscany, and his work eventually aroused the ire  of some theologians. The issue was presented in 1624 to  Pope Urban VIII, who permitted Galileo to write about  different possible systems of the world as long as he did  not presume to judge which one actually existed. After  the publication in Italian of his widely read Dialogue on  the Two Chief Systems of the World in 1632, which openly  lampooned the traditional views of Aristotle and Ptolemy  and defended those of Copernicus, Galileo was tried for  heresy by the papal Inquisition. Imprisoned and threatened  with torture, the aging Galileo recanted, “renouncing  and cursing his Copernican errors. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Newton’s Synthesis "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The accomplishments of Kepler, Galileo, and other scientists  had taken effect by about 1640. The old astronomy  and physics were in ruins, and several fundamental  breakthroughs had been made. The new findings had  not, however, been fused together in a new synthesis, a  single explanatory system that would comprehend motion  both on earth and in the skies. That synthesis, which  prevailed until the twentieth century, was the work of  Isaac Newton (1642–1727). "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Newton was born into lower English gentry and attended  Cambridge University. A genius who spectacularly  united the experimental and theoretical-mathematical  sides of modern science, Newton was also fascinated by  alchemy. He sought the elixir of life and a way to change  base metals into gold and silver. Newton was also intensely  religious. He was far from being the perfect rationalist  so endlessly eulogized by writers in the eighteenth  and nineteenth centuries. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Of his intellectual genius and incredible powers of  concentration there can be no doubt. Arriving at some  of his most basic ideas about physics in 1666 at age  twenty-four, but unable to prove these theories mathematically,  he attained a professorship and studied optics  for many years. In 1684 Newton returned to physics for  eighteen extraordinarily intensive months. For weeks on  end he seldom left his room except to read his lectures.  His meals were sent up, but he usually forgot to eat  them, his mind fastened like a vise on the laws of the  universe. He opened the third book of his immortal  Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, published  in Latin in 1687 and generally known as the Principia,  with these lines: "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Isaac Newton This portrait suggests the depth and complexity  of the great genius. Is the powerful mind behind those  piercing eyes thinking of science or of religion, or perhaps of  both? (Scala\/Art Resource, NY) "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the preceding books I have laid down the principles of  philosophy [that is, science].... These principles are the  laws of certain motions, and powers or forces, which chiefly  have respect to philosophy....It remains that from the same  principles I now demonstrate the frame of the System of the  World. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Newton made good his grandiose claim. His towering  accomplishment was to integrate in a single explanatory  system the astronomy of Copernicus, as corrected by  Kepler’s laws, with the physics of Galileo and his predecessors.  Newton did this by means of a set of mathematical  laws that explain motion and mechanics. These laws of  dynamics are complex, and it took scientists and engineers  two hundred years to work out all their implications. Nevertheless,  the key feature of the Newtonian synthesis was  the law of universal gravitation. According to this law,  every body in the universe attracts every other body in the  universe in a precise mathematical relationship, whereby "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \f the force of attraction is proportional to the quantity of  matter of the objects and inversely proportional to the  square of the distance between them. The whole universe— from Kepler’s elliptical orbits to Galileo’s rolling  balls—was unified in one majestic system. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Causes of the Scientific Revolution "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The scientific revolution drew on long-term developments  in European culture. The first was the development of  the medieval university. By the thirteenth century permanent  universities with professors and large student bodies  had been established in western Europe to train the  lawyers, doctors, and church leaders society required. By  1300 philosophy had taken its place alongside law, medicine,  and theology. Medieval philosophers developed a  limited but real independence from theologians and a  sense of free inquiry. They nobly pursued a body of  knowledge and tried to arrange it meaningfully by means  of abstract theories. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Within this framework what we now think of as science  was able to emerge as a minor but distinct branch of philosophy.  In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries leading  universities established new professorships of mathematics,  astronomy, and physics (natural philosophy) within  their faculties of philosophy. Although the prestige of the  new fields was low, critical thinking was now applied to  scientific problems by a permanent community of scholars.  And an outlet existed for the talents of a Galileo or a  Newton: all the great pathfinders either studied or taught  at universities. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Second, the Renaissance also stimulated scientific progress.  The recovery of the finest works of Greek mathematics— a byproduct of Renaissance humanism’s ceaseless  search for the knowledge of antiquity—greatly improved  European mathematics. The recovery of more texts also  showed that classical mathematicians had their differences;  Europeans were thus forced to try to resolve these  ancient controversies by means of their own efforts. Finally,  Renaissance patrons, especially in Italy, often supported  scientists as well as artists and writers. Various  rulers and wealthy business people funded scientific investigations,  as the Medicis of Florence did for Galileo. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The navigational problems of long sea voyages in the  age of overseas expansion were a third factor in the scientific  revolution. Ship captains on distant shores needed  to be able to chart their positions as accurately as possible  so that reliable maps could be drawn and the risks of international  trade reduced. As early as 1484 the king of  Portugal appointed a commission of mathematicians to "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Scientific Revolution •  595 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" perfect tables to help seamen find their latitude. This resulted  in the first European navigation manual. Navigational  problems were also critical in the development of  many new scientific instruments, such as the telescope,  barometer, thermometer, pendulum clock, microscope,  and air pump. Better instruments, which permitted more  accurate observations, often led to important new knowledge.  Galileo with his telescope was by no means unique. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Better instruments were part of a fourth factor in the  scientific revolution: the development of better ways of  obtaining knowledge about the world. Two important  thinkers, Francis Bacon (1561–1626) and René Descartes  (1596–1650), represented key aspects of this improvement  in scientific methodology. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The English politician and writer Francis Bacon was  the greatest early propagandist for the new experimental  method. Rejecting the Aristotelian and medieval method  of using speculative reasoning to build general theories,  Bacon argued that new knowledge had to be pursued  through empirical experimental research. The researcher  who wants to learn more about leaves or rocks should  not speculate about the subject but should rather collect  a multitude of specimens and then compare and analyze  them, he said. General principles will then emerge.  Bacon’s contribution was to formalize the empirical  method, which had already been used by Brahe and Galileo,  into the general theory of inductive reasoning known  as empiricism. "}

Neither man’s extreme approach  was sufficient by itself. Bacon’s inability to appreciate  the importance of mathematics and his obsession  with practical results clearly showed the limitations of  antitheoretical empiricism. Likewise, some of Descartes’s  positions—he believed, for example, that it was possible  to deduce the whole science of medicine from first principles— demonstrated the inadequacy of rigid, dogmatic  rationalism. Thus the modern scientific method has  joined precise observations and experimentalism with the  search for general laws that may be expressed in rigorously  logical, mathematical language. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Finally, there is the question of the role of religion in  the development of science. Just as some historians have  argued that Protestantism led to the rise of capitalism,  others have concluded that Protestantism was a fundamental  factor in the rise of modern science. Protestantism,  particularly in its Calvinist varieties, supposedly made  scientific inquiry a question of individual conscience and  not of religious doctrine. The Catholic Church, in con"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" trast, supposedly suppressed scientific theories that conflicted  with its teachings and thus discouraged scientific  progress. The truth is more complicated. All Western  religious authorities—Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish—  opposed the Copernican system to a greater or lesser  extent until about 1630, by which time the scientific revolution  was definitely in progress. The Catholic Church  was initially less hostile than Protestant and Jewish religious  leaders, and Italian scientists played a crucial role  in scientific progress right up to the trial of Galileo in  1633. Thereafter, the Counter-Reformation church became  more hostile to science, a change that helped account  for the decline of science in Italy (but not in  Catholic France) after 1640. At the same time, Protestant  countries such as the Netherlands and Denmark became  quite “pro-science, especially countries that lacked a  strong religious authority capable of imposing religious  orthodoxy on scientific questions. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This was certainly the case with Protestant England  after 1630. English religious conflicts became so intense  that the authorities could not impose religious unity on  anything, including science. Significantly, the forerunners  of the Royal Society agreed to discuss only “neutral scientific  questions so as not to come to blows over closely  related religious and political disputes. The work of Bacon’s  many followers during Oliver Cromwell’s commonwealth  helped solidify the neutrality and independence of "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Science and Society "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The rise of modern science had many consequences, some  of which are still unfolding. First, it went hand in hand  with the rise of a new and expanding social group—the  international scientific community. Members of this  community were linked together by common interests  and shared values as well as by journals and the learned  scientific societies founded in many countries in the later  seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Expansion of  knowledge was the primary goal of this community, and  scientists’ material and psychological rewards depended  on their success in this endeavor. Thus science became  competitive, and even more scientific advance was inevitable.  Second, as governments intervened to support  and sometimes direct research, the new scientific community  became closely tied to the state and its agendas.  National academies of science were created under state  sponsorship in London in 1662, Paris in 1666, Berlin in  1700, and later across Europe. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Third, the scientific revolution introduced not only  new knowledge about nature but also a new and revolutionary  way of obtaining such knowledge—the modern  scientific method. In addition to being both theoretical  and experimental, this method was highly critical. It refused  to base its conclusions on tradition and established  sources, on ancient authorities and sacred texts. This critical  attitude to established authority would inspire thinkers  to question traditions in other domains as well. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Some things did not change in the scientific revolution.  New “rational methods for approaching nature  did not question traditional inequalities between the  sexes—and may have worsened them in some ways.  When Renaissance courts served as centers of learning,  talented noblewomen could find niches in study and research.  The rise of a professional scientific community  raised barriers for women because the new academies  that furnished professional credentials did not accept female  members. (This continued for a long time. Marie  Curie, the first person to win two Nobel prizes, was rejected  by the French Academy of Science in 1911 because  she was a woman.6) "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" The scientific revolution was the single most important  factor in the creation of the new worldview of the  eighteenth-century Enlightenment. This worldview, which  has played a large role in shaping the modern mind, grew  out of a rich mix of diverse and often conflicting ideas.  For the talented (and not-so-talented) writers who espoused  them, these ideas competed vigorously for the attention  of a growing public of well-educated but fickle  readers, who remained a minority of the population. Despite  the diversity, three central concepts stand at the  core of Enlightenment thinking. The most important  and original idea was that the methods of natural science  could and should be used to examine and understand all  aspects of life. This was what intellectuals meant by reason,  a favorite word of Enlightenment thinkers. Nothing  was to be accepted on faith. Everything was to be submitted  to rationalism, a secular, critical way of thinking.  A second important Enlightenment concept was that the  scientific method was capable of discovering the laws of  human society as well as those of nature. Thus was social  science born. Its birth led to the third key idea, that of "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" progress. Armed with the proper method of discovering  the laws of human existence, Enlightenment thinkers believed  that it was at least possible for human beings to  create better societies and better people. Their belief was  strengthened by some modest improvements in economic  and social life during the eighteenth century. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" • How did the new worldview affect the way people  thought about society and human relations?  The Emergence of the Enlightenment "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Loosely united by certain key ideas, the European Enlightenment  was a broad intellectual and cultural movement  that gained strength gradually and did not reach its  maturity until about 1750. Yet it was the generation that  came of age between the publication of Newton’s Principia  in 1687 and the death of Louis XIV in 1715 that  tied the crucial knot between the scientific revolution and  a new outlook on life. Talented writers of that generation  popularized hard-to-understand scientific achievements  for the educated elite. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The most famous and influential popularizer was a  versatile French man of letters, Bernard de Fontenelle  (1657–1757), who set out to make science witty and entertaining— as easy to read as a novel—for a broad nonscientific  audience. This was a tall order, but Fontenelle  largely succeeded. His most famous work, Conversations  on the Plurality of Worlds (1686), begins with two elegant  figures walking in the gathering shadows of a large park.  One is a woman, a sophisticated aristocrat, and the other  is her friend, perhaps even her lover. They gaze at the  stars, and their talk turns to a passionate discussion of . . .  astronomy! The man confides that “each star may well be  a different world, then gently stresses how error is giving  way to truth. At one point he explains: "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There came on the scene... one Copernicus, who made  short work of all those various circles, all those solid skies,  which the ancients had pictured to themselves....Fired  with the noble zeal of a true astronomer, he took the earth  and spun it very far away from the center of the universe,  where it had been installed, and in that center he put the sun,  which had a far better title to the honor.8 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Rather than despair at this dismissal of traditional understanding,  Fontenelle’s lady rejoices in the knowledge that  the human mind is capable of making great progress. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This concept of progress was essentially a creation of  the later seventeenth century. Medieval and Reformation  thinkers had been concerned primarily with sin and salvation.  The humanists of the Renaissance had empha"}

They had believed it might be possible to equal the magnificent  accomplishments of the ancients, but they did  not ask for more. Fontenelle and like-minded writers had  come to believe that, at least in science and mathematics,  their era had gone far beyond antiquity. Progress, at least  intellectual progress, was very possible. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The progressive and antireligious implications that  writers such as Fontenelle drew from the scientific revolution  reflected a very real crisis in European thought at  the end of the seventeenth century. This crisis had its  roots in several intellectual uncertainties and dissatisfactions,  of which the demolition of Aristotelian-medieval  science was only one. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A second uncertainty involved the whole question of  religious truth. The destructive wars of religion that culminated  in the Thirty Years’ War (1618–1648) had been  fought, in part, because religious freedom was an intolerable  idea in Europe in the early seventeenth century.  Both Catholics and Protestants had believed that religious  truth was absolute and therefore worth fighting  and dying for. Most Catholics and Protestants also believed  that a strong state required unity in religious faith.  Yet the disastrous results of the many attempts to impose  such religious unity, such as Louis XIV’s brutal expulsion  of the French Huguenots in 1685, led some people to  ask whether ideological conformity in religious matters  was really necessary. Others skeptically asked if religious  truth could ever be known with absolute certainty and  concluded that it could not. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" The Enlightenment • "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Fontenelle and other writers of his generation were also  instrumental in bringing science into conflict with religion.  This was a major innovation because many seventeenth- century scientists, both Catholic and Protestant, did not  draw antireligious implications from their scientific findings  and believed that their work exalted God. The greatest  scientist of them all, Isaac Newton, was a devout, if  unorthodox, Christian who saw all his studies as directed  toward explaining God’s message. Fontenelle, in contrast,  was skeptical about absolute truth and cynical about the  claims of organized religion. Since such unorthodox  views could not be stated openly in an absolute monarchy  like Louis XIV’s France, Fontenelle made his point  through subtle editorializing about science. His depiction  of the cautious Copernicus as a self-conscious revolutionary  was typical. In Eulogies of Scientists, Fontenelle  exploited with endless variations the fundamental theme  of rational, progressive scientists versus prejudiced, reactionary  priests. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" The rapidly growing travel literature on non-European  lands and cultures was a third cause of uncertainty. In the  wake of the great discoveries, Europeans were learning  that the peoples of China, India, Africa, and the Americas  all had their own very different beliefs and customs.  Europeans shaved their faces and let their hair grow.  Turks shaved their heads and let their beards grow. In  Europe a man bowed before a woman to show respect.  In Siam a man turned his back on a woman when he met  her because it was disrespectful to look directly at her.  Countless similar examples discussed in the travel accounts  helped change the perspective of educated Europeans.  They began to look at truth and morality in  relative, rather than absolute, terms. If anything was possible,  who could say what was right or wrong? "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A fourth cause and manifestation of European intellectual  turmoil was John Locke’s epoch-making Essay Concerning  Human Understanding. Published in 1690—the  same year Locke published his famous Second Treatise  of Civil Government (see page 548)—Locke’s essay brilliantly  set forth a new theory about how human beings  learn and form their ideas. In doing so, he rejected the  prevailing view of Descartes, who had held that all people  are born with certain basic ideas and ways of thinking.  Locke insisted that all ideas are derived from experience.  The human mind at birth is like a blank tablet, or tabula  rasa, on which the environment writes the individual’s  understanding and beliefs. Human development is therefore  determined by education and social institutions, for  good or for evil. Locke’s Essay Concerning Human Understanding  passed through many editions and translations.  Along with Newton’s Principia, it was one of the  dominant intellectual inspirations of the Enlightenment. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Philosophes and the Public "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" By the time Louis XIV died in 1715, many of the ideas  that would soon coalesce into the new worldview had  been assembled. Yet Christian Europe was still strongly  attached to its traditional beliefs, as witnessed by the  powerful revival of religious orthodoxy in the first half of  the eighteenth century (see pages 672–673). By the outbreak  of the American Revolution in 1775, however, a  large portion of western Europe’s educated elite had embraced  many of the new ideas. This acceptance was the  work of one of history’s most influential groups of intellectuals,  the philosophes. It was the philosophes who "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" proudly proclaimed that they, at long last, were bringing  the light of knowledge to their ignorant fellow creatures  in an Age of Enlightenment. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Philosophe is the French word for “philosopher, and  it was in France that the Enlightenment reached its highest  development. There were at least three reasons for  this. First, French was the international language of the  educated classes in the eighteenth century, and the education  of the rich and the powerful across Europe often  lay in the hands of French tutors espousing Enlightenment  ideas. France’s cultural leadership was reinforced by  the fact that it was still the wealthiest and most populous  country in Europe. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Second, after the death of Louis XIV, French absolutism  and religious orthodoxy remained strong, but  not too strong. Critical books were often banned by the  censors, and their authors were sometimes jailed or exiled— but they were not tortured or burned. Intellectual  radicals battled against powerful opposition in France,  but they did not face the overwhelming restraints generally  found in eastern and east-central Europe. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Third, the French philosophes were indeed philosophers,  asking fundamental philosophical questions about  the meaning of life, God, human nature, good and evil,  and cause and effect. But in the tradition of Bayle and  Fontenelle, they were not content with abstract arguments  or ivory-tower speculations. They were determined  to reach and influence all the French (and European) economic  and social elites, many of which were joined together  in the eighteenth-century concept of the “republic  of letters, an imaginary, transnational realm constituted  by all members of the educated or enlightened public. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Suspicious of the people but intensely committed to  reason, reform, and slow, difficult progress, the great  philosophes and their imitators were not free to write as  they wished, since it was illegal in France to openly criticize  either church or state. Their most radical works had  to circulate in manuscript form. Knowing that direct attacks  would probably be banned or burned, the philosophes  wrote novels and plays, histories and philosophies,  dictionaries and encyclopedias, all filled with satire and  double meanings to spread their message to the public.  One of the greatest philosophes, the baron de Montesquieu  (1689–1755), brilliantly pioneered this approach  in The Persian Letters, an extremely influential social satire  published in 1721. This work consisted of amusing letters  supposedly written by two Persian travelers, Usbek  and Rica, who see European customs in unique ways and  thereby allow Montesquieu to cleverly criticize existing  practices and beliefs. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \f The Enlightenment •  601 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Like many Enlightenment philosophes, Montesquieu  saw relations between men and women as particularly  representative of overall social and political systems. He  used the oppression of women in the Persian harem,  described in letters from Usbek’s wives, to symbolize  Eastern political tyranny. At the end of the book, the rebellion  of Usbek’s harem against the cruel eunuchs he  left in charge of them demonstrates that despotism must  ultimately fail. Montesquieu also uses the Persians’ observations  of habitual infidelity among French wives and  the strength of female power behind the throne to poke  fun at European social and political customs. As Rica  remarks: "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The thing is that, for every man who has any post at court, in  Paris, or in the country, there is a woman through whose  hands pass all the favours and sometimes the injustices that  he does. These women are all in touch with one another, and  compose a sort of commonwealth whose members are always  busy giving each other mutual help and support. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Montesquieu was exaggerating, but he echoed other critics  of the informal power women gained in an absolutist  system, where royal mistresses and female courtiers could  have more access to the king than government ministers. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Having gained fame by using wit as a weapon against  cruelty and superstition, Montesquieu settled down on  his family estate to study history and politics. His interest  was partly personal, for, like many members of the  French robe nobility, he was disturbed by the growth in  royal absolutism under Louis XIV. But Montesquieu was  also inspired by the example of the physical sciences, and  he set out to apply the critical method to the problem of  government in The Spirit of Laws (1748). The result was  a complex comparative study of republics, monarchies,  and despotisms—a great pioneering inquiry in the emerging  social sciences. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Showing that forms of government were shaped by  history, geography, and customs, Montesquieu focused  on the conditions that would promote liberty and prevent  tyranny. He argued that despotism could be avoided  if there was a separation of powers, with political power  divided and shared by a variety of classes and legal estates  holding unequal rights and privileges. A strong, independent  upper class was especially important, according  to Montesquieu, because in order to prevent the abuse of  power “it is necessary that by the arrangement of things,  power checks power. Admiring greatly the English balance  of power among the king, the houses of Parliament,  and the independent courts, Montesquieu believed that  in France the thirteen high courts—the parlements—were "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Primary Source: Montesquieu Identifies the Necessity  for the Separation of Governmental Powers "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The most famous and in many ways most representative  philosophe was François Marie Arouet, who was  known by the pen name Voltaire (1694–1778). In his  long career, this son of a comfortable middle-class family  wrote more than seventy witty volumes, hobnobbed  with kings and queens, and died a millionaire because of  shrewd business speculations. His early career, however,  was turbulent. In 1717 Voltaire was imprisoned for eleven  months in the Bastille in Paris for insulting the regent of  France. In 1726 a barb from his sharp tongue led a great  French nobleman to have him beaten and arrested. This  experience made a deep impression on Voltaire. All his  life he struggled against legal injustice and unequal treatment  before the law. Released from prison after promising  to leave the country, Voltaire lived in England for  three years and came to share Montesquieu’s enthusiasm  for English institutions. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Returning to France and soon threatened again with  prison in Paris, Voltaire had the great fortune of meeting  Gabrielle-Emilie Le Tonnelier de Breteuil, marquise du  Châtelet (1706–1749), an intellectually gifted woman  from the high aristocracy with a passion for science.

I would make women participate in all  the rights of humankind, and above all in those of the  intellect.9 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" While living at Cirey, Voltaire wrote various works  praising England and popularizing English scientific  progress. Newton, he wrote, was history’s greatest man,  for he had used his genius for the benefit of humanity. “It  is, wrote Voltaire, “the man who sways our minds by the  prevalence of reason and the native force of truth, not  they who reduce mankind to a state of slavery by force  and downright violence . . . that claims our reverence and  admiration.10 In the true style of the Enlightenment,  Voltaire mixed the glorification of science and reason with  an appeal for better individuals and institutions. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Yet like almost all of the philosophes, Voltaire was a reformer,  not a revolutionary, in social and political matters.  He was eventually appointed royal historian in 1743, and  his Age of Louis XIV portrayed Louis as the dignified  leader of his age. Voltaire also began a long correspondence  with Frederick the Great and, after the death of his  beloved Emilie, accepted Frederick’s invitation to come  brighten up the Prussian court in Berlin. The two men  later quarreled, but Voltaire always admired Frederick as  a free thinker and an enlightened monarch. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Unlike Montesquieu, Voltaire pessimistically concluded  that the best one could hope for in the way of  government was a good monarch, since human beings  “are very rarely worthy to govern themselves. Nor did  he believe in social and economic equality in human affairs.  The idea of making servants equal to their masters  was “absurd and impossible. The only realizable equality,  Voltaire thought, was that “by which the citizen only  depends on the laws which protect the freedom of the  feeble against the ambitions of the strong.11 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Voltaire’s philosophical and religious positions were  much more radical. In the tradition of Bayle, his voluminous  writings challenged, often indirectly, the Catholic  Church and Christian theology at almost every point.  Though he was considered by many devout Christians to  be a shallow blasphemer, Voltaire’s religious views were  ambiguous and quite typical of the complex attitudes  toward religion held by Enlightenment thinkers. Voltaire  clearly believed in God, but his was a distant, deistic God,  the great Clockmaker who built an orderly universe and  then stepped aside and let it run. Above all, Voltaire and  most of the philosophes hated all forms of religious intolerance,  which they believed often led to fanaticism and  savage, inhuman action. Simple piety and human kindness— as embodied in Christ’s great commandments to  “love God and your neighbor as yourself —were religion  enough, as may be seen in Voltaire’s famous essay  on religion. (See the feature “Listening to the Past:  Voltaire on Religion on pages 618–619.) "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The ultimate strength of the French philosophes lay in  their number, dedication, and organization. The philosophes  felt keenly that they were engaged in a common  undertaking that transcended individuals. Their greatest  and most representative intellectual achievement was,  quite fittingly, a group effort—the seventeen-volume Encyclopedia:  The Rational Dictionary of the Sciences, the  Arts, and the Crafts, edited by Denis Diderot (1713–1784)  and Jean le Rond d’Alembert (1717–1783). They were  a curious pair. Diderot began his career as a hack writer,  first attracting attention with a skeptical tract on religion  that was quickly burned by the judges of Paris. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \f D’Alembert was one of Europe’s leading scientists and  mathematicians, the orphaned and illegitimate son of celebrated  aristocrats. From different circles and with different  interests, the two men set out to find coauthors who  would examine the rapidly expanding whole of human  knowledge. Even more fundamentally, they set out to  teach people how to think critically and objectively about  all matters. As Diderot said, he wanted the Encyclopedia  to “change the general way of thinking.12 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The editors of the Encyclopedia had to conquer innumerable  obstacles. After the appearance in 1751 of the  first volume, which dealt with such controversial subjects  as atheism, the soul, and blind people (all words beginning  with a in French), the government temporarily  banned publication. The pope later placed the work on  the Catholic Church’s index of forbidden works and pronounced  excommunication on all who read or bought it.  In an attempt to appease the authorities, the timid publisher  watered down some of the articles in the last ten  volumes without the editors’ consent. Yet Diderot’s unwavering  belief in the importance of his mission held the  encyclopedists together for fifteen years, and the enormous  work was completed in 1765. Hundreds of thousands  of articles by leading scientists, famous writers,  skilled workers, and progressive priests treated every aspect  of life and knowledge. "}

Science and  the industrial arts were exalted, religion and immortality  questioned. Intolerance, legal injustice, and out-of-date  social institutions were openly criticized.

The encyclopedists were convinced  that greater knowledge would result in greater human  happiness, for knowledge was useful and made possible  economic, social, and political progress. The Encyclopedia  was widely read, especially in less-expensive reprint  editions published in Switzerland, and it was extremely  influential in France and throughout western Europe as  well. It summed up the new worldview of the Enlightenment. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Different areas followed different strands of Enlightenment  thinking. In England and Germany, scholars have  described a more conservative Enlightenment that tried  to integrate the findings of the scientific revolution with  religious faith and practices. After the Act of Union with  England and Ireland in 1707, Scotland was freed from  political crisis to experience a vigorous period of intellectual  growth. The Scottish Enlightenment, centered in  Edinburgh, was marked by an emphasis on pragmatic and  scientific reasoning. Intellectual revival was stimulated by  the creation of the first public educational system in Europe.  The most important figure in Edinburgh was David  Hume (1711–1776), whose carefully argued religious  skepticism had a powerful impact at home and abroad. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Building on Locke’s teachings on learning, Hume argued  that the human mind is really nothing but a bundle  of impressions. These impressions originate only in sense  experiences and our habits of joining these experiences  together. Since our ideas ultimately reflect only our sense  experiences, our reason cannot tell us anything about  questions that cannot be verified by sense experience (in  the form of controlled experiments or mathematics), such  as the origin of the universe or the existence of God. Paradoxically,  Hume’s rationalistic inquiry ended up undermining  the Enlightenment’s faith in the power of reason. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Urban Culture and the Public Sphere "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Enlightenment ideas did not float on air. A series of new  institutions and practices emerged in the late seventeenth  and eighteenth centuries to facilitate the spread of Enlightenment  ideas. First, the European production and  consumption of books grew dramatically in the eighteenth  century. In Germany the number of new titles  appearing annually grew substantially, from roughly six  hundred new titles in 1700 to about eleven hundred in  1764 and about twenty-six hundred in 1780. France also  witnessed an explosive growth in book consumption.  The number of books in the hands of elite readers increased  eightfold to tenfold between the 1690s and the  1780s, when the private library of the typical noble contained  more than three hundred volumes. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Moreover, the types of books people read changed  dramatically. The proportion of religious and devotional  books published in Paris declined precipitously, from  one-half of the total in the 1690s to one-tenth of the total  in the 1780s. History and law held constant, while the  proportion of published books treating the arts and sciences  surged. "}

"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The illegal book trade in France also featured an astonishing  growth of scandalmongering denunciations of  high political figures and frankly pornographic works.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Reading more books on many more subjects, the educated  public in France and throughout Europe increasingly  approached reading in a new way. The result was  what some scholars have called a reading revolution.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Conversation, discussion, and debate also played a critical  role in the Enlightenment. Paris set the example, and  other French and European cities followed. In Paris a  number of talented, wealthy women presided over regular  social gatherings of the great and near-great in their  elegant private drawing rooms, or salons.

Elite women lacked many  rights, but so did most men. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" One of the most famous salons was that of Madame  Geoffrin, the unofficial godmother of the Encyclopedia.  Having lost her parents at an early age, she was married  at fifteen by her well-meaning grandmother to a rich  and boring businessman of forty-eight. After dutifully  raising her children, Madame Geoffrin broke out of her  gilded cage. With the aid of an aristocratic neighbor and  in spite of her husband’s loud protests, she developed a  twice-weekly salon that counted Fontenelle and Montesquieu  among its regular guests. Inheriting a large fortune  after her husband’s death, Madame Geoffrin gave  the encyclopedists generous financial aid and helped save "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" The salon also provided an informal apprenticeship  for younger women who aspired to lead salons of their  own. One such woman was Julie de Lespinasse. Eventually  forming her own highly informal salon and attracting  the keenest minds in France and Europe, Lespinasse epitomized  the skills of the Enlightenment hostess. As one  philosophe wrote: "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" She could unite the different types, even the most antagonistic,  sustaining the conversation by a well-aimed phrase,  animating and guiding it at will....Politics, religion, philosophy,  news: nothing was excluded. Her circle met daily  from five to nine. There one found men of all ranks in the  State, the Church, and the Court, soldiers and foreigners,  and the leading writers of the day.14 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \f As this passage suggests, the salons created a cultural  realm free from religious dogma and political censorship.  There a diverse but educated public could debate issues  and form its own ideas. Through their invitation lists, salon  hostesses brought together members of the intellectual,  economic, and social elites. In such an atmosphere,  the philosophes, the French nobility, and the prosperous  middle classes intermingled and influenced one another.  Thinking critically about almost any question became  fashionable and flourished alongside hopes for human  progress through greater knowledge and enlightened  public opinion. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Membership at the salons was restricted to the well- born, the well-connected, and the exceptionally talented.  A number of institutions emerged for those who aspired  to follow, rather than lead, the Enlightenment. Lending  libraries served an important function for people who  could not afford to buy their own books. The coffeehouses  that first appeared in the late seventeenth century  became meccas of philosophical discussion. Then, as  now, one could linger for hours to read or debate for the  price of a cup of coffee. In addition to these institutions,  book clubs, Masonic lodges, and journals all played roles  in the creation of a new public sphere that celebrated  open debate informed by critical reason. The public  sphere was an idealized space where members of society  came together as individuals to discuss issues relevant to  the society, economics, and politics of the day. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What of the common people? Did they participate  in the Enlightenment? Enlightenment philosophes did  not direct their message to peasants or urban laborers.  Whether of middling or noble origin, intellectuals sought  patronage from the wealthy and powerful. They believed  that the masses had no time or talent for philosophical  speculation and that elevating them would be a long,  slow, potentially dangerous process. Deluded by superstitions  and driven by violent passions, they thought, the  people were like little children in need of firm parental  guidance. French philosophe d’Alembert characteristically  made a sharp distinction between “the truly enlightened  public and “the blind and noisy multitude.15 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There is some evidence, however, that the people were  not immune to the words of the philosophes. At a time  of rising literacy, book prices were dropping in cities and  towns, and many philosophical ideas were popularized in  cheap pamphlets. Moreover, even illiterate people had  access to written material, through the practice of public  reading. The Parisian glass-worker Jacques-Louis Ménétra,  whose education consisted of a few years of schooling  and his trade apprenticeship, claimed in his autobiography  to have cultivated a friendship with Jean-Jacques "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Late Enlightenment "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" After about 1770 a number of thinkers and writers began  to attack the Enlightenment’s faith in reason, progress,  and moderation. The most famous of these was the Swiss  Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712–1778), a brilliant and difficult  thinker and an appealing but neurotic individual.  Born into a poor family of watchmakers in Geneva,  Rousseau went to Paris and was greatly influenced by  Diderot and Voltaire. Always extraordinarily sensitive  and suspicious, he came to believe that his philosophe  friends and the women of the Parisian salons were plotting  against him. In the mid-1750s he broke with them  personally and intellectually, living thereafter as a lonely  outsider with his uneducated common-law wife and going  in his own highly original direction. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Like other Enlightenment thinkers, Rousseau was passionately  committed to individual freedom. Unlike them,  however, he attacked rationalism and civilization as destroying,  rather than liberating, the individual. Warm,  spontaneous feeling had to complement and correct cold  intellect. Moreover, the basic goodness of the individual  and the unspoiled child had to be protected from the  cruel refinements of civilization. Rousseau’s ideals greatly  influenced the early romantic movement (see pages 660–  661), which rebelled against the culture of the Enlightenment  in the late eighteenth century. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Reconfirming Montesquieu’s critique of women’s influence  in public affairs, Rousseau called for a rigid division  of gender roles. According to Rousseau, women and  men were radically different beings. Destined by nature  to assume a passive role in sexual relations, women  should also be passive in social life. A woman’s role was  to care for her children at home and to please her husband  with good housekeeping, a modest demeanor, and  a fresh, natural appearance. Women’s passion for fashion,  attending salons, and pulling the strings of power was  unnatural and had a corrupting effect on both politics  and society. Rousseau thus rejected the sophisticated way  of life of elite Parisian women. Against them, he rearticulated  conventional stereotypes as a form of natural law,  against which debate was impossible. These views had a  strong impact on both men and women in the late eighteenth  century, contributing to calls for privileged women  to abandon their stylish corsets and to breast-feed their  children. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \f 608 CHAPTER 18 •  TOWARD A NEW WORLDVIEW, 1540–1789 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Rousseau’s contribution to political theory in The  Social Contract (1762) was equally significant. His contribution  was based on two fundamental concepts: the  general will and popular sovereignty. According to Rousseau,  the general will is sacred and absolute, reflecting  the common interests of all the people, who have displaced  the monarch as the holder of sovereign power.  The general will is not necessarily the will of the majority,  however. At times the general will may be the authentic,  long-term needs of the people as correctly interpreted by  a farseeing minority. Little noticed before the French  Revolution, Rousseau’s concept of the general will appealed  greatly to democrats and nationalists after 1789.  (The concept has since been used by many dictators who  have claimed that they, rather than some momentary majority  of the voters, represent the general will.) Rousseau  was both one of the most influential voices of the Enlightenment  and, in his rejection of rationalism and social  discourse, a harbinger of reaction against Enlightenment  ideas. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Primary Source: Rousseau Espouses Popular  Sovereignty and the General Will "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As the reading public developed, it joined forces with  the philosophes to call for the autonomy of the printed  word. Immanuel Kant (1724–1804), a professor in East  Prussia and the greatest German philosopher of his day,  posed the question of the age when he published a pamphlet  in 1784 entitled What Is Enlightenment? Kant answered,  “Sapere Aude! [dare to know] Have courage to  use your own understanding!—that is the motto of enlightenment.  He argued that if serious thinkers were  granted the freedom to exercise their reason publicly in  print, enlightenment would almost surely follow. Kant  was no revolutionary; he also insisted that in their private  lives, individuals must obey all laws, no matter how unreasonable,  and should be punished for “impertinent  criticism. Kant thus tried to reconcile absolute monarchical  authority with a critical public sphere. This balancing  act characterized experiments with “enlightened absolutism  in the eighteenth century. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Race and the Enlightenment "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In addition to criticizing their own societies and political  systems, Enlightenment thinkers wrote about society and  human nature outside their borders. In recent years, historians  have found in the scientific revolution and the  Enlightenment a crucial turning point in European ideas  about race. Many of the most important thinkers of the "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Enlightenment devoted substantial attention to comparisons  of European and non-European cultures, deriving  their understanding of people at home from differences  with people abroad. The result was the formation of  highly influential new understandings of racial difference.  As with other strands of Enlightenment thought,  the new scientific method, and its apparently neutral, rational  thinking, provided intellectual legitimacy for their  findings. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A primary catalyst for new ideas about race was the  urge to classify nature unleashed by the scientific revolution’s  insistence on careful empirical observation. In The  System of Nature (1735) Swedish botanist Carl von Linné  argued that nature was organized into a God-given hierarchy,  which mankind must uncover and chart meticulously.  As scientists developed more elaborate  taxonomies of plant and animal species, they also began  to classify humans into hierarchically ordered “races and  to investigate the origins of race. The Comte de Buffon  argued that humans originated with one species that  then developed into distinct races due largely to climactic  conditions. In A Natural History he describes experiments  conducted on African bodies to determine the  cause of their “blackness, which was assumed to be an  acquired variation from humans’ originally white skin. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Using the word race to designate biologically distinct  groups of humans, akin to distinct animal species, was  new. Previously, Europeans grouped other peoples into  “nations based on their historical, political, and cultural  affiliations, rather than on supposedly innate physical differences.  Unsurprisingly, when European thinkers drew  up a hierarchical classification of human species, their own  “race was placed at the top. Europeans had long believed  they were culturally superior to “barbaric peoples  in Africa and, since 1492, the New World. Now emerging  ideas about racial difference taught them they were  biologically superior as well. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Enlightenment thinkers such as David Hume and Immanuel  Kant helped popularize these ideas. In Of Natural  Characters (1748), Hume wrote: "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" I am apt to suspect the negroes and in general all other  species of men (for there are four or five different kinds) to be  naturally inferior to the whites. There never was a civilized  nation of any other complexion than white, nor even any individual  eminent amongst them, no arts, no sciences....  Such a uniform and constant difference could not happen, in  so many countries and ages if nature had not made an original  distinction between these breeds of men.16 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Prussian philosopher Immanuel Kant taught and  wrote as much about “anthropology and “geography "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \f as he did about standard philosophical themes such as  logic, metaphysics, and moral philosophy. He shared and  elaborated Hume’s views about race in On the Different  Races of Man (1775), claiming that there were four human  races, each of which had derived from an original  race of “white brunette people. According to Kant, the  closest descendants of the original race were the white  inhabitants of northern Germany. In deriving new physical  characteristics, the other races had degenerated both  physically and culturally from this origin. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" These ideas did not go unchallenged. James Beattie responded  directly to Hume’s claims of white superiority by  pointing out that Europeans had started out as savage as  nonwhites and that many non-European peoples in the  Americas, Asia, and Africa had achieved high levels of civilization.  Johann von Herder criticized Kant, arguing that  humans could not be classified into races based on skin  color and that each culture was as intrinsically worthy as  any other. These challenges to emerging scientific notions  of racial inequality, however, were in the minority. Many  other Enlightenment voices agreeing with Kant and  Hume—Thomas Jefferson among them—may be found. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Scholars are only at the beginning of efforts to understand  links between Enlightenment ideas about race and  its notions of equality, progress, and reason. There are  clear parallels, though, between the use of science to  propagate racial hierarchies and its use to defend social  inequalities between men and women. As Rousseau used  women’s “natural passivity to argue for their passive role  in society, so a Hume and a Kant used non-Europeans’  “natural inferiority to defend slavery and colonial domination.  The new powers of science and reason were thus  marshaled to imbue traditional stereotypes with the force  of natural law. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Enlightenment"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" and Absolutism "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" How did the Enlightenment influence political developments?  To this important question there is no easy answer.  Most Enlightenment thinkers outside of England  and the Netherlands believed that political change could  best come from above—from the ruler—rather than  from below, especially in central and eastern Europe.  Royal absolutism was a fact of life, and the kings and  queens of Europe’s leading states clearly had no intention  of giving up their great power. Therefore, the  philosophes and their sympathizers realistically concluded  that a benevolent absolutism offered the best opportunities  for improving society. Critical thinking was "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" turning the art of good government into an exact science.  It was necessary to educate and “enlighten the  monarch, who could then make good laws and promote  human happiness. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The philosophes’ influence was heightened by the fact  that many government officials were attracted to and interested  in philosophical ideas. They were among the  best-educated and best-informed members of society,  and their daily involvement in complex affairs of state  made them naturally interested in ideas for improving or  reforming human society. Encouraged and instructed by  these officials, some absolutist rulers of the later eighteenth  century tried to govern in an “enlightened manner.  Yet the actual programs and accomplishments of  these rulers varied greatly. It is necessary to examine the  evolution of monarchical absolutism at close range before  trying to judge the Enlightenment’s effect and the  meaning of what historians have often called the enlightened  absolutism of the later eighteenth century. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Enlightenment teachings inspired European rulers in  small as well as large states in the second half of the  eighteenth century. Absolutist princes and monarchs in  several west German and Italian states, as well as in Scandinavia,  Spain, and Portugal, proclaimed themselves more  enlightened. A few smaller states were actually the most  successful in making reforms, perhaps because their rulers  were not overwhelmed by the size and complexity of their  realms. Denmark, for example, carried out extensive and  progressive land reform in the 1780s that practically abolished  serfdom and gave Danish peasants secure tenure on  their farms. Yet by far the most influential of the new- style monarchs were in Prussia, Russia, and Austria, and  they deserve primary attention. "}

Rejecting the crude life of the barracks, Frederick  embraced culture and literature, even writing poetry  and fine prose in French, a language his father  detested.

{"prompt":"","completion":" youths, Frederick eventually reconciled with his father,  and by the time he came to the throne ten years later  Frederick was determined to use the splendid army that  his father had left him. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Therefore, when the ruler of Austria, Charles VI, also  died in 1740 and his young and charismatic daughter  Maria Theresa inherited the Habsburg dominions, Frederick  suddenly and without warning invaded her rich,  mainly German province of Silesia. This action defied  solemn Prussian promises to respect the Pragmatic Sanction,  which guaranteed Maria Theresa’s succession.  Maria Theresa’s disunited army was no match for Prussian  precision; in 1742, as other greedy powers were  falling on her lands in the general European War of the  Austrian Succession (1740–1748), she was forced to  cede almost all of Silesia to Prussia (see Map 17.2 on  page 570). In one stroke Prussia had doubled its population  to six million people. Now Prussia unquestionably  towered above all the other German states and stood as a  European Great Power. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Though successful in 1742, Frederick had to spend  much of his reign fighting against great odds to save  Prussia from total destruction. Maria Theresa was determined  to regain Silesia, and when the ongoing competition  between Britain and France for colonial empire  brought another great conflict in 1756 (see page 635),  Austria fashioned an aggressive alliance with France and  Russia. During the Seven Years’ War (1756–1763), the  aim of the alliance was to conquer Prussia and divide up  its territory. Frederick led his army brilliantly, striking repeatedly  at vastly superior forces invading from all sides.  At times he believed all was lost, but he fought on with  stoic courage. In the end he was miraculously saved: Peter  III came to the Russian throne in 1762 and called off  the attack against Frederick, whom he greatly admired. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the early years of his reign Frederick II had kept his  enthusiasm for Enlightenment culture strictly separated  from a brutal concept of international politics. He wrote: "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Of all States, from the smallest to the biggest, one can safely  say that the fundamental rule of government is the principle of  extending their territories....The passions of rulers have no  other curb but the limits of their power. Those are the fixed  laws of European politics to which every politician submits.17 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But the terrible struggle of the Seven Years’ War tempered  Frederick and brought him to consider how more humane  policies for his subjects might also strengthen the  state. Thus Frederick went beyond a superficial commitment  to Enlightenment culture for himself and his circle.  He tolerantly allowed his subjects to believe as they  wished in religious and philosophical matters. He pro"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" moted the advancement of knowledge, improving his  country’s schools and permitting scholars to publish their  findings. Moreover, Frederick tried to improve the lives of  his subjects more directly. As he wrote his friend Voltaire,  “I must enlighten my people, cultivate their manners and  morals, and make them as happy as human beings can be,  or as happy as the means at my disposal permit. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The legal system and the bureaucracy were Frederick’s  primary tools. Prussia’s laws were simplified, torture of  prisoners was abolished, and judges decided cases quickly  and impartially. Prussian officials became famous for their  hard work and honesty. After the Seven Years’ War ended  in 1763, Frederick’s government energetically promoted  the reconstruction of agriculture and industry in his war- torn country. Frederick himself set a good example. He  worked hard and lived modestly, claiming that he was  “only the first servant of the state. Thus Frederick justified  monarchy in terms of practical results and said nothing  of the divine right of kings. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Frederick’s dedication to high-minded government  went only so far, however. He never tried to change Prussia’s  existing social structure. True, he condemned serfdom  in the abstract, but he accepted it in practice and did  not even free the serfs on his own estates. He accepted  and extended the privileges of the nobility, which he saw  as his primary ally in the defense and extension of his  realm. The Junker nobility remained the backbone of the  army and the entire Prussian state. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Nor did Frederick listen to thinkers like Moses Mendelssohn  (1729–1786), who urged that Jews be given  freedom and civil rights. (See the feature “Individuals in  Society: Moses Mendelssohn and the Jewish Enlightenment.)  As in other German states, Jews in Prussia remained  an oppressed group. The vast majority were  confined to tiny, overcrowded ghettos, were excluded by  law from most business and professional activities, and  could be ordered out of the kingdom at a moment’s notice.  A very few Jews in Prussia did manage to succeed  and to obtain the right of permanent settlement, usually  by performing some special service for the state.

The watchman laughed and  waved him through. “Go Moses, the sea has opened  before you.* Embracing the Enlightenment and seeking  a revitalization of Jewish religious thought, Moses  Mendelssohn did point his people in a new and uncharted  direction. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Turning in Berlin to a learned rabbi he had previously  known in Dessau, the young Mendelssohn studied  Jewish law and eked out a living copying Hebrew  manuscripts in a beautiful hand. But he was soon  fascinated by an intellectual world that had been closed  to him in the Dessau ghetto. There, like most Jews  throughout central Europe, he had spoken Yiddish—  a mixture of German, Polish, and Hebrew. Now, working  mainly on his own, he mastered German; learned  Latin, Greek, French, and English; and studied mathematics  and Enlightenment philosophy. Word of his  exceptional abilities spread in Berlin’s Jewish community  (1,500 of the city’s 100,000 inhabitants). He  began tutoring the children of a wealthy Jewish silk  merchant, and he soon became the merchant’s clerk  and later his partner. But his great passion remained  the life of the mind and the spirit, which he avidly  pursued in his off hours. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" her mother was related to the Romanovs of Russia, and  that proved to be Catherine’s chance. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Peter the Great had abolished the hereditary succession  of tsars so that he could name his successor and thus  preserve his policies. This move opened a period of palace  intrigue and a rapid turnover of rulers until Peter’s  youngest daughter, Elizabeth, came to the Russian throne  in 1741. A shrewd but crude woman, Elizabeth named  her nephew Peter heir to the throne and chose Catherine  to be his wife in 1744. It was a mismatch from the beginning.  The fifteen-year-old Catherine was intelligent  and attractive; her husband shared neither of these qualities.  Ignored by her husband, Catherine carefully studied  Russian, endlessly read writers such as Bayle and  Voltaire, and made friends at court. Soon she knew what  she wanted: “I did not care about Peter, she wrote in  her Memoirs, “but I did care about the crown.18 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As the old empress Elizabeth approached death, Catherine  plotted against her unpopular husband. She selected  as her new lover a dashing young officer named Grigory  Orlov, who with his four officer brothers commanded  considerable support among the soldiers stationed in  St. Petersburg. When Peter came to the throne in 1762,  his decision to withdraw Russian troops from the coalition  against Prussia alienated the army. At the end of six  months Catherine and her conspirators deposed Peter III  in a palace revolution, and the Orlov brothers murdered  him. The German princess became empress of Russia. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Catherine had drunk deeply at the Enlightenment well.  Never questioning the common assumption that absolute  monarchy was the best form of government, she set out  to rule in an enlightened manner. She had three main  goals. First, she worked hard to continue Peter the  Great’s effort to bring the culture of western Europe to "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \f backward Russia. To do so, she imported Western architects,  sculptors, musicians, and intellectuals. She bought  masterpieces of Western art in wholesale lots and patronized  the philosophes. An enthusiastic letter writer, she  corresponded extensively with Voltaire and praised him  as the “champion of the human race. When the French  government banned the Encyclopedia, she offered to publish  it in St. Petersburg, and she sent money to Diderot  when he needed it. With these and countless similar actions,  Catherine won good press in the West for herself  and for her country. Moreover, this intellectual ruler,  who wrote plays and loved good talk, set the tone for the  entire Russian nobility. Peter the Great westernized Russian  armies, but it was Catherine who westernized the  imagination of the Russian nobility. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Catherine’s second goal was domestic reform, and she  began her reign with sincere and ambitious projects. Better  laws were a major concern. In 1767 she appointed a  special legislative commission to prepare a new law code.  No new unified code was ever produced, but Catherine  did restrict the practice of torture and allowed limited religious  toleration. She also tried to improve education  and strengthen local government. The philosophes applauded  these measures and hoped more would follow. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Primary Source: Catherine the Great’s Grand Instruction  to the Legislative Commission "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Such was not the case. In 1773 a common Cossack  soldier named Emelian Pugachev sparked a gigantic uprising  of serfs, very much as Stenka Razin had done a  century earlier (see page 576). Proclaiming himself the  true tsar, Pugachev issued “decrees abolishing serfdom,  taxes, and army service. Thousands joined his cause,  slaughtering landlords and officials over a vast area of  southwestern Russia. Pugachev’s untrained forces eventually  proved no match for Catherine’s noble-led regular  army. Betrayed by his own company, Pugachev was captured  and savagely executed. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Pugachev’s rebellion was a decisive turning point in  Catherine’s domestic policy. On coming to the throne,  she had condemned serfdom in theory, but Pugachev’s  rebellion put an end to any intentions she might have had  about reforming the system. The peasants were clearly  dangerous, and her empire rested on the support of the  nobility. After 1775 Catherine gave the nobles absolute  control of their serfs. She extended serfdom into new areas,  such as Ukraine. In 1785 she formalized the nobility’s  privileged position, freeing nobles forever from taxes  and state service. Under Catherine the Russian nobility "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Catherine’s third goal was territorial expansion, and in  this respect she was extremely successful. Her armies subjugated  the last descendants of the Mongols, the Crimean  Tatars, and began the conquest of the Caucasus.  Her greatest coup by far was the partition of Poland (see  Map 18.1). By 1700 Poland had become a weak and decentralized  republic with an elected king (see page 567),  and Poland’s fate in the late eighteenth century demonstrated  the dangers of failing to build a strong absolutist  state. All important decisions continued to require the  unanimous agreement of all nobles elected to the Polish  Diet, which meant that nothing could ever be done to  strengthen the state. When, between 1768 and 1772,  Catherine’s armies scored unprecedented victories against  the Turks and thereby threatened to disturb the balance  of power between Russia and Austria in eastern Europe,  Frederick of Prussia obligingly came forward with a deal.  He proposed that Turkey be let off easily and that Prussia,  Austria, and Russia each compensate itself by taking a  gigantic slice of Polish territory. Catherine jumped at the  chance. The first partition of Poland took place in 1772.  Two more partitions, in 1793 and 1795, gave all three  powers more Polish territory, and the ancient republic of  Poland vanished from the map. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Expansion helped Catherine keep the nobility happy,  for it provided her with vast new lands to give to her  faithful servants. Until the end this remarkable woman—  who always believed that, in spite of her domestic setbacks,  she was slowly civilizing Russia—kept her zest for  life. Fascinated by a new twenty-two-year-old flame when  she was a grandmother in her sixties, she happily reported  her good fortune to a favorite former lover: “I have come  back to life like a frozen fly; I am gay and well.19 "}

He granted religious toleration and civic rights to Protestants  and Jews—a radical innovation that impressed his  contemporaries. In even more spectacular peasant reforms,  Joseph abolished serfdom in 1781, and in 1789  he decreed that all peasant labor obligations be converted  into cash payments. This measure was violently rejected  not only by the nobility but also by the peasants it  was intended to help since their primitive barter economy  was woefully lacking in money.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Evaluating “Enlightened  Absolutism "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Despite differences, the leading eastern European  monarchs of the later eighteenth  century all claimed that they were acting on  the principles of the Enlightenment. The  philosophes generally agreed with this assessment  and cheered them on. Beginning  in the mid-nineteenth century historians  developed the idea of a common “enlightened  despotism or “enlightened absolutism,  and they canonized Frederick,  Catherine, and Joseph as its most outstanding  examples. More recent research has  raised doubts about this old interpretation  and has led to a fundamental revaluation. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There is general agreement that these absolutists,  especially Catherine and Frederick,  did encourage and spread the cultural  values of the Enlightenment. Perhaps this  was their greatest achievement. Skeptical in  religion and intensely secular in basic orientation,  they unabashedly accepted the here  and now and sought their happiness in the  enjoyment of it. At the same time, they  were proud of their intellectual accomplishments  and good taste, and they supported  knowledge, education, and the arts. No  wonder the philosophes felt that these "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" monarchs were kindred spirits. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Historians also agree that the absolutists believed in  change from above and tried to enact needed reforms.  Yet the results of these efforts brought only very modest  improvements, and the life of the peasantry remained  very hard in the eighteenth century. Thus some historians  have concluded that these monarchs were not really  sincere in their reform efforts. Others disagree, arguing  that powerful nobilities blocked the absolutists’ genuine  commitment to reform. (The old interpretation of  Joseph II as the tragic revolutionary emperor forms part  of this argument.) "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The emerging answer to this controversy is that the  later Eastern absolutists were indeed committed to reform  but that humanitarian objectives were of secondary  importance.

Modern scholarship  has therefore stressed how Catherine, Frederick, and  Joseph were in many ways simply continuing the state- building of their predecessors, reorganizing armies and  expanding bureaucracies to raise more taxes and troops.  The reason for this continuation was simple. The international  political struggle was brutal, and the stakes were  high. First Austria under Maria Theresa and then Prussia  under Frederick the Great had to engage in bitter  fighting to escape dismemberment, while decentralized  Poland was coldly divided and eventually liquidated. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Yet in this drive for more state power, the later absolutists  were also innovators, and the idea of an era of enlightened  absolutism retains a certain validity. Sharing  the Enlightenment faith in critical thinking and believing  that knowledge meant power, these absolutists really  were more enlightened than their predecessors because  they put state-building reforms in a new, broader perspective.  Above all, the later absolutists considered how  more humane laws and practices could help their populations  become more productive and satisfied and thus  able to contribute more substantially to the welfare of the  state. It was from this perspective that they introduced  many of their most progressive reforms, tolerating religious  minorities, simplifying legal codes, and promoting  practical education. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" The primacy of state over individual interests also helps  explain some puzzling variations in social policies. For  example, Catherine the Great took measures that worsened  the peasants’ condition because she looked increasingly  to the nobility as her natural ally and sought to  strengthen it. Frederick the Great basically favored the  status quo, limiting only the counterproductive excesses  of his trusted nobility against its peasants. Joseph II believed  that greater freedom for peasants was the means to  strengthen his realm, and he acted accordingly. Each enlightened  absolutist sought greater state power, but each  believed that a different policy would attain it. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The eastern European absolutists of the later eighteenth  century combined old-fashioned state-building with the  culture and critical thinking of the Enlightenment. In  doing so, they succeeded in expanding the role of the  state in the life of society. They perfected bureaucratic  machines that were to prove surprisingly adaptive and capable  of enduring into the twentieth century. Their failure  to implement policies we would recognize as humane  and enlightened—such as abolishing serfdom—may reveal  inherent limitations in Enlightenment thinking  about equality and social justice, rather than in their execution  of an Enlightenment program.

Although they reached different conclusions when they  turned to social and political realities, they did stimulate  absolute monarchs to apply reason to statecraft and the  search for useful reforms.

{"prompt":"","completion":" 622 CHAPTER 19 • THE EXPANSION OF EUROPE IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" At the end of the seventeenth century the economy of  Europe was agrarian. With the possible exception of Holland,  at least 80 percent of the people of all western  European countries drew their livelihoods from agriculture.  In eastern Europe the percentage was considerably  higher. Men and women lavished their attention on the  land, plowing fields and sowing seed, reaping harvests  and storing grain. Yet even in a rich agricultural region  such as the Po Valley in northern Italy, every bushel of  wheat sown yielded on average only five or six bushels of  grain at harvest during the seventeenth century. By modern  standards output was distressingly low. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In most regions of Europe in the sixteenth and seventeenth  centuries, climatic conditions produced poor or  disastrous harvests every eight or nine years. Unbalanced  and inadequate food in famine years made people extremely  susceptible to illness. Eating material unfit for  human consumption, such as bark or grass, resulted in  intestinal ailments of many kinds. Influenza and smallpox  preyed on populations weakened by famine. In famine  years the number of deaths soared far above normal. A  third of a village’s population might disappear in a year or  two. But new developments in agricultural technology  and methods gradually brought an end to the ravages of  hunger in western Europe. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" • What were the causes and effects of the agricultural  revolution, and what nations led the way in these  developments? "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Open-Field System "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" These new developments drew on long roots. The great  accomplishment of medieval agriculture was the open- field system of village farming. That system divided the  land to be cultivated by the peasants of a given village  into several large fields, which were in turn cut up into  long, narrow strips. The fields were open, and the strips  were not enclosed into small plots by fences or hedges.  Each family followed the same pattern of plowing, sowing,  and harvesting in accordance with tradition and the  village leaders. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The ever-present problem was soil exhaustion. Wheat  planted year after year in a field will deplete the nitrogen  in the soil. Since the supply of manure for fertilizer was  limited, the only way for the land to recover was to lie fallow  for a period of time. In the early Middle Ages a year  of fallow was alternated with a year of cropping; then "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" three-year rotations were introduced, especially on more  fertile lands. This system permitted a year of wheat or rye  to be followed by a year of oats or beans and only then by  a year of fallow. Significant gains in agricultural production  resulted. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Traditional village rights reinforced communal patterns  of farming. In addition to rotating field crops in a  uniform way, villages maintained open meadows for hay  and natural pasture. These lands were common lands, set  aside primarily for draft horses and oxen, but open to the  cows and pigs of the community as well. After the harvest  villagers also pastured their animals on the wheat or rye  stubble. In many places such pasturing followed a brief  period, also established by tradition, for the gleaning of  grain. Poor women would go through the fields picking  up the few single grains that had fallen to the ground in  the course of the harvest. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the age of absolutism and nobility, the state and  landlords continued to levy heavy taxes and high rents,  thereby stripping peasants of much of their meager earnings.  The level of exploitation varied. Generally speaking,  the peasants of eastern Europe were worst off. As we saw  in Chapter 17, they were serfs bound to their lords in  hereditary service. In much of eastern Europe, five or six  days of unpaid work per week on the lord’s land were not  uncommon. Well into the nineteenth century individual  Russian serfs and serf families were regularly sold with  and without land. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Social conditions were better in western Europe, where  peasants were generally free from serfdom. In France,  western Germany, England, and the Low Countries, they  owned land and could pass it on to their children. Yet  life in the village was unquestionably hard, and poverty  was the great reality for most people. The privileges of  Europe’s ruling elites weighed heavily on the people of  the land. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Agricultural Revolution "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" One way for European peasants to improve their difficult  position was to take land from those who owned it  but did no labor. Yet the social and political conditions  that sustained the ruling elites were ancient and deeply  rooted, and powerful forces stood ready to crush protest.  Only with the coming of the French Revolution  were European peasants, mainly in France, able to improve  their position by means of radical mass action. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Technological progress offered another possibility. If  peasants (and their noble landlords) could replace the idle  fallow with crops, they could greatly increase the land  under cultivation. So remarkable were the possibilities "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \f and the results that historians have often spoken of the  progressive elimination of the fallow, which occurred  gradually throughout Europe from the mid-seventeenth  century on, as an agricultural revolution. This revolution,  which took longer than historians used to believe,  was a great milestone in human development. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Because grain crops exhaust the soil and make fallowing  necessary, the secret to eliminating the fallow lies in  alternating grain with nitrogen-storing crops. The most  important of these land-reviving crops are peas and beans,  root crops such as turnips and potatoes, and clovers and  grasses. As the eighteenth century went on, the number  of crops that were systematically rotated grew. New patterns  of organization allowed some farmers to develop increasingly  sophisticated patterns of crop rotation to suit  different kinds of soils. For example, farmers in French  Flanders near Lille in the late eighteenth century used a  ten-year rotation, alternating a number of grain, root, and  hay crops in a given field on a ten-year schedule. Continual  experimentation led to more scientific farming. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Improvements in farming had multiple effects. The  new crops made ideal feed for animals, and because peasants  and larger farmers had more fodder, hay, and root  crops for the winter months, they could build up their  herds of cattle and sheep. More animals meant more  meat and better diets. More animals also meant more  manure for fertilizer and therefore more grain for bread  and porridge. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Advocates of the new crop rotations, who included an  emerging group of experimental scientists, some government  officials, and a few big landowners, believed that  new methods were scarcely possible within the traditional  framework of open fields and common rights. A  farmer who wanted to experiment with new methods  would have to get all the landholders in a village to agree  to the plan. Advocates of improvement argued that innovating  agriculturalists needed to enclose and consolidate  their scattered holdings into compact, fenced-in fields in  order to farm more effectively. In doing so, the innovators  also needed to enclose their individual shares of the  natural pasture, the common. According to proponents  of this movement, known as enclosure, a revolution in  village life and organization was the necessary price of  technical progress. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" That price seemed too high to many poor rural people  who had small, inadequate holdings or very little land at  all. Traditional rights were precious to these poor peasants.  They used commonly held pastureland to graze livestock,  and marshlands or moorlands outside the village as  a source for firewood, berries, and other foraged goods  that could make the difference between survival and "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" The old system of unenclosed open fields and the new  system of continuous rotation coexisted in Europe for a  long time. Open fields could be found in much of France  and Germany in the early years of the nineteenth century  because peasants there had successfully opposed efforts  to introduce the new techniques in the late eighteenth  century.

{"prompt":"","completion":" The Leadership of the Low Countries  and England "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The new methods of the agricultural revolution originated  in the Low Countries. Seventeenth-century republican  Holland, already the most advanced country in  Europe in many areas of human endeavor (see pages 549–  553), led the way. By the middle of the seventeenth century  intensive farming was well established, and the innovations  of enclosed fields, continuous rotation, heavy  manuring, and a wide variety of crops were all present.  Agriculture was highly specialized and commercialized. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" One reason for early Dutch leadership in farming was  that the area was one of the most densely populated in  Europe. In order to feed themselves and provide employment,  the Dutch were forced at an early date to seek maximum  yields from their land and to increase the cultivated  area through the steady draining of marshes and swamps. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The pressure of population was connected with the second  cause: the growth of towns and cities. Stimulated by  commerce and overseas trade, Amsterdam grew from  thirty thousand to two hundred thousand inhabitants in  its golden seventeenth century. The growing urban population  provided Dutch peasants with markets for all they  could produce and allowed each region to specialize in  what it did best. Thus the Dutch could develop their potential,  and the Low Countries became “the Mecca of  foreign agricultural experts who came . . . to see Flemish  agriculture with their own eyes, to write about it and to  propagate its methods in their home lands.1 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The English were the best students. Drainage and water  control were one subject in which they received instruction.

The most famous of these Dutch engineers, Cornelius  Vermuyden, directed one large drainage project in Yorkshire  and another in Cambridgeshire. In the Cambridge  fens, Vermuyden and his Dutch workers eventually reclaimed  forty thousand acres, which were then farmed  intensively in the Dutch manner. Swampy wilderness was  converted into thousands of acres of some of the best  land in England. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Jethro Tull (1674–1741), part crank and part genius,  was an important English innovator. A true son of the  early Enlightenment, Tull adopted a critical attitude  toward accepted ideas about farming and tried to develop  better methods through empirical research. He was especially  enthusiastic about using horses, rather than slower- moving oxen, for plowing. He also advocated sowing  seed with drilling equipment rather than scattering it by  hand. Drilling distributed seed in an even manner and at  the proper depth. There were also improvements in livestock,  inspired in part by the earlier successes of English  country gentlemen in breeding ever-faster horses for the  races and fox hunts that were their passions. Selective  breeding of ordinary livestock was a marked improvement  over the haphazard old pattern. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" By the mid-eighteenth century English agriculture was  in the process of a long but radical transformation. The  eventual result was that by 1870 English farmers were  producing 300 percent more food than they had produced  in 1700, although the number of people working  the land had increased by only 14 percent. This great  surge of agricultural production provided food for England’s  rapidly growing urban population. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Growth in production was achieved in part by land  enclosures. About half the farmland in England was enclosed  through private initiatives prior to 1700; in the  eighteenth century Parliament completed this work.  From the 1760s through the Napoleonic wars of the  early nineteenth century, a series of acts of Parliament enclosed  most of the remaining common land. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" By eliminating common rights and greatly reducing  the access of poor men and women to the land, the  eighteenth-century enclosure movement marked the  completion of two major historical developments in  England—the rise of market-oriented estate agriculture  and the emergence of a landless rural proletariat.

{"prompt":"","completion":" 10  8  6  4  2Population (in millions)  Limitations on Population Growth "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Many commonly held ideas about population in the past  are wrong. One such mistaken idea is the belief that  population was always growing too fast. On the contrary,  until 1700 the total population of Europe grew slowly  much of the time, and it followed an irregular cyclical  pattern (see Figure 19.1). This cyclical pattern had a  great influence on many aspects of social and economic  life. The terrible ravages of the Black Death caused a  sharp drop in population and prices after 1350 and also  created a labor shortage throughout Europe. Some economic  historians calculate that for those common people  in western Europe who managed to steer clear of warfare  and of power struggles within the ruling class, the later  Middle Ages was an era of exceptional well-being. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But this well-being eroded in the course of the sixteenth  century. The second great surge of population  growth (see Figure 19.1) outstripped the growth of agricultural  production after about 1500. There was less  food per person, and food prices rose more rapidly than  wages, a development intensified by the inflow of precious  metals from the Americas and a general, if uneven,  European price revolution. The result was a substantial  decline in living standards throughout Europe. By 1600  the pressure of population on resources was severe in  much of Europe, and widespread poverty was an undeniable  reality. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For this reason, population growth slowed and stopped  in seventeenth-century Europe. Births and deaths, fertility  and mortality, were in a crude but effective balance.  The population grew modestly in normal years at a rate  of perhaps 0.5 to 1 percent, or enough to double the  population in 70 to 140 years. This is, of course, a generalization  encompassing many different patterns. In areas  such as Russia and colonial New England, where there  was a great deal of frontier to be settled, the annual rate  of natural increase, not counting in-migration, might well  have exceeded 1 percent. In a country such as France,  where the land had long been densely settled, the rate of  increase might have been less than 0.5 percent. "}

Although population growth of even 1 percent per  year seems fairly modest, it will produce a very large increase  over a long period: in three hundred years it will  result in sixteen times as many people. Such gigantic increases  simply did not occur in agrarian Europe. In certain  abnormal years and tragic periods—the Black Death  was only the most extreme example—many more people  died than were born. Total population fell sharply, even  catastrophically. A number of years of modest growth  would then be necessary to make up for those who had  died in an abnormal year. Such savage increases in deaths  occurred periodically in the seventeenth century on a  local and regional scale, and these demographic crises  combined to check the growth of population until after  1700.

{"prompt":"","completion":" The grim reapers of demographic crisis were famine,  epidemic disease, and war. Famine, the inevitable result  of low yields and periodic crop failures, was particularly  murderous because it was accompanied by disease. With  a brutal one-two punch, famine stunned and weakened a  population, and disease finished it off. War was another  scourge, and its indirect effects were even more harmful  than the organized killing. Soldiers and camp followers  passed all manner of contagious diseases throughout the  countryside. Armies also requisitioned scarce food supplies  and disrupted the agricultural cycle. The Thirty  Years’ War witnessed all possible combinations of distress.  In the German states, the number of inhabitants  declined by more than two-thirds in some large areas and  by at least one-third almost everywhere else. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" What caused this population growth?

The two main participants in the  putting-out system were the merchant capitalist and  the rural worker. The merchant loaned, or “put out,  raw materials to cottage workers who processed the raw  materials in their own homes and returned the finished  products to the merchant. There were endless variations  on this basic relationship. Sometimes rural workers  bought their own raw materials and worked as independent  producers before they sold to the merchant. Sometimes  whole families were involved in domestic industry;  at other times the tasks were closely associated with one  gender. Sometimes several workers toiled together to  perform a complicated process in a workshop outside the  home. The relative importance of earnings from the land  and from industry varied greatly for handicraft workers,  although industrial wages usually became more important  for a given family with time. "}

The  merchant paid outworkers by the piece and proceeded to  sell the finished product to regional, national, or international  markets. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The putting-out system grew because it had competitive  advantages. Underemployed labor was abundant, and  poor peasants and landless laborers would work for low  wages. Since production in the countryside was unregulated,  workers and merchants could change procedures  and experiment as they saw fit. Because they did not need  to meet rigid guild standards, cottage industry became capable  of producing many kinds of goods. Textiles; all manner  of knives, forks, and housewares; buttons and gloves;  and clocks could be produced quite satisfactorily in the  countryside. Luxury goods for the rich, such as exquisite  tapestries and fine porcelain, demanded special training,  close supervision, and centralized workshops. Yet such  goods were as exceptional as those who used them. The  skills of rural industry were sufficient for everyday articles. "}

It developed most successfully in England,  particularly for the spinning and weaving of woolen  cloth. By 1500 half of England’s textiles were being produced  in the countryside. By 1700 English industry was  generally more rural than urban and heavily reliant on  the putting-out system. Most continental countries, with  the exception of Flanders and the Netherlands, developed  rural industry more slowly. The latter part of the  eighteenth century witnessed a remarkable expansion of  rural industry in certain densely populated regions of  continental Europe (see Map 19.1).  630 CHAPTER 19 • T H E E X P A N S I O N O F E U R O P E I N T H E E I G H T E E N T H C E N T U R Y  Dublin  Edinburgh  Birmingham  Bristol London  Norwich  Amsterdam  Ghent Antwerp  Brussels  Lille  Cologne  Liège  Frankfurt  Rouen Paris  Strasbourg  Nantes  Lyon  Bordeaux Milan  Turin  Genoa  Leghorn  Marseille  Toulouse  Grenoble  Hamburg  Leipzig  Nuremberg  Augsburg Venice  Bologna  Florence  Berlin  Prague  Breslau Vienna  Danzig  Warsaw  Cracow  Buda  Pest  IRELAND  ENGLAND  FRANCE  SWITZ.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Until the nineteenth century, the industry that employed  the most people in Europe was textiles. The making of  linen, woolen, and eventually cotton cloth was the typical  activity of cottage workers engaged in the putting-out  system. A look inside the cottage of the English weaver  illustrates a way of life as well as an economic system. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The rural worker lived in a small cottage with tiny windows  and little space. Indeed, the worker’s cottage was  often a single room that served as workshop, kitchen,  and bedroom. There were only a few pieces of furniture,  of which the weaver’s loom was by far the largest and  most important. That loom had changed somewhat in  the early eighteenth century when John Kay’s invention  of the flying shuttle enabled the weaver to throw the  shuttle back and forth between the threads with one  hand. Aside from that improvement, however, the loom  was as it had been for much of history and as it would remain  until the arrival of mechanized looms in the first  decades of the nineteenth century. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Handloom weaving was a family enterprise. All members  of the family helped in the work, so that “every person  from seven to eighty (who retained their sight and  who could move their hands) could earn their bread,  as one eighteenth-century English observer put it.2 Operating  the loom was considered a man’s job, reserved  for the male head of the family. Women and children  worked at auxiliary tasks; they prepared the warp (vertical)  threads and mounted them on the loom, wound  threads on bobbins for the weft (horizontal) threads, and  sometimes operated the warp frame while the father  passed the shuttle. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There was always a serious imbalance in textile manufacture  before mechanization: the work of four or five  spinners was needed to keep one weaver steadily employed.  Since the weaver’s family usually could not produce  enough thread, alternate sources of labor were  needed. Merchants turned to the wives and daughters  of agricultural workers, who took on spinning work in  their spare time. Many widows and single women also  became “spinsters, so many in fact that the word became  a synonym for an unmarried woman. (In other  parts of Europe, such as the Rhineland, spinning employed  whole families and was not reserved for women.)  As the industry expanded and merchants covered ever  greater distances in search of workers, they sometimes  turned to local shopkeepers to manage the spinners in  their villages. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" There were constant disputes over the weights of materials  and the quality of finished work. Merchants accused  workers of stealing raw materials, and weavers  complained that merchants delivered underweight bales.  Suspicion abounded. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Conditions were particularly hard for female workers.  While men could earn decent wages through long hours of  arduous labor, women’s wages were always terribly low. In  the Yorkshire wool industry, a male wool comber earned a  good wage of twelve shillings or more a week, while a spinner  could hope for only three-and-a-half shillings.4 A single  or widowed spinner faced a desperate struggle with  poverty. Any period of illness or unemployment could  spell disaster for her and any dependent children. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There was another problem, at least from the merchant  capitalist’s point of view. Rural labor was cheap,  scattered, and poorly organized. For these reasons it was  hard to control. Moreover, the pace of work depended  on the agricultural calendar. In spring and late summer  planting and haymaking occupied all hands in the rural  village, leading to shortages in the supply of thread. Merchants,  whose livelihood depended on their ability to  meet orders on time, bitterly resented their lack of control  over rural labor. They accused workers—especially  female spinners—of laziness, intemperance, and immorality.  If workers failed to produce enough thread,  they reasoned, it must be because their wages were too  high and they had little incentive to work. Merchants  thus insisted on maintaining the lowest possible wages to  force the “idle poor into productive labor. They also  successfully lobbied for, and obtained, new police powers  over workers. Imprisonment and public whipping became  common punishments for pilfering small amounts  of yarn or cloth. For poor workers, their right to hold on  to the bits and pieces left over in the production process  was akin to the traditional peasant right of gleaning in  common lands. "}

The number of guilds in  the city of Paris grew from 60 in 1672 to 129 in 1691. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Guild masters occupied the summit of the world of  work. Each guild received a detailed set of privileges from  the Crown, including exclusive rights to produce and sell  certain goods, access to restricted markets in raw materials,  and the rights to train apprentices, hire workers, and  open shops.

Most  men and women worked in non-guild trades, as domestic  servants, as manual laborers, and as vendors of food  and other small goods. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The guilds’ ability to enforce their rigid barriers varied  a great deal across Europe. In England, national regulations  superseded guild regulations, sapping their importance.

More  recent scholarship, however, has emphasized the flexibility  and adaptability of the guild system and its vitality  through the eighteenth century. Guild masters adopted  new technologies and found creative ways to circumvent  impractical rules. For many merchants and artisans, economic  regulation did not hinder commerce but instead  fostered the confidence necessary to stimulate it. In an  economy where buyers’ and sellers’ access to information  was so limited, regulation helped each side trust in the  other’s good faith. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Over the eighteenth century some guilds grew more  accessible to women. This was particularly the case in  dressmaking; given the great increase in textile production,  more hands were needed to fashion clothing for urban  elites. In 1675 Colbert granted seamstresses a new  all-female guild in Paris, and soon seamstresses joined tailors’  guilds in parts of France, England, and the Netherlands.  In the late seventeenth century new vocational  training programs were established for poor girls in many  European cities, mostly in needlework. There is also evidence  that more women were hired as skilled workers by  male guilds, often in defiance of official statutes. Like  their rural counterparts, urban girls and women were entering  the paid labor market in greater numbers. When  French guilds received new statutes in 1777, all were formally  opened to women. The guilds’ final abolition in  1791 makes it impossible to know how this experiment  in sexual equality would have fared. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" The Industrious Revolution "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" One scholar has used the term industrious revolution  to describe the social and economic changes taking place  in Europe in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth  centuries.5 This occurred as households in northwestern  Europe reduced leisure time, stepped up the pace of  work, and, most importantly, redirected the labor of  women and children away from the production of goods  for household consumption and toward wage work. By  working harder and increasing the number of wageworkers,  households could purchase more goods, even in a  time of stagnant or falling real wages. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The effect of these changes is still debated. While some  scholars lament the encroachment of longer work hours  and stricter discipline, others insist that poor families  made decisions based on their own self-interests. With  more finished goods becoming available at lower prices,  households sought cash income to participate in a nascent  consumer economy. The role of women and girls  in this new economy is particularly controversial. When  women entered the labor market, they almost always  worked at menial, tedious jobs for very low wages. The  fantastic rise of the British textile industry in the eighteenth  century was built on the exhausted fingers and  blighted eyesight of untold numbers of female cottage  workers. Yet when women earned their own wages, they  also seem to have taken on a proportionately greater role  in household decision making. Most of their scant earnings  went for household necessities, items they could no  longer produce now that they worked full-time, but  there were sometimes a few shillings left for a few ribbons  or a new pair of stockings. Women’s control over their  surplus income thus helped spur the rapid growth of the  textile industries in which they labored so hard. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" New sources and patterns of labor established important  foundations for the Industrial Revolution of the  late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Britain’s commercial leadership in the eighteenth century  had its origins in the mercantilism of the seventeenth  century (see page 532). European mercantilism was a  system of economic regulations aimed at increasing the  power of the state. As practiced by a leading advocate  such as Colbert under Louis XIV, mercantilism aimed  particularly at creating a favorable balance of foreign  trade in order to increase a country’s stock of gold.

{"prompt":"","completion":" \f war in a violent age. Early English mercantilists shared  these views. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The result of the English desire to increase both military  power and private wealth was the mercantile system  of the Navigation Acts. Oliver Cromwell established the  first of these laws in 1651, and the restored monarchy of  Charles II extended them in 1660 and 1663; these Navigation  Acts were not seriously modified until 1786. The  acts required that most goods imported from Europe  into England and Scotland be carried on British-owned  ships with British crews or on ships of the country producing  the article. Moreover, these laws gave British  merchants and shipowners a virtual monopoly on trade  with British colonies. The colonists were required to ship  their products on British (or American) ships and to buy  almost all European goods from Britain. It was believed  that these economic regulations would help British merchants  and workers as well as colonial plantation owners  and farmers; and the emerging British Empire would develop  a shipping industry with a large number of experienced  seamen who could serve when necessary in the  Royal Navy. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Navigation Acts were a form of economic warfare.  Their initial target was the Dutch, who were far ahead  of the English in shipping and foreign trade in the mid- seventeenth century (see page 553). In conjunction with  three Anglo-Dutch wars between 1652 and 1674, the  Navigation Acts seriously damaged Dutch shipping and  commerce. The British seized the thriving Dutch colony  of New Amsterdam in 1664 and renamed it “New York.  By the late seventeenth century the Netherlands was  falling behind England in shipping, trade, and colonies. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Thereafter France stood clearly as England’s most serious  rival in the competition for overseas empire. Rich in  natural resources, with a population three or four times  that of England, and allied with Spain, continental Europe’s  leading military power was already building a  powerful fleet and a worldwide system of rigidly monopolized  colonial trade. Thus from 1701 to 1763 Britain  and France were locked in a series of wars to decide, in  part, which nation would become the leading maritime  power and claim the profits of Europe’s overseas expansion  (see Map 19.2).

"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Land and Labor in British America "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As Britain built its empire in North America, it secured  an important outlet for surplus population, so that migration  abroad limited poverty at home. The settlers also  benefited, for they enjoyed privileged access to virtually  free and unlimited land. The situation in the American  colonies contrasted sharply with that in the British Isles,  where land was already highly concentrated in the hands  of the nobility and gentry in 1700. White settlers who  came to the colonies as free men and women could obtain  their own farms on easy terms, and those who came  as indentured servants pledged to work seven years for  their passage or as convicts could do so as soon as they  had their personal freedom. Unlike the great majority of  European peasants, American farmers kept most of what  they produced. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Cheap land and the tremendous demand for scarce  labor also fostered the growth of slavery in the British  colonies. The Spanish and the Portuguese had introduced  slavery into the Americas in the sixteenth century.  Because Native Americans died in large numbers when  enslaved, the Spanish and Portuguese began importing  most slaves from Africa. In the seventeenth century the  Dutch aggressively followed their example and transported  some two hundred thousand Africans to the  Americas. There slaves worked on sugar plantations that  normally earned large profits for plantation owners and  European traders. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As England adopted mercantilist policies after 1650,  big investors established valuable sugar plantations in  the Caribbean and brought slave laborers from Africa to  work them. The small white farmers, who had settled the  islands and grew tobacco, generally sold out and migrated  to the mainland colonies. Black slaves then became  the overwhelming majority of the population, as  they were in other European colonies in the Caribbean.  By 1700 the pattern of plantations based on slave exploitation  had spread to the Virginia lowlands, and by "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Slavery was uncommon in New England and the middle  colonies, and in the course of the eighteenth century  these areas began to export foodstuffs to the West Indies  to feed the slaves. The plantation owners, whether they  grew tobacco in Virginia and Maryland or sugar in the  West Indies, had the exclusive privilege of supplying the  British Isles with their products. Thus white colonists,  too, had their place in the protective mercantile system of  the Navigation Acts. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Although the trade in African people was a worldwide  phenomenon, the Atlantic slave trade became its most  significant portion. In the words of a leading historian,  by 1700 “it was impossible to imagine the Atlantic system  without slavery and the slave trade.8 "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" throughout the eighteenth century. Indeed, the brutal  trade intensified dramatically after 1700 and especially after  1750. According to one authoritative estimate, European  traders purchased and shipped 6.13 million African  slaves across the Atlantic between 1701 and 1800—fully  52 percent of the estimated total of 11.7 million Africans  transported between 1450 and 1900, not including an  additional 10 to 15 percent who died in procurement  and transit.9 By the peak decade of the 1780s, shipments  averaged about eighty thousand individuals per year in an  attempt to satisfy the constantly rising demand for labor  power—and slave owners’ profits—in the Americas. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Taken to the Americas in chains, Africans made a decisive  contribution to the development of the Atlantic  economy. Above all, the labor of enslaved Africans made  possible large-scale production of valuable commodities  for sale in Europe, for Africans transported to the Americas  could not go off and farm for themselves as white  settlers did. Indeed, an important recent study concludes "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" that in the years from 1761 to 1800 Africans and their  descendants in Brazil, Spanish America, the Caribbean,  and Britain’s mainland slave colonies accounted for more  than four-fifths of all the commodities produced in the  Americas for sale in the Atlantic economy.10 It was this  flood of ever-cheaper sugar, coffee, tobacco, rice, and (in  the nineteenth century) cotton that generated hard cash  in the Americas—cash that paid for manufactured goods  and services from Britain and Europe as well as for more  slaves from Africa. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Intensification of the slave trade resulted in fundamental  changes in its organization. Before 1700 European  states waged costly wars with one another through monopolist  trading companies in the hope of controlling  slave exports. European agents in fortified trading posts  tapped into traditional African networks for slaves, who  were mainly captives taken in battles between African  states, plus some Africans punished with slavery by local  societies or secured through small-scale raiding. After "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \f 1700, as Britain became the undisputed leader in the  slave trade, European governments and ship captains cut  back on fighting among themselves and concentrated on  commerce. They generally adopted the shore method of  trading, which was less expensive. Thus European ships  sent boats ashore or invited African dealers to bring  traders and slaves out to their ships. This method allowed  ships to move easily along the coast from market to market  and to depart more quickly for the Americas. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Increasing demand resulted in rising prices for African  slaves in the eighteenth century. Some African merchants  and rulers who controlled exports profited, and some  Africans secured foreign products that they found appealing  because of price or quality. But generally such  economic returns did not spread very far, and the negative  consequences of the expanding slave trade predominated.  Wars between Africans to obtain salable captives  increased, and leaders purchased more arms and bought  relatively fewer textiles and consumer goods. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The kingdom of Dahomey, which entered the slave  trade in the eighteenth century and made it a royal monopoly,  built up its army, attacked far into the interior,  and profited greatly as a major supplier of slaves. More  common perhaps was the experience of the kingdom of  the Congo in central Africa, where the perpetual Portuguese  search for slaves undermined the monarchy, destroyed  political unity, and led to constant disorder. All  along Africa’s western coast small-scale slave raiding also  spread far into the interior. There kidnappers seized and  enslaved men and women like Olaudah Equiano and his  sister, whose tragic separation, exile, and exploitation  personified the full horror of the Atlantic slave trade. (See  the feature “Individuals in Society: Olaudah Equiano.)  Africans who committed crimes had traditionally paid  fines, but because of the urgent demand for slaves many  misdemeanors became punishable by sale to slave dealers.  Finally, while the population of Europe (and Asia) grew  substantially in the eighteenth century, that of Africa  stagnated or possibly declined. "}

British  women played a critical role in this mass movement, denouncing  the immorality of human bondage and stressing  the cruel and sadistic treatment of female slaves and  slave families. These attacks put the defenders of slavery  on the defensive. In 1807 Parliament abolished the  British slave trade, although slavery continued in British  colonies and the Americas for years. "}

Yet in one of those striking reversals  with which history is replete, Spain revived. The empire  held together and even prospered, while a European- oriented landowning aristocracy enhanced its position in  colonial society. Spain recovered in part because of better  leadership. Louis XIV’s grandson, who took the throne  as Philip V (r. 1700–1746), brought new men and fresh  ideas with him from France and rallied the Spanish  people to his Bourbon dynasty in the long War of the  Spanish Succession. When peace was restored, a series of  reforming ministers reasserted royal authority, overhauling  state finances and strengthening defense. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Revitalization in Madrid had positive results in the  colonies, which defended themselves from numerous  British attacks and even increased in size. Spain won  Louisiana from France in 1763, and missionaries and  ranchers extended Spanish influence all the way to northern  California. Political success was matched by economic  improvement. After declining markedly in the  seventeenth century, silver mining recovered greatly, and  in 1800 Spanish America accounted for half the world’s  silver production. Silver mining also stimulated food production  for the mining camps and gave the Creoles—  people of Spanish blood born in America—the means to  purchase more and more European luxuries and manufactured  goods.

His father, one of the village elders (or chieftains),  presided over a large household that included  “many slaves, prisoners captured in local wars. All  people, slave and free, shared in the cultivation of  family lands. One day, when all the adults were in the  fields, two strange men and a woman broke into the  family compound, kidnapped the eleven-year-old boy  and his sister, tied them up, and dragged them into the  woods. Brother and sister were separated, and Olaudah  was sold several times to various dealers before reaching  the coast. As it took six months to walk there, his  home must have been far inland. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The slave ship and the strange appearance of the  white crew terrified the boy. Much worse was the long  voyage from Benin to Barbados in the Caribbean, as  Equiano later recounted. “The stench of the [ship’s]  hold . . . became absolutely pestilential . . . [and]  brought on a sickness among the slaves, of which many  died. . . . The shrieks of the women and the groans of  the dying rendered the whole a scene of horror almost  inconceivable. Placed on deck with the sick and dying,  Equiano saw two and then three of his “enchained  countrymen escape somehow through the nettings  and jump into the sea, “preferring death to such a life  of misery.* "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Equiano’s new owner, an officer in the Royal Navy,  took him to England and saw that the lad received  some education. Engaged in bloody action in Europe  for almost four years as a captain’s boy in the Seven  Years’ War, Equiano hoped that his loyal service and  Christian baptism would help secure his freedom. He  also knew that slavery was generally illegal in England.  But his master deceived him. Docking in London, he  and his accomplices forced a protesting and heartbroken  Equiano onto a ship bound for the Caribbean. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There he was sold to Robert King, a Quaker merchant  from Philadelphia who dealt in sugar and rum.  Equiano developed his mathematical skills, worked  hard to please as a clerk in King’s warehouse, and  became first mate on one of King’s ships.

King urged his talented former slave to stay on as "}

Renamed  Batavia, the port became the center of Dutch operations  in the Indian Ocean. Exchanging European manufactured  goods—armor, firearms, linens, and toys—the  Dutch soon captured a monopoly on the lucrative spice  trade. Within a few decades they had expelled the Portuguese  from Ceylon and other East Indian islands. Unlike  the Portuguese, the Dutch transformed the Indian  Ocean trading world, turning formerly autonomous business  partners into dependents (see Map 16.3 on page  552). "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Dutch hold in Asia faltered in the eighteenth  century because of the company’s failure to diversify to  meet changing consumption patterns.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Britain initially struggled for a foothold in Asia. With  the Dutch monopolizing the Indian Ocean, the British  focused on India, where they were minor players  throughout the seventeenth century. The English East  India Company relied on trade concessions from the  powerful Mughal emperor, who granted only piecemeal  access to the subcontinent. Finally, in 1716 the Mughals  conceded empire-wide trading privileges. To further their  economic interests, East India Company agents increasingly  intervened in local affairs and made alliances or  waged war against Indian princes. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Adam Smith and Economic Liberalism "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Although mercantilist policies strengthened European  colonial empires in the eighteenth century, a strong reaction  against mercantilism ultimately set in. Creole merchants  chafed at regulations imposed from Madrid. Small  English merchants complained loudly about the injustice  of handing over exclusive trading rights to great combines  such as the East India Company. Wanting a bigger  position in overseas commerce, independent merchants  in many countries began campaigning against “monopolies  and calling for “free trade. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The general idea of freedom of enterprise in foreign  trade was developed by Adam Smith (1723–1790), a  professor of philosophy and a leading figure of the Scottish  Enlightenment. Smith, whose Inquiry into the Nature  and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (1776) established  the basis for modern economics, was highly critical of  eighteenth-century mercantilism. Mercantilism, he said,  meant a combination of stifling government regulations  and unfair privileges for state-approved monopolies and  government favorites. Far preferable was free competition,  which would best protect consumers from price  gouging and give all citizens a fair and equal right to do  what they did best. In keeping with his deep-seated fear  of political oppression and with the “system of natural  liberty that he advocated, Smith argued that government  should limit itself to “only three duties: it should  provide a defense against foreign invasion, maintain civil  order with courts and police protection, and sponsor certain  indispensable public works and institutions that  could never adequately profit private investors. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Smith saw the pursuit of self-interest in a competitive  market as the source of an underlying and previously unrecognized  harmony that he believed would result in  gradual progress. According to Smith: "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" [Every individual generally] neither intends to promote the  public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it....  He is in this case, as in many cases, led by an invisible hand  to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is  it always the worse for society that it was not part of it. I  have never known much good done by those who affected to  trade for the public good.12 "}

Unlike  many disgruntled merchant capitalists, he applauded the  modest rise in real wages of British workers in the eighteenth  century and went on to say that “No society can  surely be flourishing and happy, of which the far greater  part of the members are poor and miserable. Quite realistically,  Smith concluded that employers were “always  and everywhere in a sort of tacit, but constant and uniform  combination, not to raise the wages of labour above  their actual rate and sometimes entered “into particular  combinations to sink the wages even below this rate.13  He also deplored the deadening effects of the division of "}

New crops and intensified crop rotation  created new food sources for both people and livestock.

It is now clear that the extended,  three-generation family was a rarity in western and central  Europe by 1700. Indeed, the extended family may  never have been common in Europe, although it is hard  to know about the early Middle Ages because very few  records survive. When young European couples married,  they normally established their own households and lived  apart from their parents. If a three-generation household  came into existence, it was usually because a widowed  parent moved into the home of a married child. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Moreover, most people did not marry young in the  seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The average person  who was neither rich nor aristocratic married surprisingly  late, many years after reaching adulthood and many  more after beginning to work. In one well-studied, apparently  typical English village in the seventeenth and  eighteenth centuries, both men and women married for  the first time at an average age of twenty-seven or older.  A similar pattern existed in eighteenth-century France,  where women married around age twenty-five and men  around age twenty-seven. A substantial portion of men  and women never married at all. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The custom of late marriage combined with a nuclear- family household distinguished European society from  other areas of the world.

Late  marriage joined a mature man and a mature woman—  two adults who had already accumulated social and economic  capital and could transmit self-reliance and skills  to the next generation. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Why was marriage delayed? The main reason was that  couples normally did not marry until they could support  themselves economically. Peasants often needed to wait  until the father’s death to inherit land and marry. In the  towns, men and women worked to accumulate enough  savings to start a small business and establish a household.  Most youths began apprenticeships in their mid- teens; given average marriage ages, we may deduce that  it took about ten more years of work to earn enough for  marriage. "}

In most trades he earned little and  worked hard, but if he was lucky, he might eventually be  admitted to a guild and establish his economic independence.  Many poor families could not afford apprenticeship,  leaving their sons without the skills and status of  guild journeymen. These youths drifted from one tough  job to another: hired hand for a small farmer, wage laborer  on a new road, carrier of water in a nearby town.  They were always subject to economic fluctuations, and  unemployment was a constant threat. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Many girls also left their families to work in adolescence.  The range of opportunities open to them was more limited,  however. Apprenticeship was available in some cities,  usually with mistresses in traditionally female occupations  like seamstresses, linen drapers, or midwives. With the  growth in production of finished goods for the emerging  consumer economy during the eighteenth century, demand  rose for skilled female labor. Even male guildsmen  hired girls and women, despite guild restrictions. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Service in another family’s household was by far the  most common job for girls, and even middle-class families  often sent their daughters into service. The legions  of young servant girls worked hard but had little independence.  Sometimes the employer paid the girl’s wages  directly to her parents. Constantly under the eye of her  mistress, the servant girl had many tasks—cleaning, shopping,  cooking, caring for the baby. Often the work was  endless, for there were few laws to limit exploitation.  Court records are full of servant girls’ complaints of physical  mistreatment by their mistresses. There were many  like the fifteen-year-old English girl in the early eighteenth  century who told the judge that her mistress had  not only called her “very opprobrious names, as Bitch,  Whore and the like, but also “beat her without provocation  and beyond measure.1 "}

Boys were far less vulnerable,  though, to the sexual harassment and assault  that threatened female servants.

Indeed, “the  evidence suggests that in all European countries, from  Britain to Russia, the upper classes felt perfectly free to  exploit sexually girls who were at their mercy.2 If the girl  became pregnant, she could be quickly fired and thrown  out in disgrace to make her own way.

Despite this repression,  prostitution flourished in European cities and towns in  the eighteenth century. Most prostitutes were working  women who turned to the sex trade when confronted  with unemployment or seasonal shortages of work. Such  women did not become social pariahs, but retained ties  with the communities of laboring poor to which they  belonged. If caught by the police, however, they were  liable to imprisonment or banishment. Venereal disease  was also a constant threat.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Premarital Sex and Community Controls "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Did the plight of some former servant girls mean that late  marriage in preindustrial Europe went hand in hand with  premarital sex and many illegitimate children? For most  of western and central Europe until at least 1750, the answer  is no. English parish registers seldom listed more  than one illegitimate child out of every twenty children  baptized. Some French parishes in the seventeenth century  had extraordinarily low rates of illegitimacy, with less  than 1 percent of the babies born out of wedlock. Illegitimate  babies were apparently a rarity, at least as far as the  official church records are concerned. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Many unmarried couples satisfied their sexual desires  with fondling and petting. Others went further and engaged  in premarital intercourse. In one well-studied English  village, 33 percent of all first children were conceived  before the couple was married, and many were born  within three months of the marriage ceremony. In the  mid-eighteenth century 20 percent of the women in the  French village of Auffay in Normandy were pregnant  when they got married, although only 2 percent of all  babies in the village were born to unwed mothers. No  doubt many of these French and English couples were already  betrothed, or at least “going steady, before they  entered into intimate relationships, and pregnancy simply  set the marriage date once and for all. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The combination of very low rates of illegitimate birth  with large numbers of pregnant brides reflects the  powerful community controls of the traditional village,  particularly the open-field village, with its pattern of cooperation  and common action. That spirit of common  action was rapidly mobilized by the prospect of an unwed  (and therefore poor) mother with an illegitimate child, a  condition inevitably viewed as a grave threat to the economic,  social, and moral stability of the closely knit community.  Irate parents, anxious village elders, indignant  priests, and stern landlords all combined to pressure  young people who wavered about marriage in the face of  unexpected pregnancies. In the countryside these controls  meant that premarital sex was not entered into  lightly and that it was generally limited to those contemplating  marriage. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The concerns of the village and the family weighed  heavily on most aspects of a couple’s life both before  and after marriage. Whereas uninvolved individuals today  are inclined to stay out of the domestic disputes and  marital scandals of their neighbors, the people in peasant  communities gave such affairs loud and unfavorable publicity  either at the time of the event or during the Carnival  season (see page 675). Relying on degrading public "}

They would parade the overly  brutal spouse-beating husband (or wife), or the couple  whose adultery had been discovered, all around the village,  loudly proclaiming the offender’s misdeeds with  scorn and ridicule. The donkey ride and other colorful  humiliations ranging from rotten vegetables splattered  on the doorstep to obscene and insulting midnight serenades  were common punishments throughout much of  Europe. They epitomized the community’s far-reaching  effort to police personal behavior and maintain community  standards. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Community controls did not extend to family planning,  however. Once a man and a woman married, they  generally had several children. Birth control within marriage  was not unknown in western and central Europe  before the nineteenth century, but it was primitive and  quite undependable. The most common method was  coitus interruptus—withdrawal by the male before ejaculation.  The French, who were apparently early leaders  in contraception, were using this method extensively to  limit family size by the end of the eighteenth century.  Mechanical and other means of contraception were also  used in the eighteenth century, but mainly by certain sectors  of the urban population. The “fast set of London  used the “sheath regularly, although primarily to protect  against venereal disease, not against pregnancy. Prostitutes  used various contraceptive techniques to prevent  pregnancy, and such information was available in large  towns if a person really sought it. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" New Patterns of Marriage  and Illegitimacy "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the second half of the eighteenth century, the pattern  of late marriage and few births out of wedlock began to  break down. The number of illegitimate births soared  between about 1750 and 1850 as much of Europe experienced  an illegitimacy explosion. In Frankfurt, Germany,  for example, illegitimate births rose steadily from  about 2 percent of all births in the early 1700s to a peak  of about 25 percent around 1850. In Bordeaux, France,  36 percent of all babies were being born out of wedlock  by 1840. Small towns and villages experienced less startling  climbs, but between 1750 and 1850 increases from  a range of 1 to 3 percent initially to 10 to 20 percent  were commonplace. Fewer young people were abstaining  from premarital intercourse, and, more important, fewer "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" young men were marrying the women they got pregnant.  Thus a profound sexual and cultural transformation  took place. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Historians are still debating the meaning of this transformation,  but two interrelated ideas dominate most  interpretations. First, the growth of cottage industry created  new opportunities for earning a living, opportunities  not tied to the land. Cottage industry tended to  develop in areas where the land was poor in quality and  divided into small, inadequate holdings. As cottage industry  took hold in such areas, population grew rapidly  because young people attained greater independence and  did not have to wait to inherit a farm in order to get married.  A scrap of ground for a garden and a cottage for  the loom and spinning wheel could be quite enough for  a modest living. A contemporary observer of an area of  rapidly growing cottage industry in Switzerland at the  end of the eighteenth century described these changes: "}

But such scolding  did not stop cottage workers from marrying for love  rather than for economic considerations as they blazed a  path that factory workers would follow in the nineteenth  century. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Second, the needs of a growing population sent many  young villagers to towns and cities in search of employment.  Mobility in turn encouraged new sexual and marital  relationships that were less subject to village tradition  and more likely to produce illegitimate births. Most  young women in urban areas found work only as servants  or textile workers. Poorly paid, insecure, and with little  possibility of truly independent lives, they looked to marriage  and family life as an escape from the vulnerabilities  of the single life. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Promises of marriage from a man of the working girl’s  own class often led to sex, which was viewed as part of  serious courtship. In one medium-size French city in  1787–1788, the great majority of unwed mothers stated "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" that sexual intimacy had followed promises of marriage.  Their sisters in rural Normandy reported again and again  that they had been “seduced in anticipation of marriage. 5 Many soldiers, day laborers, and male servants  were no doubt sincere in their proposals. But their lives  were also insecure, and many hesitated to take on the  burden of a wife and child. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Thus it became increasingly difficult for a woman to  convert pregnancy into marriage, and in a growing number  of cases the intended marriage did not take place.  The romantic, yet practical dreams and aspirations of  many young people were frustrated by low wages, inequality,  and changing economic and social conditions.  Old patterns of marriage and family were breaking down.  Only in the late nineteenth century would more stable  patterns reappear. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the traditional framework of agrarian Europe, women  married late but then began bearing children rapidly. If a  woman married before she was thirty, and if both she and  her husband lived to fifty, she would most likely give  birth to six or more children. The newborn child entered  a dangerous world. Newborns were vulnerable to infectious  diseases of the chest and stomach, and many babies  died of dehydration brought about by bad bouts of ordinary  diarrhea. Of those who survived infancy, many more  died in childhood. Even in rich families little could be  done for an ailing child. Childbirth could also be dangerous.  Women who bore six children faced a cumulative  risk of dying in childbirth of 5 to 10 percent, a thousand  times as great as the risk in Europe today.6 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Schools and formal education played only a modest  role in the lives of ordinary children, and many boys and  many more girls never learned to read. Nevertheless, basic  literacy was growing among the popular classes, whose  reading habits have been intensively studied in recent  years. Attempting to peer into the collective attitudes of  the common people and compare them with those of the  book-hungry cultivated public, historians have produced  some fascinating insights. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" • What was life like for children, and how did attitudes  toward childhood evolve? "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Child Care and Nursing "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the countryside, women of the lower classes generally  breast-fed their infants for two years or more. Breast"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" feeding decreases the likelihood of pregnancy for the average  woman by delaying the resumption of ovulation.  By nursing their babies, women limited their fertility and  spaced their children from two to three years apart. If  a newborn baby died, nursing stopped, and a new life  could be created. Nursing also saved lives: the breast-fed  infant received precious immunity-producing substances  with its mother’s milk and was more likely to survive than  when it was given other food. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Women of the aristocracy and upper middle class seldom  nursed their own children. The upper-class woman  felt that breast-feeding was crude and undignified. Instead,  she hired a live-in wet nurse to suckle her child  (which usually meant sending the nurse’s own infant away  to be nursed). Urban mothers of more modest means  also relied on wet nurses because they were needed for  full-time work. Unable to afford live-in wet nurses, they  often turned to the cheaper services of women in the  countryside. Rural wet-nursing was a widespread business  in the eighteenth century, conducted within the  framework of the putting-out system. The traffic was in  babies rather than in yarn or cloth, and two or three years  often passed before the wet-nurse worker in the countryside  finished her task. The wet nurse generally had little  contact with the family that hired her, and she was expected  to privilege the newcomer at the expense of her  own nursing child. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Wet-nursing was particularly common in northern  France. Whereas the trend was toward more maternal  nursing in other parts of Europe, wet-nursing grew substantially  in Paris and other northern cities over the eighteenth  century. Toward the end of the century roughly  twenty thousand babies were born in Paris each year. Almost  half were placed with rural wet nurses through a  government-supervised distribution network; 20 to 25  percent were placed with Parisian nurses personally selected  by their parents; and another 20 to 25 percent  were abandoned to foundling hospitals, which would  send them to wet nurses in the countryside. The remainder  (perhaps 10 percent) were nursed at home by their  mothers or live-in nurses.7 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Reliance on wet nurses contributed to high levels of  infant mortality. A study of parish registers in northern  France during the late seventeenth and early eighteenth  centuries reveals that 35 percent of babies died before  their first birthdays, and another 20 percent before age  ten.8 In England, where more mothers nursed, only some  30 percent of children did not reach their tenth birthdays.  Frenchwomen also gave birth to more children  since nursing tends to slow down the return of fertility  after childbirth. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \f Children and Education • 659 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Arrival of the Wet Nurses Wet-nursing was big business in eighteenth-century France, particularly  in Paris and the north. Here, rural wet nurses bring their charges back to the city to be reunited with  their families after around two years of care. These children were lucky survivors of a system that produced  high mortality rates. (Réunion des Musées Nationaux\/Art Resource, NY) "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Why did Frenchwomen send their babies to wet-nurse,  given these high mortality rates? Historians have offered  several explanations, including parental indifference to  the babies’ survival. The likeliest explanation appears to  be a combination of cultural, socioeconomic, and biological  factors. Wet-nursing was a centuries-old tradition in  France, so families were merely following well-established  patterns. Moreover, in this period migration to the cities,  high prices, and stagnant wages pushed more women  into the workforce, often into jobs outside the home  where it was impossible to nurse their babies. A third factor  was that few alternatives existed to breast milk. In an  era before germ theory and sterilization, artificial feeding  methods were known to be dangerous to the newborn.  By turning to wet nurses, mothers who could not nurse  sought the safest affordable alternative. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the second half of the eighteenth century critics  mounted a harsh attack against wet-nursing. Upper-class  women responded positively to the new mindset, but  poor urban women continued to rely on wet nurses until  the late-nineteenth-century introduction of sterilized  cows’ milk and artificial nipples. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Foundlings and Infanticide "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The young woman who could not provide for a child had  few choices, especially if she had no prospect of marriage.  Abortions were illegal, dangerous, and apparently rare.  In desperation, some women, particularly in the countryside,  hid unwanted pregnancies, delivered in secret, and  smothered their newborn infants. If discovered, infanticide  was punishable by death. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \f 660 CHAPTER 20 • THE CHANGING LIFE OF THE PEOPLE "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Women in cities had more choices to dispose of babies  they could not keep. Foundling homes first took hold in  Italy, Spain, and France, spreading to northern and central  Europe after 1700. In eighteenth-century England,  for example, the government acted on a petition calling  for a foundling hospital “to prevent the frequent murders  of poor, miserable infants at birth and “to suppress  the inhuman custom of exposing newborn children to  perish in the streets. As new homes were established and  old ones expanded in the eighteenth century, the number  of foundlings being cared for surged. By the end of  the century European foundling hospitals were admitting  annually about one hundred thousand abandoned  children, nearly all of them infants. In the early nineteenth  century the foundling home in St. Petersburg had  twenty-five thousand children in its care and was receiving  five thousand new babies a year. Still, demand always  exceeded the supply of places. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Across Europe, foundling homes emerged as a favorite  charity of the rich and powerful. At their best eighteenth- century foundling homes were a good example of Christian  charity and social concern in an age of great poverty  and inequality. Yet the foundling home was no panacea.  By the 1770s, one-third of all babies born in Paris were  being immediately abandoned to foundling homes by  their mothers. Moreover, fully one-third of all those  foundlings were abandoned by married couples, a powerful  commentary on the standard of living among the  working poor, for whom an additional mouth to feed  often meant tragedy. The tremendous increase in foundlings  resulted not only from a growth in unwanted illegitimate  children, but also from the growing tendency of  desperately poor parents to abandon children to foundling  homes.9 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Great numbers of babies entered foundling homes,  but few left. Even in the best of these homes, 50 percent  of the babies normally died within a year. In the worst,  fully 90 percent did not survive.10 They succumbed to  long journeys over rough roads, intentional and unintentional  neglect by their wet nurses, and customary  childhood illnesses. So great were the losses that some  contemporaries called the foundling hospitals “legalized  infanticide. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Attitudes Toward Children "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What were the typical circumstances of children’s lives?  The topic of parental attitudes toward children in the  early modern period remains controversial. Some scholars  have claimed that parents did not risk forming emotional  attachments to young children because of high mortality "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" rates. With a reasonable expectation that a child might  die, some scholars believe, parents maintained an attitude  of indifference, if not downright negligence. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Primary Source: Births and Deaths in an English  Gentry Family "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Certainly, contemporaries were well aware of the dangers  of childhood and of the high mortality rates. The  great eighteenth-century English historian Edward Gibbon  (1737–1794) wrote, with some exaggeration, that  “the death of a new born child before that of its parents  may seem unnatural but it is a strictly probable event,  since of any given number the greater part are extinguished  before the ninth year, before they possess the  faculties of the mind and the body. Gibbon’s father  named all his boys Edward after himself, hoping that at  least one of them would survive to carry his name. His  prudence was not misplaced. Edward the future historian  and eldest survived. Five brothers and sisters who followed  him all died in infancy. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Emotional prudence could lead to emotional distance.  The French essayist, Michel de Montaigne, who lost five  of his six daughters in infancy, wrote, “I cannot abide  that passion for caressing new-born children, which have  neither mental activities nor recognisable bodily shape  by which to make themselves loveable and I have never  willingly suffered them to be fed in my presence.11 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In contrast to this harsh picture, however, historians  have drawn ample evidence from diaries, letters, and family  portraits that many parents did cherish their children  and suffered greatly when they died. The English poet  Ben Jonson wrote movingly of the death of his six-yearold  son Benjamin, which occurred during a London  plague outbreak in 1603: "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" On My First Son  Farewell, thou child of my right hand, and joy;  My sin was too much hope of thee, loved boy.  Seven years thou wert lent to me, and I thee pay,  Exacted by thy fate, on the just day. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In a society characterized by violence and brutality, discipline  of children was often severe. The novelist Daniel  Defoe (1659–1731), who was always delighted when he  saw young children working hard in cottage industry,  coined the axiom “Spare the rod and spoil the child. He  meant it. So did Susannah Wesley (1669–1742), mother  of John Wesley, the founder of Methodism. According to  her, the first task of a parent toward her children was “to  conquer the will, and bring them to an obedient temper.  She reported that her babies were “taught to fear "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" the rod, and to cry softly; by which means they escaped  the abundance of correction they might otherwise have  had, and that most odious noise of the crying of children  was rarely heard in the house.12 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Enlightenment produced an enthusiastic new discourse  about childhood and child rearing. Starting around  1760, critics called for greater tenderness toward children  and proposed imaginative new teaching methods. In addition  to supporting foundling homes and urging women  to nurse their babies, these new voices ridiculed the practice  of swaddling babies and using rigid whale-boned  corsets to form children’s bodies properly by “straightening  them out. Instead of dressing children in miniature  versions of adult clothing, critics called for simpler and  more comfortable clothing to allow freedom of movement.  These voices belonged to the overall Enlightenment  celebration of nature and the natural laws that  should guide human behavior. For Enlightenment critics,  the best hopes for creating a new society, untrammeled  by the prejudices of the past, lay in a radical  revision of child-rearing techniques. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" One of the century’s most influential works on child  rearing was Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s Emile, which fervently  advocated breast-feeding and natural dress. Rousseau  argued that boys’ education should include plenty  of fresh air and exercise and that they should be taught  practical craft skills in addition to book learning. React-"}

{"prompt":"","completion":" ing to what he perceived as the vanity and frivolity of  upper-class Parisian women, Rousseau insisted girls’ education  focus on their future domestic responsibilities. For  Rousseau, women’s “nature destined them solely for a  life of marriage and child rearing. The ideas of Rousseau  and other reformers were enthusiastically adopted by elite  women, who did not adopt universal nursing but did at  least begin to supervise their wet nurses more carefully. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For all his influence, Rousseau also reveals the occasional  hypocrisy of Enlightenment thinkers. With regard  to the child-rearing techniques he believed would create  a better society, Rousseau had extremely high expectations;  when it came to the five children he fathered with  his common-law wife, however, he abandoned them all  in foundling hospitals despite their mother’s protests.  None are known to have survived. For Rousseau, the  idea of creating a natural man was more important than  was raising real children. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" The religious struggle unleashed by the Protestant  and Catholic Reformations promoted popular literacy  between 1500 and 1800. Both Protestant and Catholic  reformers encouraged reading as a means of instilling  their teachings more effectively. Thus literacy was often  highest in border areas, such as eastern France, that were  open to outside influences and to competition for believers  from different churches. The growth of popular education  quickened in the eighteenth century, but there  was no revolutionary acceleration, and many common  people received no formal education. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prussia led the way in the development of universal education,  inspired by the Protestant idea that every believer  should be able to read the Bible and by the new  idea of a population capable of effectively serving the  state. As early as 1717 Prussia made attendance at elementary  schools compulsory, and more Protestant German  states, such as Saxony and Württemberg, followed  in the eighteenth century. Religious motives were also  extremely important elsewhere. From the middle of the  seventeenth century, Presbyterian Scotland was convinced  that the path to salvation lay in careful study of  the Scriptures, and it established an effective network  of parish schools for rich and poor alike. The Church of  England and the dissenting congregations established  “charity schools to instruct poor children, and in 1682  France began setting up Christian schools to teach the  catechism and prayers as well as reading and writing.  France did less well than the Habsburg state, the only  Catholic land to promote elementary education enthusiastically  in the eighteenth century. Some elementary  education was becoming a reality, and schools were of  growing significance in the life of the child. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The result of these efforts was a remarkable growth in  basic literacy between 1600 and 1800. Whereas in 1600  only one male in six was barely literate in France and Scotland,  and one in four in England, by 1800 almost nine  out of ten Scottish males, two out of three French males  (see Map 20.1), and more than half of English males were  literate. In all three countries, the bulk of the jump occurred  in the eighteenth century. Women were also increasingly  literate, although they lagged behind men. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The growth in literacy promoted a growth in reading,  and historians have carefully examined what the common  people read in an attempt to discern what they were  thinking. While the Bible remained the overwhelming favorite,  especially in Protestant countries, short pamphlets  known as chapbooks were the staple of popular literature.  Printed on the cheapest paper available, many chapbooks  dealt with religious subjects. They featured Bible  stories, prayers, devotions, and the lives of saints and exemplary  Christians. Promising happiness after death, devotional  literature was also intensely practical. It gave the  believer moral teachings and a confidence in God that  helped in daily living. "}

The almanac was universal, was not controversial,  and was highly appreciated even by many in  the comfortable classes. “Anyone who could would read "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" While it is safe to say that the vast majority of ordinary  people—particularly peasants in isolated villages—did  not read the great works of the Enlightenment, that does  not mean they were immune to its ideas. Urban working  people were exposed to new ideas through the rumor  and gossip that spread across city streets, workshops, markets,  cafés, taverns, and public gardens. They also had  access to cheap broadsides, pamphlets, and newspapers  that helped translate Enlightenment critiques into ordinary  language. Servants, who usually came from rural areas  and traveled home periodically, were well placed to  receive ideas from educated employers and disseminate  them to the village. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Certainly some ordinary people did assimilate Enlightenment  ideals. Thomas Paine, author of some of the  most influential texts of the American Revolution, was an  English corsetmaker’s son who left school at age twelve  and carried on his father’s trade before emigrating to the  colonies. His 1776 pamphlet Common Sense attacked the  weight of custom and the evils of government against  the natural society of men. This text, which sold six hundred  thousand copies, is vivid proof of working people’s  ability to receive Enlightenment ideas; Paine’s stirring  mastery of them was unique, but his access to them was  surely not. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Consumption Habits "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" One of the most important developments in European  society in the eighteenth century was the emergence of a  fledgling consumer culture. Much of the expansion took  place in the upper and upper-middle classes, but a boom  in cheap reproductions of luxury items also permitted  people of modest means to purchase more objects. From  food to ribbons and from coal stoves to umbrellas, the  material worlds of city dwellers grew richer and more diverse.  These developments created new expectations for  comfort and hygiene in daily life. Medical practitioners  greatly increased in number, although their techniques  did not differ much from those of previous generations. "}

As in other developments, England  led the way. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" • How did new patterns of consumption and changing  medical care affect people’s lives?  Diets and Nutrition "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" At the beginning of the eighteenth century, ordinary  men and women depended on grain as fully as they had  in the past. Bread was quite literally the staff of life. Peasants  in the Beauvais region of France ate two pounds of  bread a day, washing it down with water, wine, or beer.  Their dark bread was made from roughly ground wheat  and rye—the standard flour of the common people. The  poor also ate grains in soup and gruel. Even peasants normally  needed to buy some grain for food, and, in full  accord with landless laborers and urban workers, they  believed in the moral economy and the idea of the just  price. That is, they believed that prices should be “fair,  protecting both consumers and producers, and that just  prices should be imposed by government decree if necessary.  When prices rose above this level, they often took  action (see page 525). "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The rural poor also ate a fair quantity of vegetables.  Peas and beans were probably the most common; grown  as field crops in much of Europe since the Middle Ages,  they were eaten fresh in late spring and summer. Dried,  they became the basic ingredients in the soups and stews  of the long winter months. In most regions other vegetables  appeared in season on the tables of the poor, primarily  cabbages, carrots, and wild greens. Fruit was  uncommon and limited to the summer months. Milk was  used primarily to make cheese and butter, which peasants  sold in the market to earn cash for taxes and land rents. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The common people of Europe loved meat and eggs  but seldom ate their fill. Indeed, the poor ate less meat  in 1700 than in 1500 because their general standard of  living had declined as the population surged in the sixteenth  century (see page 626) and meat became more  expensive. Moreover, harsh game laws in most European  countries deprived the poor of the right to hunt and eat  game such as rabbits, deer, and partridges. Only nobles  and large landowners could legally kill game. Few laws  were more bitterly resented—or more frequently broken— by ordinary people than those governing hunting. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The diet of small traders and master craftsmen—the  people of the towns and cities—was less monotonous  than that of the peasantry. The markets, stocked by market  gardens on the outskirts, provided a substantial variety  of meats, vegetables, and fruits, although bread and  beans still formed the bulk of such families’ diets. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The diet of the rich was traditionally quite different  from that of the poor. The upper classes were rapacious  carnivores, and a truly elegant dinner consisted of an  abundance of rich meat and fish dishes, laced with piquant  sauces and complemented with sweets, cheeses,  and nuts of all kinds. During such dinners, it was common  to spend five or more hours at table. There was also  an enormous amount of overdrinking. The English squire,  for example, who loved to hunt with his hounds loved to  drink with a similar passion. Sometimes he ended the  evening under the table in a drunken stupor, but very often  he did not. Wine and meat were consumed together  in long hours of sustained excess, permitting the gentleman  and his guests to drink enormous quantities without  getting stupefyingly drunk. Gout was a common affliction  of the rich. No wonder they were often caricatured  as dragging their flabby limbs and bulging bellies to the  table to stuff their swollen cheeks and poison their livers. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There were also regional dietary differences in 1700.  Generally speaking, northern, Atlantic Europe ate better  than southern, Mediterranean Europe. The poor of  England and the Netherlands probably ate best of all.  Contemporaries on both sides of the Channel often contrasted  the English citizen’s consumption of meat with  the French peasant’s greater dependence on bread and  vegetables. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Patterns of food consumption changed markedly as  the century progressed. There was a general growth of  market gardening, and a greater variety of vegetables appeared  in towns and cities. This was particularly the case  in the Low Countries and England, which pioneered  new methods of farming. Introduced into Europe from  the Americas—along with corn, squash, tomatoes, and  many other useful plants—the humble potato provided  an excellent new food source. Containing a good supply  of carbohydrates, calories, and vitamins A and C, the potato  offset the lack of vitamins from green vegetables in  the poor person’s diet, and it provided a much higher  caloric yield than grain for a given piece of land. After initial  resistance, the potato became an important dietary  supplement in much of Europe by the end of the century.  In the course of the eighteenth century the large towns  and cities of maritime Europe also began to receive semitropical  fruits, such as oranges and lemons, from Portugal  and the West Indies, but they remained expensive.

{"prompt":"","completion":" The most remarkable dietary change in the eighteenth  century was in the consumption of sugar and tea. No  other commodities grew so quickly in consumption. Previously  expensive and rare luxury items, they became  dietary staples for people of all social classes. This was  possible because of the steady drop in prices created by  the expansion of colonial production and slave labor.  Other colonial goods also became important items of  daily consumption in this period, including coffee, tobacco,  and chocolate. Part of the motivation for consuming  these products was a desire to emulate the habits  of “respectable people. The accelerating pace of work  in the eighteenth century also seems to have created new  needs for stimulants among working people. (See the  feature “Listening to the Past: A Day in the Life of Paris  on pages 678–679.) Whereas the gentry took tea as a  leisurely and genteel ritual, the lower classes usually  drank tea at work. With the widespread adoption of  these products (which turned out to be mildly to extremely  addictive), working people in Europe became increasingly  dependent on faraway colonial economies.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Along with foodstuffs, all manner of other goods increased  in variety and number in the eighteenth century.  This proliferation led to a growth in consumption and  new attitudes toward consumer goods so wide-ranging  that some historians have referred to an eighteenth- century “consumer revolution. The result of this revolution  was the birth of a new type of society, in which  people had greater access to finished goods and derived  their self-identity as much from their consuming practices  as from their working lives and place in the production  process.

Instead  of setting new styles, duchesses and marquises now  bowed to the dictates of fashion merchants. Fashion also  extended beyond court circles to touch many more items  and social groups. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Clothing was one of the chief indicators of nascent  consumerism. The wiles of entrepreneurs made fashionable  clothing seem more desirable, while legions of  women entering the textile and needle trades made it  ever cheaper. As a result, eighteenth-century western Europe  witnessed a dramatic rise in the consumption of  clothing, particularly in large cities. One historian has  documented an enormous growth in the size and value  of Parisians’ wardrobes from 1700 to 1789, as well as a  new level of diversity in garments and accessories, colors,  and fabrics. Colonial economies played an important  role, supplying new materials, such as cotton and vegetable  dyes, at low cost. Cheaper copies of elite styles  made it possible for working people to aspire to follow  fashion for the first time.14 Elite onlookers were bemused  by the sight of lower-class people in fashionable dress. In "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Mrs. Cradock’s milkman notwithstanding, this was  primarily a female phenomenon. Parisian women significantly  out-consumed men, acquiring larger and more  expensive wardrobes than those of their husbands, brothers,  and fathers. This was true across the social spectrum;  in ribbons, shoes, gloves, and lace, French working  women reaped in the consumer revolution what they had  sown in the industrious revolution (see pages 633–634).  There were also new gender distinctions in dress. Previously,  noblemen vied with noblewomen in the magnificence  and ostentation of their dress; by the end of the  eighteenth century men had renounced brilliant colors  and voluptuous fabrics to don early versions of the plain  dark suit that remains standard male formalwear in the  West. This was one more aspect of the increasingly rigid  opposition drawn between appropriate male and female  behavior. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Changes in outward appearances were reflected in inner  spaces. Historians have used the probate inventories  drawn up by notaries after people’s death to peer into  ordinary people’s homes. In 1700 the cramped home  of a modest family consisted of a few rooms, each of "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \f which had multiple functions. The same room was used  for sleeping, receiving friends, and producing artisanal  goods. In the eighteenth century rents rose sharply, making  it impossible to gain more space, but families began  attributing specific functions to specific rooms. They also  began to erect inner barriers within the home to provide  small niches in which individuals could seek privacy. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" New levels of comfort and convenience accompanied  this trend toward more individualized ways of life. In 1700  a meal might be served in a common dish, with each person  dipping his or her spoon into the pot. By the end of  the eighteenth century even humble households contained  a much greater variety of cutlery and dishes, making  it possible for each person to eat from his or her own plate.  More books and prints, which also proliferated at lower  prices, decorated the walls. Improvements in glass-making  provided more transparent glass, which allowed daylight  to penetrate into gloomy rooms. Cold and smoky hearths  were increasingly replaced by more efficient and cleaner  coal stoves, which also eliminated the backache of cooking  over an open fire. Rooms were warmer, better lit, more  comfortable, and more personalized. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The scope of the new consumer economy should not  be exaggerated. These developments were concentrated  in large cities in northwestern Europe and North America.  Even in these centers the elite benefited the most  from new modes of life. This was not yet the society of  mass consumption that emerged toward the end of the  nineteenth century with the full expansion of the Industrial  Revolution. The eighteenth century did, however,  lay the foundations for one of the most distinctive features  of modern Western life: societies based on the consumption  of goods and services obtained through the  market in which individuals form their identities and self- worth through the goods they consume. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Medical Practitioners "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With these advances in daily life, how did the care of sickness,  pain, and disease evolve? Medical science continued  to struggle in vain against these scourges. Yet the Enlightenment’s  growing focus on discovering the laws of  nature and on human problems did give rise to a great  deal of research and experimentation. The century also  saw a remarkable rise in the number of medical practitioners.  Therefore, when significant breakthroughs in  knowledge came in the middle and late nineteenth century,  they could be rapidly evaluated and diffused. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Care of the sick in the eighteenth century was the  domain of several competing groups: faith healers, "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Food, Medicine, and New Consumption Habits • 667 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" apothecaries (or pharmacists), physicians, surgeons, and  midwives. Both men and women were prominent in the  healing arts, as had been the case since the Middle Ages.  But by 1700 the range of medical activities open to  women was severely restricted because women were generally  denied admission to medical colleges and lacked  the diplomas necessary to practice. In the course of the  eighteenth century, the position of women as midwives  and healers further eroded. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Faith healers remained active. They and their patients  believed that demons and evil spirits caused disease by  lodging in people and that the proper treatment was to  exorcise, or drive out, the offending devil. This demonic  view of disease was strongest in the countryside, where  popular belief placed great faith in the healing power of  religious relics, prayer, and the laying on of hands. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the larger towns and cities, apothecaries sold a vast  number of herbs, drugs, and patent medicines for every  conceivable “temperament and distemper. Their prescriptions  were incredibly complex—a hundred or more  drugs might be included in a single prescription—and  often very expensive. Some of the drugs and herbs undoubtedly  worked. For example, strong laxatives were  given to the rich for their constipated bowels, and regular  purging of the bowels was considered essential for  good health and the treatment of illness. Like all varieties  of medical practitioners, apothecaries advertised their  wares, their high-class customers, and their miraculous  cures in newspapers and commercial circulars. Medicine,  like food and fashionable clothing, thus joined the era’s  new commercial culture. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Physicians, who were invariably men, were apprenticed  in their teens to practicing physicians for several years  of on-the-job training. This training was then rounded  out with hospital work or some university courses. Because  such prolonged training was expensive, physicians  came mainly from prosperous families, and they usually  concentrated on urban patients from similar social backgrounds.  They had little contact with urban workers and  less with peasants. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Physicians in the eighteenth century were increasingly  willing to experiment with new methods, but time- honored practices lay heavily on them. Like apothecaries,  they laid great stress on purging, and bloodletting was  still considered a medical cure-all. It was the way “bad  blood, the cause of illness, was removed and the balance  of humors necessary for good health was restored. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Surgeons, in contrast to physicians, made considerable  medical and social progress in the eighteenth century.  Long considered to be ordinary male artisans comparable  to butchers and barbers, surgeons began studying "}

They learned that a soldier with an  extensive wound, such as a shattered leg or arm, could  perhaps be saved if the surgeon could obtain a flat surface  above the wound that could be cauterized with fire. Thus  if a soldier (or a civilian) had a broken limb and the bone  stuck out, the surgeon amputated so that the remaining  stump could be cauterized and the likelihood of death  reduced. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The eighteenth-century surgeon (and patient) labored  in the face of incredible difficulties. Almost all operations  were performed without painkillers, for the anesthesias of  the day were hard to control and were believed too dangerous  for general use. Many patients died from the  agony and shock of such operations. Surgery was also  performed in utterly unsanitary conditions, for there was  no knowledge of bacteriology and the nature of infection.  The simplest wound treated by a surgeon could fester  and lead to death. "}

Excluded by tradition and  modesty, the male surgeon (and the husband) rarely entered  this world, because most births, then as now, were  normal and spontaneous. Following the invention of  the forceps, which might have helped in exceptionally  difficult births, surgeon-physicians used their monopoly  over this and other instruments to seek lucrative new  business. Attacking midwives as ignorant and dangerous,  they persuaded growing numbers of wealthy women of  the superiority of their services and sought to undermine  faith in midwives. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Recent research suggests that women practitioners  successfully defended much but not all of their practice  in the eighteenth century.

{"prompt":"","completion":" In 1751 a highly esteemed Parisian midwife left the  capital for a market town in central France. Having  accepted an invitation to instruct local women in the  skills of childbirth, Madame Angelique Marguerite Le  Boursier du Coudray soon demonstrated a marvelous  ability to teach students and win their respect. The  thirty-six-year-old midwife found her mission: she  would become the nation’s midwife. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For eight years Madame du Coudray taught young  women from the impoverished villages of Auvergne.  In doing so, she entered into the world of unschooled  midwives who typically were solid matrons with several  children who relied on traditional birthing practices  and folk superstitions. Trained in Paris through  a rigorous three-year apprenticeship and imbued with  an Enlightenment faith in the power of knowledge, du  Coudray had little sympathy for these village midwives.  Many peasant mothers told her about their difficult  deliveries and their many uterine “infirmities, which  they attributed to “the ignorance of the women to  whom they had recourse, or to that of some inexperienced  village [male] surgeons.* Du Coudray agreed.  Botched deliveries by incompetents resulted in horrible  deformities and unnecessary deaths. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Determined to raise standards, Madame du  Coudray saw that her unlettered pupils learned  through the senses, not through books. Thus she  made, possibly for the first time in history, a life-size  obstetrical model—a “machine—out of fabric and  stuffing for use in her classes. “I had ...the students  maneuver in front of me on a machine . . . which represented  the pelvis of a woman, the womb, its opening,  its ligaments, the conduit called the vagina, the bladder,  and rectum intestine. I added an [artificial] child  of natural size, whose joints were flexible enough to  be able to be put in different positions. Now du  Coudray could demonstrate the problems of childbirth,  and each student could practice on the model in the  “lab session. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As her reputation grew, Madame du Coudray  sought to reach a national audience. In 1757 she published  the first of several editions of her Manual on the  Art of Childbirth.

Classes met mornings and afternoons six  days a week, with ample time to practice on the mannequin.  After a recuperative break, Madame du  Coudray and her entourage moved on. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Teaching thousands of fledgling midwives, Madame  du Coudray may well have contributed to the decline  in infant mortality and to the increase in population  occurring in France in the eighteenth century—an increase  she and her royal supporters fervently desired.

It appears that midwives generally  lost no more babies than did male doctors, who  were still summoned to treat non-elite women only when  life-threatening situations required surgery. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Experimentation and the intensified search for solutions  to human problems led to some real advances in  medicine after 1750. The eighteenth century’s greatest  medical triumph was the conquest of smallpox. With the  progressive decline of bubonic plague, smallpox became  the most terrible of the infectious diseases, and it is estimated  that 60 million Europeans died of it in the eighteenth  century. Fully 80 percent of the population was  stricken at some point in life. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The first step in the conquest of this killer in Europe  came in the early eighteenth century. An English  aristocrat whose beauty had been marred by the pox,  Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, learned about the long- established practice of smallpox inoculation in the Muslim  lands of western Asia while her husband was serving  as British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire. She had  her own son successfully inoculated with the pus from "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" a smallpox victim and was instrumental in spreading the  practice in England after her return in 1722. But inoculation  was risky and was widely condemned because  about one person in fifty died from it. In addition, people  who had been inoculated were infectious and often spread  the disease. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Subsequent success in reducing the risks of inoculation  and in finding cheaper methods led to something  approaching mass inoculation in England in the 1760s.  On the continent, the well-to-do were also inoculated,  beginning with royal families and then spreading to the  middle classes. By the later years of the century smallpox  inoculation was playing some part in the decline of  the death rate and the general increase in European  population. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The final breakthrough against smallpox came at the  end of the century. Edward Jenner (1749–1823), a talented  country doctor, noted that there was a longstanding  belief in the English countryside that dairy  maids who had contracted cowpox did not get smallpox.  Cowpox produces sores that resemble those of smallpox  on the cow’s udder and on the hands of the milker, but  the disease is mild and is not contagious. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" For eighteen years Jenner practiced a kind of Baconian  science, carefully collecting data on protection against  smallpox by cowpox. Finally, in 1796 he performed his  first vaccination on a young boy using matter taken from  a milkmaid with cowpox. After performing more successful  vaccinations, Jenner published his findings in 1798.  The new method of treatment spread rapidly, and smallpox  soon declined to the point of disappearance in Europe  and then throughout the world. Jenner eventually  received prizes totaling £30,000 from the British government  for his great discovery, a fitting recompense for  a man who helped lay the foundation for the science of  immunology. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Though the critical spirit of the Enlightenment made  great inroads in the eighteenth century, the majority of  ordinary men and women, especially those in rural areas,  remained committed Christians. Religious faith promised  salvation and eternal life, and it gave comfort and  courage in the face of sorrow and death. Religion also  remained strong because it was usually embedded in local  traditions, everyday social experience, and popular  culture. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Yet the popular religion of village Europe was everywhere  enmeshed in a larger world of church hierarchies  and state power. These powerful outside forces sought to  regulate religious life at the local level. Their efforts created  tensions that helped set the scene for a vigorous  religious revival in Germany and England. Similar tensions  arose in Catholic countries, where powerful elites  criticized and attacked popular religious practices that  their increasingly rationalistic minds deemed foolish and  superstitious. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" • What were the patterns of popular religion and culture,  and how did they interact with the worldview of the  educated public and the Enlightenment? "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Institutional Church "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As in the Middle Ages, the local parish church remained  the basic religious unit all across Europe. Still largely coinciding  with the agricultural village, the parish fulfilled  many needs. The parish church was the focal point of  religious devotion, which went far beyond sermons and  Holy Communion. It organized colorful processions and  pilgrimages to local shrines. Even in Protestant countries,  where such activities were severely restricted, congre"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" gations gossiped and swapped stories after services, and  neighbors came together in church for baptisms, marriages,  funerals, and special events. Thus the parish church  was woven into the very fabric of community life. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Moreover, the local church had important administrative  tasks. Priests and parsons were truly the bookkeepers  of agrarian Europe, and it is because parish registers were  so complete that historians have learned so much about  population and family life. Parishes also normally distributed  charity to the destitute, looked after orphans, and  provided whatever primary education was available for  the common people. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The many tasks of the local church were usually the  responsibility of a resident priest or pastor, a full-time  professional working with assistants and lay volunteers.  All clerics—whether Roman Catholic, Protestant, Greek  Orthodox, or Russian Orthodox—also shared the fate  of middlemen in a complicated institutional system.  Charged most often with ministering to poor peasants,  the priest or parson was the last link in a powerful  church-state hierarchy that was everywhere determined  to control religion down to the grassroots. However, the  regulatory framework of belief, which went back at least  to the fourth century when Christianity became the official  religion of the Roman Empire, had undergone important  changes since 1500. The Protestant Reformation  had burst forth as a culmination of medieval religiosity  and a desire to purify Christian belief. Martin Luther, the  most influential of the early reformers, preached that all  men and women were saved from their sins and God’s  damnation only by personal faith in Jesus Christ. The  individual could reach God directly, without need of  priestly intermediaries. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As the Reformation gathered force, with peasant upheaval  and doctrinal competition, German princes and  monarchs in northern Europe put themselves at the head  of official churches in their territories. Protestant authorities,  with generous assistance from state-certified theologians  like Luther, then proceeded to regulate their  “territorial churches strictly, selecting personnel and  imposing detailed rules. They joined with Catholics to  crush the Anabaptists, who, with their belief in freedom  of conscience and separation of church and state, had become  the real revolutionaries. Thus the Reformation, initially  so radical in its rejection of Rome and its stress on  individual religious experience, eventually resulted in a  bureaucratization of the church and local religious life in  Protestant Europe. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Reformation era also increased the practical power  of Catholic rulers over “their churches, but it was only  in the eighteenth century that some Catholic monarchs "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \f 672 CHAPTER 20 • THE CHANGING LIFE OF THE PEOPLE "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" began to impose striking reforms. These reforms, which  had counterparts in Orthodox Russia, had a very  “Protestant aspect. They increased state control over  the Catholic Church, making it less subject to papal influence.  Spain, a deeply Catholic country with devout  rulers, took firm control of ecclesiastical appointments.  Papal proclamations could not even be read in Spanish  churches without prior approval from the government.  Spain also asserted state control over the Spanish Inquisition,  which pursued heresy as an independent agency  under Rome’s direction and went far toward creating a  “national Catholic Church, as France had done earlier. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A more striking indication of state power and papal  weakness was the fate of the Society of Jesus, or Jesuits.  The well-educated Jesuits were extraordinary teachers,  missionaries, and agents of the papacy. In many Catholic  countries, they exercised tremendous political influence,  since individual members held high government positions  and Jesuit colleges formed the minds of Europe’s  Catholic nobility. Yet by playing politics so effectively,  the Jesuits eventually elicited a broad coalition of enemies.  Bitter controversies led Louis XV to order the Jesuits  out of France in 1763 and to confiscate their  property. France and Spain then pressured Rome to dissolve  the Jesuits completely. In 1773 a reluctant pope  caved in, although the order was revived after the French  Revolution. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Some Catholic rulers also believed that the clergy in  monasteries and convents should make a more practical  contribution to social and religious life. Austria, a leader  in controlling the church (see page 615) and promoting  primary education, showed how far the process could  go. Maria Theresa began by sharply restricting entry into  “unproductive orders. In his Edict on Idle Institutions,  her successor Joseph II abolished contemplative orders,  henceforth permitting only orders that were engaged in  teaching, nursing, or other practical work. The state also  expropriated the dissolved monasteries and used their  wealth for charitable purposes and higher salaries for ordinary  priests. These measures recalled the radical transformation  of the Protestant Reformation. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Protestant Revival "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In their attempt to recapture the vital core of the Christian  religion, Protestant reformers had rigorously suppressed  medieval practices they considered nonessential  or erroneous. For example, they had taken seriously the  commandment “Thou shalt not make any graven image  (Exodus 20:4), and their radical reforms had reordered  church interiors. Relics and crucifixes were removed, and "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" stained-glass windows were smashed and walls and murals  whitewashed. Processions and pilgrimages, saints and  shrines—all such practices were eliminated because they  had no Scriptural basis. Such revolutionary changes often  troubled ordinary churchgoers, but by the late seventeenth  century the vast reforms of the Reformation were  complete and routinized in most Protestant churches. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Indeed, many official Protestant churches had settled  into a smug complacency. In the Reformation heartland,  one concerned German minister wrote that the Lutheran  church “had become paralyzed in forms of dead doctrinal  conformity and badly needed a return to its original  inspiration.16 His voice was one of many that prepared  and then guided a powerful Protestant revival that succeeded  because it answered the intense but increasingly  unsatisfied needs of common people. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Protestant revival began in Germany. It was known  as Pietism, and three aspects helped explain its powerful  appeal. First, Pietism called for a warm, emotional religion  that everyone could experience. Enthusiasm—in  prayer, in worship, in preaching, in life itself—was the key  concept. “Just as a drunkard becomes full of wine, so  must the congregation become filled with spirit, declared  one exuberant writer. Another said simply, “The  heart must burn.17 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Second, Pietism reasserted the earlier radical stress on  the priesthood of all believers, thereby reducing the gulf  between official clergy and Lutheran laity. Bible reading  and study were enthusiastically extended to all classes,  and this provided a powerful spur for popular education  as well as individual religious development (see page  662). Finally, Pietists believed in the practical power of  Christian rebirth in everyday affairs. Reborn Christians  were expected to lead good, moral lives and to come  from all social classes. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Pietism had a major impact on John Wesley (1703–  1791), who served as the catalyst for popular religious  revival in England. Wesley came from a long line of ministers,  and when he went to Oxford University to prepare  for the clergy, he mapped a fanatically earnest “scheme  of religion. Like some students during final exams, he  organized every waking moment. After becoming a  teaching fellow at Oxford, Wesley organized a Holy Club  for similarly minded students, who were soon known  contemptuously as Methodists because they were so  methodical in their devotion. Yet like the young Luther,  Wesley remained intensely troubled about his own salvation  even after his ordination as an Anglican priest in  1728. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Wesley’s anxieties related to grave problems of the  faith in England. The government shamelessly used the "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Church of England to provide favorites with high-paying  jobs. Building of churches practically stopped while the  population grew, and in many parishes there was a shortage  of pews. Services and sermons had settled into an  uninspiring routine. The separation of religion from local  customs and social life was symbolized by church doors  that were customarily locked on weekdays. Moreover,  Enlightenment skepticism was making inroads among  the educated classes, and deism was becoming popular.  Some bishops and church leaders seemed to believe that  doctrines such as the Virgin Birth were little more than  elegant superstitions. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Spiritual counseling from a sympathetic Pietist minister  from Germany prepared Wesley for a mystical, emotional  “conversion in 1738. He described this critical  turning point in his Journal: "}

But processions were also folklore and tradition, an escape  from work, and a form of recreation. A holiday atmosphere  sometimes reigned on longer processions,  with drinking and dancing and couples disappearing into  the woods. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Catholicism did have its own version of the Pietist revivals  that shook Protestant Europe. Jansenism has been  described by one historian as the “illegitimate off-spring  of the Protestant Reformation and the Catholic CounterReformation. 19 It originated with the Flemish theologian  Cornelius Jansen (1585–1638), who called for a  return to the austere early Christianity of Saint Augustine.  In contrast to the worldly Jesuits, Jansen emphasized  the heavy weight of original sin and accepted the "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \f doctrine of predestination. Although outlawed by papal  and royal edicts as Calvinist heresy, Jansenism attracted  Catholic followers eager for religious renewal, particularly  in France. Many members of elite French society, especially  judicial nobles and some parish priests, became  known for their Jansenist piety and spiritual devotion.  Such stern religious values encouraged the judiciary’s increasing  opposition to the monarchy in the second half  of the eighteenth century. Among the poor, a different  strain of Jansenism took hold. Prayer meetings brought  men and women together in ecstatic worship, and some  participants fell into convulsions and spoke in tongues. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Jansenism was an urban phenomenon. In the countryside,  many peasants in Catholic countries held religious  beliefs that were marginal to the Christian faith altogether,  often of obscure or even pagan origin. On the  Feast of Saint Anthony, for example, priests were expected  to bless salt and bread for farm animals to protect  them from disease. One saint’s relics could help cure a  child of fear, and there were healing springs for many ailments.  The ordinary person combined strong Christian  faith with a wealth of time-honored superstitions. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Inspired initially by the fervor of the Catholic Counter- Reformation and then to some extent by the critical  rationalism of the Enlightenment, parish priests and  Catholic hierarchies sought increasingly to “purify popular  religious practice. Thus one parish priest in France  lashed out at his parishioners, claiming that they were  “more superstitious than devout . . . and sometimes appear  as baptized idolators.20 French priests particularly  denounced the “various remnants of paganism found  in popular bonfire ceremonies during Lent, in which  young men, “yelling and screaming like madmen, tried  to jump over the bonfires in order to help the crops grow  and protect themselves from illness. One priest saw rational  Christians regressing into pagan animals—“the triumph  of Hell and the shame of Christianity.21 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In contrast with Protestant reformers, many Catholic  priests and hierarchies preferred a compromise between  theological purity and the people’s piety. Thus the severity  of the attack on popular Catholicism varied widely by  country and region. Where authorities pursued purification  vigorously, as in Austria under Joseph II, pious peasants  saw only an incomprehensible attack on the true  faith and drew back in anger. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Leisure and Recreation "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The combination of religious celebration and popular recreation  seen in festivals and processions was most strikingly  displayed at Carnival, a time of reveling and excess "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Religion and Popular Culture • 675 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" in Catholic and Mediterranean Europe. Carnival preceded  Lent—the forty days of fasting and penitence before  Easter—and for a few exceptional days in February  or March, a wild release of drinking, masquerading, and  dancing reigned. Moreover, a combination of plays, processions,  and rowdy spectacles turned the established  order upside down. Peasants dressed up as nobles and  men as women, and rich masters waited on their servants  at the table. This annual holiday gave people a much- appreciated chance to release their pent-up frustrations  and aggressions before life returned to the usual pattern  of hierarchy and hard work. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Despite the spread of literacy, the culture of the common  people was largely oral rather than written. In the  cold, dark winter months, families gathered around the  fireplace to talk, sing, tell stories, do craftwork, and keep  warm. In some parts of Europe, women would gather together  in groups in someone’s cottage to chat, sew, spin,  and laugh. Sometimes a few young men would be invited  so that the daughters (and mothers) could size up potential  suitors in a supervised atmosphere. A favorite recreation  of men was drinking and talking with buddies in  public places, and it was a sorry village that had no tavern.  In addition to old favorites such as beer and wine, the  common people turned with gusto toward cheap and potent  hard liquor, which fell in price because of improved  techniques for distilling grain in the eighteenth century. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Towns and cities offered a wide range of amusements.  Many of these had to be paid for because the eighteenth  century saw a sharp increase in the commercialization  of leisure-time activities. Urban fairs featured prepared  foods, acrobats, freak shows, open-air performances, optical  illusions, and the like. Such entertainments attracted  a variety of social classes. So did the growing number  of commercial, profit-oriented spectator sports. These  ranged from traveling circuses and horse races to boxing  matches and bullfights. Modern sports heroes, such  as brain-bashing heavyweight champions and haughty  matadors, made their appearance on the historical scene. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Blood sports, such as bullbaiting and cockfighting,  remained popular with the masses. In bullbaiting the  bull, usually staked on a chain in the courtyard of an inn,  was attacked by ferocious dogs for the amusement of the  innkeeper’s clients. Eventually the maimed and tortured  animal was slaughtered by a butcher and sold as meat.  In cockfighting two roosters, carefully trained by their  owners and armed with razor-sharp steel spurs, slashed  and clawed each other in a small ring until the victor  won—and the loser died. An added attraction of cockfighting  was that the screaming spectators could bet on  the lightning-fast combat and its uncertain outcome. "}

"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the current generation, imaginative research has  greatly increased our understanding of ordinary life and  social patterns of the past. In the eighteenth century the  life of the people remained primarily rural and oriented  toward the local community. Tradition, routine, and  well-established codes of behavior framed much of the  everyday experience. Thus just as the three-field agricultural  cycle and its pattern of communal rights had determined  traditional patterns of grain production, so did  community values in the countryside strongly encourage "}

"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Infancy and childhood were highly vulnerable stages of  life. In some parts of Europe fewer than half of all children  reached the age of ten. Infant mortality was high in  areas, like France, in which wet-nursing was commonly  practiced. Treatment of children could be harsh in an  early modern society that was characterized by much  higher levels of violence and brutality than are Western  societies today. The second half of the eighteenth century  witnessed a new concern with methods of child raising  inspired by Enlightenment efforts to reform human  society. Schools for middling and poor children spread  across Europe, leading to a growth in literacy rates. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The urban populace benefited from the surge in agricultural  and industrial production. People found a  greater variety of food products at the market, including  new stimulants produced in the colonies that soon became  staples of elite and popular consumption. Within  homes, standards of comfort and hygiene increased, and  the emerging consumer society offered new possibilities  for self-expression and individuality. Medical techniques  continued to follow traditional patterns, but the number  of practitioners grew, and great strides were made against  smallpox. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the background of these changes, patterns of recreation  and leisure, from churchgoing and religious festivals  to sewing and drinking in groups within an oral  culture, reflected and reinforced community ties and values.  Many long-standing ideas and beliefs, ranging from  obscure religious customs to support for fair prices, remained  strong forces and sustained continuity in popular  life. A wave of religious revival counteracted the secular  tendencies of the Enlightenment, ensuring that religion  continued to have a strong hold over the popular classes.  The next great wave of change would be inaugurated by  revolution in politics. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Louis-Sébastien Mercier (1740–1814) was the  best chronicler of everyday life in eighteenth-century  Paris. His masterpiece was the Tableau de Paris  (1781–1788), a multivolume work composed of 1,049  chapters that covered subjects ranging from convents  to cafés, bankruptcy to booksellers, the latest  fashions to royal laws. As this excerpt demonstrates,  he aimed to convey the infinite diversity of people,  places, and things he saw around him, and in so  doing he left future generations a precious record of  the changing dynamics of Parisian society in the  second half of the eighteenth century. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Mercier’s family belonged to the respectable  artisan classes. This middling position ideally suited  Mercier for observing the extremes of wealth and  poverty around him. Although these volumes contain  many wonderful glimpses of daily life, they should  not be taken for an objective account. Mercier  brought his own moral and political sensibilities,  influenced by Jean-Jacques Rousseau, to the task. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Chapter 39: How the Day Goes "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It is curious to see how, amid what seems  perpetual life and movement, certain hours keep  their own characteristics, whether of bustle or of  leisure. Every round of the clock-hand sets  another scene in motion, each different from the  last, though all about equal in length. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Seven o’clock in the morning sees all the  gardeners, mounted on their nags and with their  baskets empty, heading back out of town again. No  carriages are about, and not a presentable soul,  except a few neat clerks hurrying to their offices. "}

Waiters from the lemonade-shops are  busy with trays of coffee and rolls, breakfast for  those who live in furnished rooms. . . . "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" An hour later the Law comes into action; a  black cloud of legal practitioners and hangers-on  descend upon the Châtelet,* and the other  courts; a procession of wigs and gowns and brief- bags, with plaintiffs and defendants at their heels. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Midday is the stockbrokers’ hour, and the  idlers’; the former hurry off to the Exchange, the  latter to the Palais-Royal.† The Saint-Honoré‡  quarter, where all the financiers live, is at its  busiest now, its streets are crowded with the  customers and clients of the great. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" At two o’clock those who have invitations to  dine set out, dressed in their best, powdered,  adjusted, and walking on tiptoe not to soil their  stockings. All the cabs are engaged, not one is  to be found on the rank; there is a good deal of  competition for these vehicles, and you may see  two would-be passengers jumping into a cab  together from different sides, and furiously  disputing which was first; on which the cabman  whips up and drives them both off to the  Commissary of Police, who takes the burden  of decision off his shoulders. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Three o’clock and the streets are not so full;  everyone is at dinner; there is a momentary calm,  soon to be broken, for at five fifteen the din is as  though the gates of hell were opened, the streets  are impassable with traffic going all ways at once,  towards the playhouses or the public gardens.  Cafés are at their busiest. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Towards seven the din dies down, everywhere  and all at once. You can hear the cab-horses’  hoofs pawing the stones as they wait—in vain. It  is as though the whole town were gagged and  bound, suddenly, by an invisible hand. This is the  most dangerous time of the whole day for thieves  and such, especially towards autumn when the  days begin to draw in; for the watch is not yet  about, and violence takes its opportunity.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Night falls; and, while scene-shifters set to work  at the play-houses, swarms of other workmen,  carpenters, masons and the like, make their way  towards the poorer quarters. They leave white  footprints from the plaster on their shoes, a trail  that any eye can follow. They are off home, and to  bed, at the hour which finds elegant ladies sitting  down to their dressing-tables to prepare for the  business of the night. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" At nine this begins; they all set off for the play.  Houses tremble as the coaches rattle by, but soon  the noise ceases; all the fine ladies are making  their evening visits, short ones, before supper.  Now the prostitutes begin their night parade,  breasts uncovered, heads tossing, colour high on  their cheeks, and eyes as bold as their hands.  These creatures, careless of the light from shop- windows and street lamps, follow and accost you,  trailing through the mud in their silk stockings  and low shoes, with words and gestures well  matched for obscenity.... "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" By eleven, renewed silence. People are at  supper, private people, that is; for the cafés begin  at this hour to turn out their patrons, and to send  the various idlers and workless and poets back to  their garrets for the night. A few prostitutes still  linger, but they have to use more circumspection,  for the watch is about, patrolling the streets, and  this is the hour when they “gather em in; that  is the traditional expression. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A quarter after midnight, a few carriages make  their way home, taking the non–card players back  to bed. These lend the town a sort of transitory  life; the tradesman wakes out of his first sleep at  the sound of them, and turns to his wife, by no  means unwilling. More than one young Parisian  must owe his existence to this sudden passing  rattle of wheels. Thunder sends up the birth-rate  here too, as it does everywhere else. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" At one in the morning six thousand peasants  arrive, bringing the town’s provision of vegetables  and fruits and flowers, and make straight for the  Halles;§ their beasts have come eighteen leagues  perhaps, and are weary. As for the market itself, it  never sleeps. Morpheus never shakes his poppyseed  there. Perpetual noise, perpetual motion, the  curtain never rings down on the enormous stage;  first come the fishmongers, and after these the  egg-dealers, and after these the retail buyers; for  the Halles keep all the other markets of Paris  going; they are the warehouses whence these  draw their supplies.

{"prompt":"","completion":" This impenetrable din  contrasts oddly with the  sleeping streets, for at  that hour none but  thieves and poets are  awake. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Twice a week, at six, those distributors of the staff of life,  the bakers of Gonesse,** bring in an enormous quantity of  loaves to the town, and may take none back through the  barriers. And at this same hour workmen take up their tools,  and trudge off to their day’s labour. Coffee with milk is,  unbelievably, the favoured drink among these stalwarts  nowadays. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" At street-corners, where the pale light from a street lamp  falls, the coffee women stand, carrying their tin urns on their  backs; they sell their coffee in earthenware cups, two sous a  cup, one penny, and not too well sugared at that; but our  workmen find it very much to their taste.... "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" So coffee-drinking has become a habit, and one so deep- rooted that the working classes will start the day on nothing  else. It is not costly, and has more flavour to it, and more  nourishment too, than anything else they can afford to drink;  so they consume immense quantities, and say that if a man  can only have coffee for breakfast it will keep him going till  nightfall. They take only two meals in the twenty-four hours;  that at midday and the evening snack of supper, what they call  the persillade. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Since July 1789 the origins of the French Revolution have been one  of the most debated topics in history. Historians long explained the  Revolution as a clash between the rising bourgeoisie and the entrenched  nobility in which the former asserted its right to political power commensurate  with its new economic strength. It is now apparent that such  a simplistic explanation cannot account for the complexity of an event  that spanned several decades and involved millions of people and numerous  nations. In uncovering the path to revolution, numerous interrelated  factors must be taken into account. These include deep social changes in  France, a long-term political crisis that eroded monarchical legitimacy,  the impact of new political ideas derived from the Enlightenment, the  emergence of a “public sphere in which such opinions were formed and  shared, and, perhaps most importantly, a financial crisis created by France’s  participation in expensive overseas wars.

{"prompt":"","completion":" While these developments built a thirst for fundamental  political reform, there was nothing inevitable in the  unfolding of the Revolution. As in many historical  events, chance played a significant role in leading the  French to revolution and in the course of events after its  outbreak. Examining the background of institutions,  events, and ideas helps explain how the fascinating and  complex phenomenon known as the French Revolution  came into being. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" • What social, political, and economic factors formed the  background to the French Revolution?  Legal Orders and Social Change "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As in the Middle Ages, France’s 25 million inhabitants  were still legally divided into three orders, or estates—  the clergy, the nobility, and everyone else. As the nation’s  first estate, the clergy numbered about one hundred  thousand and had important privileges. It owned about  10 percent of the land and paid only a “voluntary gift,  rather than regular taxes, to the government every five  years. Moreover, the church levied a tax (the tithe) on  landowners, which averaged somewhat less than 10  percent. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Everyone else was a commoner, legally a member of  the third estate. A few commoners—prosperous merchants,  lawyers, and officials—were well educated and  rich, and they might even have purchased manorial rights  as a way of obtaining profit and social honor. The vast  majority of the third estate consisted of peasants and  agricultural workers in the countryside and urban artisans  and unskilled day laborers. Thus the third estate was  a conglomeration of very different social groups united  only by their shared legal status as distinct from the nobility  and clergy. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The second estate consisted of some four hundred  thousand nobles, the descendants of “those who fought  in the Middle Ages. Nobles owned about 25 percent of  the land in France outright, and they too were lightly  taxed. Moreover, nobles continued to enjoy certain  manorial rights, or privileges of lordship, that dated  back to medieval times. These included exclusive rights  to hunt and fish, village monopolies on baking bread and  pressing grapes for wine, fees for justice, and a host of  other “useful privileges. In addition, nobles had “honorific  privileges such as the right to precedence on public  occasions and the right to wear swords.

{"prompt":"","completion":" In discussing the origins of the French Revolution, historians  long focused on growing tensions between the  nobility and the comfortable members of the third estate,  the bourgeoisie or upper middle class. Increasing in size,  wealth, culture, and self-confidence, this rising bourgeoisie  became progressively exasperated by archaic “feudal  laws restraining the economy and by the pretensions  of a reactionary nobility that was closing ranks against  middle-class aspirations. As a result, the French bourgeoisie  eventually rose up to lead the entire third estate in  a great social revolution that destroyed feudal privileges "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" In recent years, a flood of new research has challenged  these accepted views. Above all, revisionist historians  have questioned the existence of growing social conflict  between a progressive capitalistic bourgeoisie and a reactionary  feudal nobility in eighteenth-century France. Instead,  they see both bourgeoisie and nobility as highly  fragmented, riddled with internal rivalries. The ancient  sword nobility, for example, was profoundly separated  from the newer robe nobility by differences in wealth,  education, and worldview. Differences within the bourgeoisie— between wealthy financiers and local lawyers,  for example—were no less profound. Rather than standing  as unified blocs against each other, nobility and bourgeoisie  formed two parallel social ladders increasingly  linked together at the top by wealth, marriage, and Enlightenment  culture. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Revisionist historians stress three developments in particular.  First, the nobility remained a fluid and relatively  open order. Throughout the eighteenth century substantial  numbers of successful commoners continued to seek  and obtain noble status through government service and  purchase of expensive positions conferring nobility. Second,  key sections of the nobility were no less liberal than  the middle class, and until revolution actually began,  both groups generally supported the judicial opposition  to the government led by the Parlement of Paris. Third,  the nobility and the bourgeoisie were not really at odds  in the economic sphere. Investment in land and government  service were the preferred activities of both groups,  and the ideal of the merchant capitalist was to gain  enough wealth to retire from trade, purchase an estate,  and live nobly as a large landowner. At the same time,  wealthy nobles often acted as aggressive capitalists, investing  especially in mining, metallurgy, and foreign  trade. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Revisionists have clearly shaken the belief that the  bourgeoisie and the nobility were inevitably locked in  growing conflict before the Revolution. But in stressing  the similarities between the two groups, especially at the  top, revisionists have also reinforced the view that the  Old Regime had ceased to correspond with social reality  by the 1780s. Legally, society was still based on rigid orders  inherited from the Middle Ages. In reality, France  had already moved far toward being a society based on  wealth and education in which an emerging elite that included  both aristocratic and bourgeois notables was frustrated  by a bureaucratic monarchy that continued to  claim the right to absolute power.

{"prompt":"","completion":" were registered and given the force of law. The restoration  of this right, which had been suspended under Louis  XIV, was a fateful step. The magistrates of the parlements  were leaders of the robe nobility. In 1604 Henry IV had  created the paulette (see page 528) on royal offices as a  way to raise desperately needed revenue. The unintended  consequence of this act was to transform royal offices, including  judicial positions, into a form of private property  passed down from father to son. By allowing a well- entrenched and highly articulate branch of the nobility to  evaluate the king’s decrees before they became law, the  duke of Orléans sanctioned a counterweight to absolute  power. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" These implications became clear when the heavy expenses  of the War of the Austrian Succession plunged  France into financial crisis. In 1748 Louis XV appointed  a finance minister who decreed a 5 percent income tax on  every individual regardless of social status. Exemption  from most taxation had long been a hallowed privilege of  the nobility, and other important groups—the clergy, the  large towns, and some wealthy bourgeoisie—had also  gained special tax advantages over time. The result was a  vigorous protest from many sides led by the influential  Parlement of Paris. The monarchy retreated; the new tax  was dropped. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Following the disastrously expensive Seven Years’ War  (see pages 635–637), the conflict re-emerged. The government  tried to maintain emergency taxes after the war  ended; the Parlement of Paris protested and even challenged  the basis of royal authority, claiming that the  king’s power had to be limited to protect liberty. Once  again the government caved in and withdrew the taxes.  The judicial opposition then asserted that the king could  not levy taxes without the consent of the Parlement of  Paris, which was acting as the representative of the entire  nation. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" After years of attempting to compromise with the parlements,  Louis XV roused himself for a determined defense  of his absolutist inheritance. “The magistrates, he  angrily told the Parlement of Paris in a famous face-toface  confrontation, “are my officers. . . . In my person  only does the sovereign power rest.1 In 1768 Louis appointed  a tough career official named René de Maupeou  as chancellor and ordered him to crush the judicial opposition. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Maupeou abolished the existing parlements and exiled  the vociferous members of the Parlement of Paris to the  provinces.

{"prompt":"","completion":" philosophes applauded these measures: the sovereign was  using his power to introduce badly needed reforms that  had been blocked by a self-serving aristocratic elite. Most  philosophes, and public opinion as a whole, sided with  the old parlements, however, and there was widespread  criticism of “royal despotism. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Learned dissent was accompanied by scandalous libels.  Known as Louis le bien-aimé (beloved Louis) in his  youth, the king found his people turning against him for  moral as well as political reasons. Kings had always maintained  mistresses who were invariably chosen from the  court nobility. Louis XV broke that pattern with Madame  de Pompadour, daughter of a disgraced bourgeois financier.  As favorite from 1745 to 1750, Pompadour exercised  tremendous influence over literature, art, and the  decorative arts, using her patronage to support Voltaire  and promote the rococo style. Even after their love affair  ended, Pompadour wielded considerable influence over  the king, helping bring about the alliance with Austria  that resulted in the Seven Years’ War. Pompadour’s low  birth and hidden political influence generated a stream of  resentful pamphleteering. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" After Pompadour, the king appeared to sink ever lower  in licentiousness; his last favorite, Madame du Barry, was  derided as a common streetwalker, and the king was  accused of maintaining a brothel of teenage girls at Versailles  to serve his lusts. The illegal stream of scandal- mongering became a torrent. Lurid and pornographic  depictions of the court ate away at the foundations of  royal authority, especially among the common people in  turbulent Paris. The king was being stripped of the sacred  aura of God’s anointed on earth and was being reinvented  in the popular imagination as a degenerate. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Despite this progressive desacralization of the monarchy,  its power was still great enough to ride over the opposition,  and Louis XV would probably have prevailed if  he had lived to a ripe old age, but he died in 1774. The  new king, Louis XVI (r. 1774–1792), was a shy twentyyear- old with good intentions. Taking the throne, he is  reported to have said, “What I should like most is to be  loved.2 The eager-to-please monarch yielded in the face  of vehement opposition from France’s educated elite.  He dismissed chancellor Maupeou and repudiated the  strong-willed minister’s work. Louis also waffled on the  economy, dismissing controller-general Turgot when his  attempts to liberalize the economy drew fire. A weakened  but unreformed monarchy now faced a judicial opposition  that claimed to speak for the entire French nation.  Increasingly locked in stalemate, the country was drifting  toward renewed financial crisis and political upheaval. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \f 687 687  The Impact of the American Revolution "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Coinciding with the first years of Louis XVI’s reign, the  American Revolution had an enormous impact on France  both in practical and ideological terms. French expenses  to support the colonists bankrupted the Crown, while  the ideals of liberty and equality provided heady inspiration  for political reform. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Like the French Revolution, the American Revolution  had its immediate origins in struggles over increased  taxes. The high cost of the Seven Years’ War—fought  with little financial contribution from the colonies—  doubled the British national debt. When the government  tried to recoup some of the losses in increased taxes on  the colonies in 1765, the colonists reacted with anger. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The key questions were political rather than economic.  To what extent could the home government assert its  power while limiting the authority of colonial legislatures  and their elected representatives? Accordingly, who  should represent the colonies, and who had the right to  make laws for Americans? The British government  replied that Americans were represented in Parliament,  albeit indirectly (like most British people themselves),  and that the absolute supremacy of Parliament throughout  the empire could not be questioned. Many Americans  felt otherwise. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In 1773 the dispute over taxes and representation  flared up again after the British government awarded a  monopoly on Chinese tea to the East India Company,  suddenly excluding colonial merchants from a lucrative  business. In response, Boston men disguised as Indians  held a rowdy “tea party and threw the company’s tea  into the harbor. This led to extreme measures. The so- called Coercive Acts closed the port of Boston, curtailed  local elections, and greatly expanded the royal governor’s  power. County conventions in Massachusetts protested  vehemently and urged that the acts be “rejected as the attempts  of a wicked administration to enslave America.  Other colonial assemblies joined in the denunciations. In  September 1774 the First Continental Congress met in  Philadelphia, where the more radical members argued  successfully against concessions to the Crown. Compromise  was also rejected by the British Parliament, and in  April 1775 fighting began at Lexington and Concord. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The fighting spread, and the colonists moved slowly  but inevitably toward open rebellion and a declaration of  independence.

By 1777 French volunteers  were arriving in Virginia, and a dashing young nobleman,  the marquis de Lafayette (1757–1834), quickly  became one of George Washington’s most trusted generals.  In 1778 the French government offered a formal alliance  to the American ambassador in Paris, Benjamin  Franklin, and in 1779 and 1780 the Spanish and Dutch  declared war on Britain. Catherine the Great of Russia  helped organize the League of Armed Neutrality in order  to protect neutral shipping rights, which Britain refused  to recognize. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Thus by 1780 Great Britain was engaged in an imperial  war against most of Europe as well as against the thirteen  colonies. In these circumstances, and in the face of  severe reverses, a new British government decided to cut  its losses and offered peace on extremely generous terms.  By the Treaty of Paris of 1783, Britain recognized the independence  of the thirteen colonies and ceded all its  territory between the Allegheny Mountains and the Mississippi  River to the Americans. Out of the bitter rivalries  of the Old World, the Americans snatched dominion  over a vast territory. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Europeans who dreamed of a new era were fascinated  by the political lessons of the American Revolution. The  Americans had begun with a revolutionary defense  against tyrannical oppression, and they had been victorious.  They had then shown how rational beings could  assemble together to exercise sovereignty and write a  permanent constitution—a new social contract. All this  gave greater reality to the concepts of individual liberty  and representative government and reinforced one of the  primary ideas of the Enlightenment: that a better world  was possible. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" No country felt the consequences of the American  Revolution more directly than France. Hundreds of  French officers served in America and were inspired by  the experience, the marquis de Lafayette chief among  them. French intellectuals and publicists engaged in passionate  analysis of the new federal Constitution as well as  the constitutions of the various states of the new United  States. Perhaps more importantly, the expenses of supporting  the revolutionary forces provided the last nail in  the coffin for the French treasury. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Financial Crisis "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The French Revolution thus had its immediate origins in  the financial difficulties of the government. The efforts of  Louis XV’s ministers to raise taxes had been thwarted by  the high courts, led by the Parlement of Paris, which was "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" strengthened in its opposition by widespread popular  support. When renewed efforts to reform the tax system  met a similar fate in 1776, the government was forced to  finance all of its enormous expenditures during the  American war with borrowed money. As a result, the national  debt and the annual budget deficit soared. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" By the 1780s, fully 50 percent of France’s annual  budget went for interest payments on the debt. Another  25 percent went to maintain the military, while 6 percent  was absorbed by the king and his court at Versailles. Less  than 20 percent of the entire national budget was available  for the productive functions of the state, such as  transportation and general administration. This was an  impossible financial situation. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" One way out would have been for the government to  declare partial bankruptcy, forcing its creditors to accept  greatly reduced payments on the debt. The Spanish  monarchy had regularly repudiated large portions of its  debt in earlier times, and France had done likewise after  an attempt to establish a national bank ended in financial  disaster in 1720. Yet by the 1780s the French debt  was being held by an army of aristocratic and bourgeois  creditors, and the French monarchy, though absolute in  theory, had become too weak for such a drastic and unpopular  action. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Nor could the king and his ministers print money and  create inflation to cover their deficits. Unlike England  and Holland, which had far larger national debts relative  to their populations, France had no central bank, no paper  currency, and no means of creating credit. French  money was good gold coin. Therefore, when a depressed  economy and public distrust made it increasingly difficult  for the government to obtain new gold loans in 1786, it  had no alternative but to try to increase taxes. Since  France’s tax system was unfair and out-of-date, increased  revenues were possible only through fundamental reform.  Such reforms, which would affect all groups in  France’s complex and fragmented society, opened a Pandora’s  box of social and political demands. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Revolution was looming by 1787, though no one  could have realized what was to follow. Spurred by a depressed  economy and falling tax receipts, Louis XVI’s  minister of finance revived old proposals to impose a general  tax on all landed property as well as to form provincial  assemblies to help administer the tax, and he  convinced the king to call an Assembly of Notables to  gain support for the idea. The notables, who were mainly  important noblemen and high-ranking clergy, opposed  the new tax. In exchange for their support, they demanded  that control over all government spending be  given to the provincial assemblies. When the government "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Facing imminent bankruptcy, the king tried to reassert  his authority. He dismissed the notables and established  new taxes by decree. In stirring language, the judges of  the Parlement of Paris promptly declared the royal initiative  null and void. When the king tried to exile the  judges, a tremendous wave of protest swept the country.  Frightened investors also refused to advance more loans  to the state. Finally, in July 1788, Louis XVI bowed to  public opinion and called for a spring session of the Estates  General. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Once Louis had agreed to hold the Estates General, following  precedent, he set elections for the three orders.  As at previous meetings of the Estates General, local assemblies  were to prepare a list of grievances for their representatives  to bring to the next electoral level. This  request, as traditional as it was, set off a flood of debate,  criticism, and demands throughout France. All across the  country, clergy, nobles, and commoners came together in  their respective orders to draft petitions for change and  to elect delegates to the Estates General. These documents  reveal the main complaints French subjects had on "}

A conservative  majority was drawn from the poorer and more numerous  provincial nobility, but fully one-third of the  nobility’s representatives were liberals committed to major  changes. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As for the third estate, there was great popular participation  in the elections. Almost all male commoners  twenty-five years of age and older had the right to vote.  However, most of the representatives selected by the  third estate were well-educated, prosperous members of  the middle class. Most were not businessmen but rather  lawyers and government officials. Social status and prestige  were matters of particular concern to this economic  elite. No delegates from the great mass of laboring  poor—the peasants and urban artisans—were elected. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The petitions for change coming from the three estates  showed a surprising degree of consensus. There was general  agreement that royal absolutism should give way to a  constitutional monarchy in which laws and taxes would  require the consent of the Estates General in regular  meetings. All agreed that individual liberties would have  to be guaranteed by law and that economic regulations  should be loosened. The striking similarities in the grievance  petitions of the clergy, nobility, and third estate reflected  a shared commitment to a basic reform platform  among the educated elite. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Primary Source: The Third Estate Speaks: The Cahier  de Doleances of the Carcassonne "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Yet an increasingly bitter quarrel undermined this consensus  during the intense electoral campaign: how would  the Estates General vote, and precisely who would lead in  the political reorganization that was generally desired?  The Estates General of 1614 had sat as three separate  houses. Each house held one vote, despite the enormous  numerical discrepancies between the estates in the general  population. Given the close ties between them, the  nobility and clergy would control all decisions. As soon  as the estates were called, the aristocratic Parlement of  Paris, mainly out of respect for tradition but partly out of  a desire to enhance the nobility’s political position, ruled  that the Estates General should once again sit separately.  The ruling was quickly denounced by some intellectuals,  who demanded instead a single assembly dominated by  the third estate to ensure fundamental reforms. In his famous  1789 pamphlet What Is the Third Estate? the abbé  Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès argued that the nobility was a  tiny, overprivileged minority and that the neglected third "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" estate constituted the true strength of the French nation.  When the government agreed that the third estate  should have as many delegates as the clergy and the nobility  combined but then rendered this act meaningless  by upholding voting by separate order, reform-minded  critics saw fresh evidence of an aristocratic conspiracy. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In May 1789 the twelve hundred delegates of the  three estates paraded in medieval pageantry through the  streets of Versailles to an opening session resplendent  with feudal magnificence. The estates were almost immediately  deadlocked. Delegates of the third estate refused  to transact any business until the king ordered the clergy  and nobility to sit with them in a single body. Finally, after  a six-week war of nerves, a few parish priests began  to go over to the third estate, which on June 17 voted  to call itself the National Assembly. On June 20 the delegates  of the third estate, excluded from their hall because  of “repairs, moved to a large indoor tennis court.  There they swore the famous Oath of the Tennis Court,  pledging not to disband until they had written a new  constitution. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The king’s response was ambivalent. On June 23 he  made a conciliatory speech urging reforms to a joint session,  and four days later he ordered the three estates to  meet together. At the same time, the vacillating and indecisive  monarch apparently followed the advice of relatives  and court nobles who urged him to dissolve the Estates  General by force. The king called an army of eighteen  thousand troops toward Versailles, and on July 11 he dismissed  his finance minister and his other more liberal  ministers. As Louis XVI belatedly reasserted his “divine  right to rule, middle-class delegates and their allies from  the liberal nobility resigned themselves to being disbanded  at bayonet point. One third-estate delegate reassured  a worried colleague, “You won’t hang—you’ll only  have to go back home.3 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Revolt of the Poor and  the Oppressed "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" While delegates of the third estate pressed for political  rights, economic hardship gripped the common people.  Grain was the basis of the diet of ordinary people in the  eighteenth century, and in 1788 the harvest had been extremely  poor. The price of bread began to soar. In Paris,  where bread was regularly subsidized by the government in  an attempt to prevent popular unrest, the price rose to 4  sous. The poor could scarcely afford to pay 2 sous per  pound, for even at that price a laborer with a wife and three  children had to spend half his wages on the family’s bread. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Harvest failure and high bread prices unleashed a classic  economic depression of the preindustrial age. With  food so expensive and with so much uncertainty, the demand  for manufactured goods collapsed. Thousands of  artisans and small traders were thrown out of work. By  the end of 1789 almost half of the French people would  be in need of relief. One person in eight was a pauper living  in extreme want. In Paris perhaps 150,000 of the  city’s 600,000 people were without work in July 1789. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Against this background of poverty and ongoing political  crisis, the people of Paris entered decisively onto the  revolutionary stage. They believed in a general, though  ill-defined, way that the economic distress had human  causes. They believed that they should have steady work  and enough bread at fair prices to survive. Specifically,  they feared that the dismissal of the king’s moderate finance  minister would put them at the mercy of aristocratic  landowners and grain speculators. Rumors that the  king’s troops would sack the city began to fill the air. Angry  crowds formed, and passionate voices urged action.  On July 13 the people began to seize arms for the defense  of the city as the king’s armies moved toward Paris,  and on July 14 several hundred people marched to the  Bastille to search for weapons and gunpowder. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A medieval fortress with walls ten feet thick and eight  great towers each one hundred feet high, the Bastille had  long been used as a royal prison. It was guarded by eighty  retired soldiers and thirty Swiss mercenaries.

Cannon were  brought to batter the main gate, and fighting continued  until the prison surrendered. The governor of the prison  was later hacked to death, and his head was stuck on a  pike and paraded through the streets. The next day a  committee of citizens appointed the marquis de Lafayette  commander of the city’s armed forces. Paris was lost to  the king, who was forced to recall the finance minister  and disperse his troops.

Thus the French peasantry, which already  owned about 30 percent of all the land, achieved  an unprecedented victory in the early days of revolutionary  upheaval.

Immediately after the fall of the Bastille, many  of France’s great court nobles began to leave Versailles  for foreign lands, so that a plummeting demand for luxuries  intensified the general economic crisis. International  markets also declined. The church was no longer  able to give its traditional grants of food and money to  the poor. Increasing unemployment and hunger put  tremendous pressure on household managers, and the  result was another popular explosion. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" On October 5 some seven thousand desperate women  marched the twelve miles from Paris to Versailles to demand  action. A middle-class deputy looking out from the  Assembly saw “multitudes arriving from Paris including  fishwives and bullies from the market, and these people  wanted nothing but bread. This great crowd invaded  the Assembly, “armed with scythes, sticks and pikes.  One tough old woman defiantly shouted into the debate,  “Who’s that talking down there? Make the chatterbox  shut up. That’s not the point: the point is that we want  bread.5 Hers was the genuine voice of the people, essential  to any understanding of the French Revolution. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" The National Assembly followed the king to Paris, and  the next two years, until September 1791, saw the consolidation  of the liberal revolution. Under middle-class  leadership, the National Assembly abolished the French  nobility as a legal order and pushed forward with the creation  of a constitutional monarchy, which Louis XVI reluctantly  agreed to accept in July 1790. In the final  constitution, the king remained the head of state, but all  lawmaking power was placed in the hands of the National  Assembly, elected by the economic upper half of French  males. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" New laws broadened women’s rights to seek divorce,  to inherit property, and to obtain financial support for illegitimate  children from fathers. But women were not allowed  to vote or hold political office for at least two "}

First, the great majority of comfortable, well- educated males in the National Assembly believed that  women should be limited to child rearing and domestic  duties and should leave politics and most public activities  to men, as Rousseau had advocated in his influential writings  (see page 607). Second, the delegates to the National  Assembly were convinced that political life in  absolutist France had been profoundly corrupt and that a  prime example of this corruption was the way that some  talented but immoral aristocratic women had used their  sexual charms to manipulate weak rulers and their ministers.  Thus delegates argued that excluding women from  politics would help create the civic virtue that had been  missing: pure, home-focused wives would raise the high- minded sons needed to govern the nation. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The National Assembly replaced the complicated  patchwork of historic provinces with eighty-three departments  of approximately equal size.

{"prompt":"","completion":" The Assembly also imposed a radical reorganization on  the country’s religious life. It granted religious freedom  to the small minority of French Jews and Protestants. Of  greater impact, it then nationalized the Catholic  Church’s property and abolished monasteries as useless  relics of a distant past. The government used all former  church property as collateral to guarantee a new paper  currency, the assignats, and then sold the property in an  attempt to put the state’s finances on a solid footing. Although  the church’s land was sold in large blocks, peasants  eventually purchased much when it was subdivided.  These purchases strengthened their attachment to the  new revolutionary order in the countryside. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The religious reorganization of France brought the  new government into conflict with the Catholic Church  and many sincere Christians, especially in the countryside.  Imbued with the rationalism and skepticism of the  eighteenth-century philosophes, many delegates distrusted  popular piety and “superstitious religion. Thus  they established a national church, with priests chosen  by voters. The National Assembly then forced the  Catholic clergy to take a loyalty oath to the new government.  The pope formally condemned this attempt to  subjugate the church, and only half the priests of France  swore the oath. The result was a deep religious divide  within the country and the clergy. The attempt to remake  the Catholic Church, like the Assembly’s abolition of  guilds and workers associations, sharpened the conflict  between the educated classes and the common people  that had been emerging in the eighteenth century. This  policy toward the church was the revolutionary government’s  first important failure. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Revolutionary Aspirations in  Saint-Domingue "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The French Revolution radically transformed not only  the territorial nation of France but its overseas colonies as  well. On the eve of the Revolution, Saint-Domingue—  the most profitable of all Caribbean colonies—was even  more rife with social tensions than France itself. In addition  to distinctions between noble and commoner or rich  and poor, Saint-Domingue harbored divisions between  free and unfree and a racial spectrum that included black,  mixed race, and white people. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The colony’s slave population was at least five hundred  thousand, in comparison to a white population of ap"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" proximately forty thousand. Because the brutal conditions  created very high death rates among slaves, traders  brought a constant stream of new arrivals from Africa. In  1789 up to two-thirds of slaves in Saint-Domingue had  been born in Africa, most in the west-central region of  the continent. Many were veterans of wars in Africa. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The free population was divided by color and by  wealth. The European population included French colonial  officials, wealthy planters and merchants, and poor  immigrants. A sizable population of free people of  African and mixed African European descent also existed,  who referred to themselves as “free coloreds or free  people of color. They varied from modest artisans, to  plantation managers and clerks, to wealthy established  planters who owned slaves themselves. Failing to achieve  their dreams of a colonial fortune, poor whites bitterly  resented the privileges of the others, especially the free- colored elite. The white elite harbored its own grudges  against France’s monopoly on colonial trade and the  royal government’s attempts in the 1780s to impose legislation  requiring humane treatment of slaves. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The 1685 Code noir (Black Code) that set the parameters  of slavery had granted free people of color the same  legal status as whites: they could own property, live  where they wished, and pursue any education or career  they desired. From the 1760s on, however, colonial administrators  began rescinding these rights, and by the  time of the Revolution, myriad aspects of free coloreds’  lives—from the professions they could practice, to the  names they could adopt, to the clothes they could  wear—were ruled by discriminatory laws. White planters  eagerly welcomed these laws, convinced that the best defense  of slavery was a rigid color line. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The political and intellectual turmoil of the 1780s,  with its growing rhetoric of liberty, equality, and fraternity,  raised new challenges and possibilities for each of  these groups. For slaves, news of abolitionist movements  in France, and the royal government’s own attempts to  rein in the worst abuses of slavery, led to hopes that the  mother country might grant them freedom. Free people  of color found in such rhetoric the principles on which  to base a defense of their legal and political rights. They  looked to political reforms in Paris as a means of gaining  political enfranchisement and reasserting equal status  with whites. The white elite, not surprisingly, saw matters  very differently. Infuriated by talk of abolition and determined  to protect their way of life, they looked to revolutionary  ideals of representative government for the  chance to gain control of their own affairs, as had the  American colonists before them.

{"prompt":"","completion":" The National Assembly, however, frustrated the hopes  of all these groups. Cowed by colonial representatives  who claimed that support for free coloreds would result in  slave insurrection and independence, the Assembly refused  to extend French constitutional safeguards to the  colonies. Instead, it ruled that each colony would draft its  own constitution, with free rein over decisions on slavery  and the enfranchisement of free people of color. After  dealing this blow to the aspirations of slaves and free coloreds,  the committee also reaffirmed French monopolies  over colonial trade, thereby angering planters as well. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In July 1790 Vincent Ogé, a free man of color, returned  to Saint-Domingue from Paris determined to redress  these issues. He raised an army of several hundred,  occupied the town of Grande-Rivière, and sent letters to  the new Provincial Assembly of Saint-Domingue demanding  political rights for all free citizens, a statute already  passed in France. After initial victories, his army  was defeated, and Ogé himself was tortured and executed.  In an attempt to forge compromise, in May 1791  the National Assembly granted political rights to free  people of color born to two free parents who possessed  sufficient property. When news of this legislation arrived  in Saint-Domingue, the white elite was furious and the  colonial governor refused to enact it. Violence now  erupted between groups of whites and free coloreds in  parts of the colony. The liberal revolution had failed to  satisfy the contradictory ambitions in the colonies. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" When Louis XVI accepted the final version of the National  Assembly’s constitution in September 1791, a  young and still obscure provincial lawyer and delegate  named Maximilien Robespierre (1758–1794) concluded,  “The Revolution is over. Robespierre was both  right and wrong. He was right in the sense that the most  constructive and lasting reforms were in place. Nothing  substantial in the way of liberty and fundamental reform  would be gained in the next generation. He was wrong  in the sense that a much more radical stage lay ahead.  New heroes and new ideologies were to emerge in revolutionary  wars and international conflict in which Robespierre  himself would play a central role. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" • How and why did the Revolution take a radical turn at  home and in the colonies?  Foreign Reactions and the  Beginning of War "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The outbreak and progress of revolution in France produced  great excitement and a sharp division of opinion  in Europe and the United States. Liberals and radicals  saw a mighty triumph of liberty over despotism. In Great  Britain especially, they hoped that the French example  would lead to a fundamental reordering of Parliament,  which was in the hands of the aristocracy and a few  wealthy merchants. After the French Revolution began,  conservative leaders such as Edmund Burke (1729–  1797) were deeply troubled by the aroused spirit of reform.  In 1790 Burke published Reflections on the Revolution  in France, one of the great defenses of European  conservatism. He defended inherited privileges in general  and those of the English monarchy and aristocracy.  He glorified the unrepresentative Parliament and predicted  that thoroughgoing reform like that occurring in  France would lead only to chaos and tyranny. Burke’s  work sparked much debate. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" One passionate rebuttal came from a young writer in  London, Mary Wollstonecraft (1759–1797). Born into  the middle class, Wollstonecraft was schooled in adversity  by a mean-spirited father who beat his wife and squandered  his inherited fortune. Determined to be independent  in a society that expected women of her class to  become obedient wives, she struggled for years to earn  her living as a governess and a teacher—practically the  only acceptable careers for single, educated women—  before attaining success as a translator and author. Incensed  by Burke’s book, Wollstonecraft immediately  wrote a blistering, widely read attack, A Vindication of the  Rights of Man (1790). "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Then she made a daring intellectual leap, developing  for the first time the logical implications of natural-law  philosophy in her masterpiece, A Vindication of the Rights  of Woman (1792). To fulfill the still-unrealized potential  of the French Revolution and to eliminate the sexual inequality  she had felt so keenly, she demanded that "}

Paralleling  ideas put forth independently in France by Olympe de  Gouges (1748–1793), a self-taught writer and woman of  the people (see the feature “Listening to the Past: Revolution  and Women’s Rights on pages 714–715), Wollstonecraft’s  work marked the birth of the modern women’s  movement for equal rights, and it was ultimately  very influential.

This carefully worded statement declared their willingness  to intervene in France in certain circumstances and  was expected to have a sobering effect on revolutionary  France without causing war. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But the crowned heads of Europe misjudged the revolutionary  spirit in France. When the National Assembly  disbanded, it sought popular support by decreeing that  none of its members would be eligible for election to the  new Legislative Assembly. This meant that when the new  representative body convened in October 1791, it had a  different character. The great majority of the legislators  were still prosperous, well-educated middle-class men,  but they were younger and less cautious than their predecessors.  Many of the deputies belonged to a political  club called the Jacobin club, after the name of the former  monastery in which they held their meetings. Such clubs  had proliferated in Parisian neighborhoods since the beginning  of the Revolution, drawing men and women to  debate the burning political questions of the day. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" The new representatives to the Assembly were passionately  committed to the Revolution and distrustful of  monarchy after Louis’s attempted flight. They increasingly  lumped “useless aristocrats and “despotic monarchs together,  and they whipped themselves into a patriotic fury  with bombastic oratory. If the courts of Europe were attempting  to incite a war of kings against France, then “we  will incite a war of people against kings. ...Ten million  Frenchmen, kindled by the fire of liberty, armed with the  sword, with reason, with eloquence would be able to  change the face of the world and make the tyrants tremble  on their thrones.8 Only Robespierre and a very few others  argued that people would not welcome liberation at  the point of a gun. Such warnings were brushed aside.  France would “rise to the full height of her mission, as  one deputy urged. In April 1792 France declared war on  Francis II, the Habsburg monarch. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" France’s crusade against tyranny went poorly at first.  Prussia joined Austria in the Austrian Netherlands  (present-day Belgium), and French forces broke and fled  at their first encounter with armies of this First Coalition.  The road to Paris lay open, and it is possible that only  conflict between the Eastern monarchs over the division  of Poland saved France from defeat. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Military reversals and patriotic fervor led the Legislative  Assembly to declare the country in danger. Volunteer  armies from the provinces streamed through Paris, fraternizing  with the people and singing patriotic songs like the  stirring “Marseillaise, later the French national anthem.  In this supercharged wartime atmosphere, rumors of treason  by the king and queen spread in Paris. On August 10,  1792, a revolutionary crowd attacked the royal palace at  the Tuileries, capturing it after heavy fighting with the  Swiss Guards. The king and his family fled for their lives  to the nearby Legislative Assembly, which suspended the  king from all his functions, imprisoned him, and called for  a new National Convention to be elected by universal  male suffrage.

It adopted a brand-new revolutionary  calendar, which eliminated saints’ days and renamed  the days and the months after the seasons of the  year. The republic energetically promoted broad, open- air, democratic festivals. These spectacles brought the  entire population together and sought to redirect the  people’s traditional enthusiasm for Catholic religious celebrations  to secular holidays instilling republican virtue  and a love of nation. These spectacles were less successful  in villages than in cities, where popular interest in politics  was greater and Catholicism was weaker. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" All the members of the National Convention were republicans,  and at the beginning almost all belonged to  the Jacobin club of Paris. But the Jacobins themselves  were increasingly divided into two bitterly competitive  groups—the Girondists, named after a department in  southwestern France that was home to several of their  leaders, and the Mountain, led by Robespierre and another  young lawyer, Georges Jacques Danton. The  Mountain was so called because its members sat on the  uppermost benches on the left side of the assembly hall.  A majority of the indecisive Convention members, seated  in the “Plain below, floated back and forth between the  rival factions. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This division emerged clearly after the National Convention  overwhelmingly convicted Louis XVI of treason.  The Girondists accepted his guilt but did not wish to put  the king to death. By a narrow majority, the Mountain  carried the day, and Louis was executed on January 21,  1793, on the newly invented guillotine. One of his last  statements was “I am innocent and shall die without fear.  I would that my death might bring happiness to the  French, and ward off the dangers which I foresee.9 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Both the Girondists and the Mountain were determined  to continue the “war against tyranny. The Prussians had  been stopped at the Battle of Valmy on September 20,  1792, one day before the republic was proclaimed. French  armies then invaded Savoy and captured Nice, moved into  the German Rhineland, and by November 1792 were occupying  the entire Austrian Netherlands. Everywhere they  went French armies of occupation chased the princes,  “abolished feudalism, and found support among some  peasants and middle-class people. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But the French armies also lived off the land, requisitioning  food and supplies and plundering local treasures.  The liberators looked increasingly like foreign invaders. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \f International tensions mounted. In February 1793 the  National Convention, at war with Austria and Prussia,  declared war on Britain, Holland, and Spain as well. Republican  France was now at war with almost all of  Europe, a great war that would last almost without  interruption until 1815. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As the forces of the First Coalition drove the French  from the Austrian Netherlands, peasants in western  France revolted against being drafted into the army. They  were supported and encouraged in their resistance by devout  Catholics, royalists, and foreign agents. In Paris the  National Convention was locked in a life-and-death political  struggle between the Girondists and the Mountain.  Both groups were sincere republicans, hating  privilege and wanting to temper economic liberalism  with social concern. Yet personal hatreds ran deep. The  Girondists feared a bloody dictatorship by the Mountain,  and the Mountain was no less convinced that the more  moderate Girondists would turn to conservatives and  even royalists in order to retain power. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With the middle-class delegates so bitterly divided, the  laboring poor of Paris emerged as the decisive political  factor. The laboring men and women of Paris always constituted— along with the peasantry in the summer of  1789—the elemental force that drove the Revolution  forward. It was the artisans, day laborers, market women,  and garment workers who had stormed the Bastille,  marched on Versailles, driven the king from the Tuileries,  and carried out the September Massacres. The laboring  poor and the petty traders were often known as the sans- culottes, “without breeches, because sans-culottes men  wore trousers instead of the knee breeches of the aristocracy  and the solid middle class. The immediate interests  of the sans-culottes were mainly economic, and in spring  1793 rapid inflation, unemployment, and food shortages  were again weighing heavily on poor families. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Moreover, by spring 1793 the sans-culottes had become  keenly interested in politics. Encouraged by the so- called angry men, such as the passionate young ex-priest  and journalist Jacques Roux, sans-culottes men and  women were demanding radical political action to guarantee  them their daily bread. At first the Mountain joined  the Girondists in rejecting these demands. But in the face  of military defeat, peasant revolt, and hatred of the  Girondists, the Mountain and especially Robespierre became  more sympathetic. The Mountain joined with sans- culottes activists in the city government to engineer a  popular uprising that forced the Convention to arrest  thirty-one Girondist deputies for treason on June 2. All  power passed to the Mountain. "}

The peasant revolt  spread, and the republic’s armies were driven back  on all fronts.

{"prompt":"","completion":" A year later, in July 1794, the Austrian Netherlands and  the Rhineland were once again in the hands of conquering  French armies, and the First Coalition was falling  apart. This remarkable change of fortune was due to the  revolutionary government’s success in harnessing, for  perhaps the first time in history, the explosive forces of a  planned economy, revolutionary terror, and modern nationalism  in a total war effort. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Robespierre and the Committee of Public Safety advanced  with implacable resolution on several fronts in  1793 and 1794. First, they collaborated with the fiercely  patriotic and democratic sans-culottes, who retained the  common people’s traditional faith in fair prices and a  moral economic order and who distrusted most wealthy  capitalists and all aristocrats. Thus Robespierre and his  coworkers established, as best they could, a planned  economy with egalitarian social overtones. Rather than  let supply and demand determine prices, the government  set maximum allowable prices for key products. Though  the state was too weak to enforce all its price regulations,  it did fix the price of bread in Paris at levels the poor  could afford. Rationing was introduced, and bakers were  permitted to make only the “bread of equality—a brown  bread made of a mixture of all available flours. White  bread and pastries were outlawed as luxuries. The poor of  Paris may not have eaten well, but at least they ate. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" They also worked, mainly to produce arms and munitions  for the war effort.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Second, while radical economic measures supplied the  poor with bread and the armies with weapons, the Reign  of Terror (1793–1794) used revolutionary terror to solidify  the home front. Special revolutionary courts responsible  only to Robespierre’s Committee of Public  Safety tried rebels and “enemies of the nation for political  crimes. Drawing on popular support centered in the  local Jacobin clubs, these local courts ignored normal legal  procedures and judged severely. Some forty thousand  French men and women were executed or died in prison.  Another three hundred thousand suspects were arrested. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Robespierre’s Reign of Terror is one of the most controversial  phases of the French Revolution.

{"prompt":"","completion":" The third and perhaps most decisive element in the  French republic’s victory over the First Coalition was its  ability to draw on the explosive power of patriotic dedication  to a national state and a national mission. An essential  part of modern nationalism, this commitment  was something new in history. With a common language  and a common tradition newly reinforced by the ideas of  popular sovereignty and democracy, large numbers of  French people were stirred by a common loyalty. They  developed an intense emotional commitment to the defense  of the nation, and they imagined the nation as a  great loving family that included all right-thinking patriots.  In such circumstances war was no longer the gentlemanly  game of the eighteenth century, but rather total  war, a life-and-death struggle between good and evil. "}

The Convention quickly used the army to  suppress these insurrections and made no concessions to  the poor.

Napoleon’s bargain with the solid middle class was codified  in the famous Civil Code of 1804, which reasserted  two of the fundamental principles of the liberal and essentially  moderate revolution of 1789: equality of all  male citizens before the law and absolute security of  wealth and private property. Napoleon and the leading  bankers of Paris established the privately owned Bank of  France, which loyally served the interests of both the  state and the financial oligarchy. Napoleon’s defense of  the new economic order also appealed successfully to  peasants, who had gained both land and status from the  revolutionary changes. Thus Napoleon reconfirmed the "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" At the same time Napoleon accepted and strengthened  the position of the French bureaucracy. Building on the  solid foundations that revolutionary governments had  inherited from the Old Regime, he perfected a thoroughly  centralized state. As recent scholarship shows,  Napoleon consolidated his rule by recruiting disillusioned  revolutionaries for the network of ministers, prefects,  and centrally appointed mayors that depended on  him and came to serve him well. Only former revolutionaries  who leaned too far to the left or to the right were  pushed to the sidelines.13 Nor were members of the old  nobility slighted. In 1800 and again in 1802 Napoleon  granted amnesty to one hundred thousand émigrés on  the condition that they return to France and take a loyalty  oath. Members of this returning elite soon ably occupied  many high posts in the expanding centralized state.  Only one thousand die-hard monarchists were exempted  and remained abroad. Napoleon also created a new imperial  nobility in order to reward his most talented generals  and officials. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Napoleon’s skill in gaining support from important  and potentially hostile groups is illustrated by his treatment  of the Catholic Church in France. In 1800 the  French clergy was still divided into two groups: those  who had taken an oath of allegiance to the revolutionary  government and those in exile or hiding who had refused  to do so. Personally uninterested in religion, Napoleon  wanted to heal the religious division so that a united  Catholic Church could serve as a bulwark of order and  social peace in France. After arduous negotiations,  Napoleon and Pope Pius VII (1800–1823) signed the  Concordat of 1801. The pope gained the precious right  for French Catholics to practice their religion freely, but  Napoleon gained political power: his government now  nominated bishops, paid the clergy, and exerted great influence  over the church in France.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Order and unity had a price: Napoleon’s authoritarian  rule. Women, who had often participated in revolutionary  politics without having legal equality, lost many of  the gains they had made in the 1790s.

"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Free speech and freedom of the press were continually  violated. By 1811 only four newspapers were left, and  they were little more than organs of government propaganda.  The occasional elections were a farce. Later laws  prescribed harsh penalties for political offenses. These  changes in the law were part of the creation of a police  state in France. Since Napoleon was usually busy making  war, this task was largely left to Joseph Fouché, an unscrupulous  opportunist who had earned a reputation  for brutality during the Reign of Terror. As minister of  police, Fouché organized a ruthlessly efficient spy system  that kept thousands of citizens under continual police  surveillance. People suspected of subversive activities  were arbitrarily detained, placed under house arrest, or  consigned to insane asylums. After 1810 political suspects  were held in state prisons, as they had been during  the Terror. There were about twenty-five hundred such  political prisoners in 1814. "}

When these overtures were rejected,  French armies led by Napoleon decisively defeated the  Austrians. In the Treaty of Lunéville (1801) Austria accepted  the loss of almost all its Italian possessions, and  German territory on the west bank of the Rhine was incorporated  into France.

{"prompt":"","completion":" In the midst of these victories, Napoleon was forced to  accept defeat overseas. With Toussaint L’Ouverture acting  increasingly as an independent ruler of the western  province of Saint-Domingue, another general, André  Rigaud, set up his own government in the southern  peninsula, which had long been more isolated from  France than the rest of the colony. Both leaders maintained  policies, initially established by the French, of requiring  former slaves to continue to work on their  plantations. They believed that reconstructing the plantation  economy was crucial to maintaining their military  and political victories, and they harshly suppressed resistance  from former slaves. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Tensions mounted, however, between L’Ouverture  and Rigaud. While L’Ouverture was a freed slave of  African descent, Rigaud belonged to the free colored  elite. This elite resented the growing power of former  slaves like L’Ouverture, who in turn accused them of  adopting the racism of white settlers. Civil war broke out  between the two sides in 1799, when L’Ouverture’s  forces, led by his lieutenant Jean Jacques Dessalines, invaded  the south. Victory over Rigaud gave Toussaint  control of the entire colony. (See the feature “Individuals  in Society: Toussaint L’Ouverture.) "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This victory was soon challenged by Napoleon’s arrival  in power. Napoleon intended to reinvigorate the  Caribbean plantation economy as a basis for expanding  French power. His new constitution of 1799 opened  the way for a re-establishment of slavery much feared "}

When the colonial assembly of Saint- Domingue, under L’Ouverture’s direction, drafted its  own constitution—which reaffirmed the abolition of slavery  and granted L’Ouverture governorship for life—  Napoleon viewed it as a seditious act. He ordered his  brother-in-law General Charles-Victor-Emmanuel Leclerc  to lead an expedition to the island to crush the new  regime. Napoleon placed a high premium on bringing the  colony to heel, writing to Leclerc: “Once the blacks have  been disarmed and the principal generals sent to France,  you will have done more for the commerce and civilization  of Europe than we have done in our most brilliant  campaigns. An officer sent to serve in the colony had a  more cynical interpretation, writing that he was being  sent to “fight with the Negroes for their own sugar.14 "}

Although  Toussaint L’Ouverture cooperated with the French and  turned his army over to them, Leclerc had him arrested  and deported to France, along with his family, where  he died in 1803. After arresting L’Ouverture, Leclerc  moved to defuse the threat posed by former slaves by taking  away their arms. This effort aroused armed resistance  on the plantations and led to the defection of the remnants  of L’Ouverture’s army. Jean Jacques Dessalines  united the resistance under his command and led them  to a crushing victory over the French forces. Of the fifty- eight thousand French soldiers, fifty thousand were  lost in combat and to disease. On January 1, 1804,  Dessalines formally declared the independence of Saint- Domingue and the creation of the new sovereign nation  of Haiti, the name used by the pre-Columbian inhabitants  of the island.

In the areas incorporated into  France and in the satellites (see Map 21.2), Napoleon introduced  many French laws, abolishing feudal dues and  serfdom where French revolutionary armies had not already  done so. Some of the peasants and middle class  benefited from these reforms. Yet Napoleon had to put  the prosperity and special interests of France first in order  to safeguard his power base. Levying heavy taxes in  money and men for his armies, he came to be regarded  more as a conquering tyrant than as an enlightened liberator.  Thus French rule sparked patriotic upheavals and  encouraged the growth of reactive nationalism, for individuals  in different lands learned to identify emotionally  with their own embattled national families as the French  had done earlier.

{"prompt":"","completion":" The first great revolt occurred in Spain. In 1808 a  coalition of Catholics, monarchists, and patriots rebelled  against Napoleon’s attempts to make Spain a French  satellite with a Bonaparte as its king. French armies occupied  Madrid, but the foes of Napoleon fled to the hills  and waged uncompromising guerrilla warfare. Spain was  a clear warning: resistance to French imperialism was  growing. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Grand Empire was at its height, Britain still remained at  war with France, helping the guerrillas in Spain and Portugal.  The continental system, organized to exclude  British goods from the continent and force that “nation  of shopkeepers to its knees, was a failure. Instead, it was  France that suffered from Britain’s counter-blockade,  which created hard times for French artisans and the  middle class. Perhaps looking for a scapegoat, Napoleon  turned on Alexander I of Russia, who in 1811 openly repudiated  Napoleon’s war of prohibitions against British  goods. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Napoleon’s invasion of Russia began in June 1812  with a force that eventually numbered 600,000, probably  the largest force yet assembled in a single army. Only  one-third of this Great Army was French, however; nationals  of all the satellites and allies were drafted into the  operation. Originally planning to winter in the Russian  city of Smolensk if Alexander did not sue for peace,  Napoleon reached Smolensk and recklessly pressed on  toward Moscow. The great Battle of Borodino that followed  was a draw, and the Russians retreated in good order.  Alexander ordered the evacuation of Moscow, which  then burned in part, and he refused to negotiate. Finally,  after five weeks in the abandoned city, Napoleon ordered  a retreat. That retreat was one of the greatest military disasters  in history. The Russian army, the Russian winter,  and starvation cut Napoleon’s army to pieces. When the  frozen remnants staggered into Poland and Prussia in  December, 370,000 men had died and another 200,000  had been taken prisoner.16 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Leaving his troops to their fate, Napoleon raced to  Paris to raise yet another army. Possibly he might still  have saved his throne if he had been willing to accept a  France reduced to its historical size—the proposal offered  by Austria’s foreign minister, Prince Klemens von  Metternich. But Napoleon refused. Austria and Prussia  deserted Napoleon and joined Russia and Great Britain  in the Treaty of Chaumont in March 1814, by which the  four powers pledged allegiance to defeat the French emperor.  All across Europe patriots called for a “war of  liberation against Napoleon’s oppression, and the well- disciplined regular armies of Napoleon’s enemies closed  in for the kill. Less than a month later, on April 4, 1814,  a defeated Napoleon abdicated his throne. After this  unconditional abdication, the victorious allies granted  Napoleon the island of Elba off the coast of Italy as his  own tiny state. Napoleon was even allowed to keep his  imperial title, and France was required to pay him a yearly  income of 2 million francs. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" The French Revolution was forged by multiple and complex  factors. Whereas an earlier generation of historians  was convinced that the origins of the Revolution lay in  class struggle between the entrenched nobility and the  rising bourgeoisie, it is now clear that many other factors  were involved. Certainly, French society had undergone  significant transformations during the eighteenth century,  which dissolved many economic and social differences  among elites without removing the legal distinction  between them. These changes were accompanied by political  struggles between the monarchy and its officers,  particularly in the high law courts. Emerging public  opinion focused on the shortcomings of monarchical  rule, and a rising torrent of political theory, cheap pamphlets,  gossip, and innuendo offered scathing and even  pornographic depictions of the king and his court. With  their sacred royal aura severely tarnished, Louis XV and  his successor Louis XVI found themselves unable to respond  to the financial crises generated by French involvement  in the Seven Years’ War and the American  Revolution. Louis XVI’s half-hearted efforts to redress  the situation were quickly overwhelmed by elite and popular  demands for fundamental reform. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" the National Assembly had eliminated Old Regime privileges  and had established a constitutional monarchy.  Talk in France of liberty, equality, and fraternity raised  new and contradictory aspirations in the colony of Saint- Domingue. White planters lobbied for increased colonial  autonomy; free people of color sought the return of legal  equality; slaves of African birth or descent took direct action  on revolutionary ideals by rising in rebellion against  their masters. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With the execution of the royal couple and the declaration  of terror as the order of the day, the French Revolution  took an increasingly radical turn from the end of  1792. Popular fears of counter-revolutionary conspiracy  combined with the outbreak of war against a mighty alliance  of European monarchs convinced many that the  Revolution was vulnerable and must be defended against  its multiple enemies. In a spiraling cycle of accusations  and executions, the Jacobins eliminated political opponents  and then factions within its own party. The Directory  government that took power after the fall of  Robespierre restored political equilibrium at the cost  of the radical platform of social equality he had pursued. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Wearied by the weaknesses of the Directory, a group  of conspirators gave Napoleon Bonaparte control of  France. His brilliant reputation as a military leader and  his charisma and determination made him seem ideal to  lead France to victory over its enemies. As is so often the  case in history, Napoleon’s relentless ambitions ultimately  led to his downfall.

Excerpted here, de  Gouges’s manifesto went beyond the 1789 Rights of  Man. It called on males to end their oppression of  women and to give women equal rights.

III. The principle of all sovereignty rests  essentially with the nation, which is nothing but  the union of woman and man. . . .  IV. Liberty and justice consist of restoring all  that belongs to others; thus, the only limits on  the exercise of the natural rights of woman are  perpetual male tyranny; these limits are to be  reformed by the laws of nature and reason.

No one is to be disquieted for his very basic  opinions; woman has the right to mount the  scaffold; she must equally have the right to mount  the rostrum, provided that her demonstrations do  not disturb the legally established public order.  XI. The free communication of thoughts and  opinions is one of the most precious rights of  woman, since that liberty assures the recognition  of children by their fathers. Any female citizen  thus may say freely, I am the mother of a child  which belongs to you, without being forced by a  barbarous prejudice to hide the truth. . . .  XIII. For the support of the public force and  the expenses of administration, the contributions  of woman and man are equal; she shares all the  duties . . . and all the painful tasks; therefore, she  must have the same share in the distribution of  positions, employment, offices, honors, and  jobs. . . .  XIV. Female and male citizens have the right  to verify, either by themselves or through their  representatives, the necessity of the public  contribution. This can only apply to women if  they are granted an equal share, not only of  wealth, but also of public administration. . . .  XV.

No society has a constitution without the  guarantee of rights and the separation of powers;  the constitution is null if the majority of  individuals comprising the nation have not  cooperated in drafting it.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Unfortunately, the improvement in the European standard of living  was quite limited until about 1850 for at least two reasons. First, even in  Britain, only a few key industries experienced a technological revolution.  Many more industries continued to use old methods, especially on the  continent, and this held down the increase in total production. Second,  the increase in total population, which began in the eighteenth century  (see pages 625–628), continued all across Europe as the era of the Industrial  Revolution unfolded. As a result, the rapid growth in population  threatened to eat up the growth in production and to leave most individuals  poorer than ever. As a consequence, rapid population growth  provided a somber background for European industrialization and made  the wrenching transformation all the more difficult. "}

It changed patterns of work, transformed the social class structure  and the way people thought about class, and eventually even altered the  international balance of political power.

{"prompt":"","completion":" The Industrial Revolution  in Britain "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain, that  historic union of Scotland, Wales, and England—the  wealthiest and the dominant part of the country. It  was something new in history, and it was quite unplanned.  With no models to copy and no idea of what  to expect, Britain had to pioneer not only in industrial  technology but also in social relations and urban living.  Between 1793 and 1815, these formidable tasks  were complicated by almost constant war with France.  As the trailblazer in economic development, as France  was in political change, Britain must command special  attention. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" • What were the origins of the Industrial Revolution in  Britain, and how did it develop between 1780 and 1850?  Eighteenth-Century Origins "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Although many aspects of the British Industrial Revolution  are still matters for scholarly debate, it is generally  agreed that the industrial changes that did occur grew out  of a long process of development. First, the expanding  Atlantic economy of the eighteenth century served mercantilist  Britain remarkably well. The colonial empire that  Britain aggressively built, augmented by a strong position  in Latin America and in the African slave trade, provided  a growing market for British manufactured goods. So did  the domestic market. In an age when it was much cheaper  to ship goods by water than by land, no part of England  was more than twenty miles from navigable water. Beginning  in the 1770s, a canal-building boom greatly enhanced  this natural advantage (see Map 22.1). Rivers and  canals provided easy movement of England’s and Wales’s  enormous deposits of iron and coal, resources that would  be critical raw materials in Europe’s early industrial age.  Nor were there any tariffs within the country to hinder  trade, as there were in France before 1789 and in politically  fragmented Germany. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Second, agriculture played a central role in bringing  about the Industrial Revolution in Britain. English farmers  in particular were second only to the Dutch in productivity  in 1700, and they were continually adopting  new methods of farming as the century went on. The  result, especially before 1760, was a period of bountiful  crops and low food prices. The ordinary English family  did not have to spend almost everything it earned just to "}

It could spend more on, for example, manufactured  goods—leather shoes or a razor for the man, a  bonnet or a shawl for the woman, toy soldiers for the  son, and a doll for the daughter. Thus demand for goods  within the country complemented the demand from the  colonies. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Third, Britain had other assets that helped give rise to  industrial leadership. Unlike eighteenth-century France,  Britain had an effective central bank and well-developed  credit markets. The monarchy and the aristocratic oligarchy,  which had jointly ruled the country since 1688,  provided stable and predictable government. At the same  time, the government let the domestic economy operate "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \f 719 719  with few controls, encouraging personal initiative, technical  change, and a free market. Finally, Britain had long  had a large class of hired agricultural laborers, rural proletarians  whose numbers were further increased by the  second great round of enclosures in the late eighteenth  century. These rural wage earners were relatively mobile—  compared to village-bound peasants in France and western  Germany, for example—and along with cottage  workers they formed a potential industrial labor force for  capitalist entrepreneurs. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" All these factors combined to initiate the Industrial  Revolution, a term first coined by awed contemporaries  in the 1830s to describe the burst of major inventions  and technical changes they had witnessed in certain industries.  This technical revolution went hand in hand  with an impressive quickening in the annual rate of industrial  growth in Britain. Whereas industry had grown  at only 0.7 percent between 1700 and 1760 (before the  Industrial Revolution), it grew at the much higher rate  of 3 percent between 1801 and 1831 (when industrial  transformation was in full swing).1 The decisive quickening  of growth probably came in the 1780s, after the  American War of Independence and just before the  French Revolution. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Therefore, the great economic and political revolutions  that shaped the modern world occurred almost simultaneously,  though they began in different countries.  The Industrial Revolution was, however, a longer process  than the political upheavals. It was not complete in  Britain until 1850 at the earliest, and it had no real impact  on continental countries until after 1815. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The First Factories "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The pressure to produce more goods for a growing market  was directly related to the first decisive breakthrough  of the Industrial Revolution—the creation of the world’s  first large factories in the British cotton textile industry.  Technological innovations in the manufacture of cotton  cloth led to a new system of production and social relationships.  Since no other industry experienced such a  rapid or complete transformation before 1830, these  trailblazing developments deserve special consideration. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Although the putting-out system of merchant capitalism  (see page 629) was expanding all across Europe in  the eighteenth century, this pattern of rural industry was  most fully developed in Britain. There, under the pressure  of growing demand, the system’s limitations began  to outweigh its advantages for the first time. This was especially  true in the British textile industry after about  1760. "}

Many  a tinkering worker knew that a better spinning wheel  promised rich rewards. It proved hard to spin the traditional  raw materials—wool and flax—with improved machines,  but cotton was different. Cotton textiles had first  been imported into Britain from India by the East India  Company, and by 1760 there was a tiny domestic industry  in northern England. After many experiments over a  generation, a gifted carpenter and jack-of-all-trades, James  Hargreaves, invented his cotton-spinning jenny about  1765. At almost the same moment, a barber-turnedmanufacturer  named Richard Arkwright invented (or  possibly pirated) another kind of spinning machine, the  water frame. These breakthroughs produced an explosion  in the infant cotton textile industry in the 1780s,  when it was increasing the value of its output at an unprecedented  rate of about 13 percent each year. By 1790  the new machines were producing ten times as much cotton  yarn as had been made in 1770. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Hargreaves’s spinning jenny was simple and inexpensive.  In early models, from six to twenty-four spindles  were mounted on a sliding carriage, and each spindle  spun a fine, slender thread. The woman moved the carriage  back and forth with one hand and turned a wheel to  supply power with the other. Now it was the male weaver  who could not keep up with the vastly more efficient female  spinner. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Arkwright’s water frame employed a different principle.  It quickly acquired a capacity of several hundred  spindles and demanded much more power—waterpower.  The water frame thus required large specialized mills,  factories that employed as many as one thousand workers  from the very beginning. The water frame could spin only  coarse, strong thread, which was then put out for respinning  on hand-powered cottage jennies. Around 1790 an  alternative technique invented by Samuel Crompton also  began to require more power than the human arm could  supply. After that time, all cotton spinning was gradually  concentrated in factories. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" The loose cotton strands on the  slanted bobbins passed up to the  sliding carriage and then on to the  spindles in back for fine spinning.  The worker, almost always a  woman, regulated the sliding  carriage with one hand, and with  the other she turned the crank on  the wheel to supply power. By  1783 one woman could spin by  hand a hundred threads at a time  on an improved model. (Mary  Evans Picture Library) "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Cotton goods became much cheaper, and they were  bought and treasured by all classes. In the past, only the  wealthy could afford the comfort and cleanliness of underwear,  which was called body linen because it was  made from expensive linen cloth. Now millions of poor  people, who had earlier worn nothing underneath their  coarse, filthy outer garments, could afford to wear cotton  slips and underpants as well as cotton dresses and shirts. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Families using cotton in cottage industry were freed  from their constant search for adequate yarn from scattered,  part-time spinners, since all the thread needed  could be spun in the cottage on the jenny or obtained  from a nearby factory. The wages of weavers, now hard- pressed to keep up with the spinners, rose markedly until  about 1792. Weavers were among the best-paid workers  in England. They were known to walk proudly through  the streets with 5-pound notes stuck in their hatbands,  and they dressed like the middle class. As a result, large  numbers of agricultural laborers became hand-loom  weavers, while mechanics and capitalists sought to invent  a power loom to save on labor costs. This Edmund  Cartwright achieved in 1785. But the power looms of the  factories worked poorly at first, and hand-loom weavers  continued to receive good wages until at least 1800. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Working conditions in the early factories were less satisfactory  than those of cottage weavers and spinners, and "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \f people were reluctant to work in them. Therefore, factory  owners often turned to young children who had been  abandoned by their parents and put in the care of local  parishes. Parish officers often “apprenticed such unfortunate  foundlings to factory owners. The parish thus saved  money, and the factory owners gained workers over whom  they exercised almost the authority of slave owners. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Apprenticed as young as five or six years of age, boy  and girl workers were forced by law to labor for their  “masters for as many as fourteen years. Housed, fed,  and locked up nightly in factory dormitories, the young  workers received little or no pay. Hours were appalling—  commonly thirteen or fourteen hours a day, six days a  week. Harsh physical punishment maintained brutal discipline.  To be sure, poor children typically worked long  hours and frequently outside the home for brutal masters.  But the wholesale coercion of orphans as factory  apprentices constituted exploitation on a truly unprecedented  scale. This exploitation ultimately piqued the  conscience of reformers and reinforced more humanitarian  attitudes toward children and their labor in the early  nineteenth century. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The creation of the world’s first modern factories in  the British cotton textile industry in the 1770s and 1780s,  which grew out of the putting-out system of cottage production,  was a major historical development. Both symbolically  and substantially, the big new cotton mills marked  the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in Britain. By  1831 the largely mechanized cotton textile industry towered  above all others, accounting for fully 22 percent of  the country’s entire industrial production. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Problem of Energy "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The growth of the cotton textile industry might have  been stunted or cut short, however, if water from rivers  and streams had remained the primary source of power  for the new factories. But this did not occur. Instead, an  epoch-making solution was found to the age-old problem  of energy and power. This solution permitted continued  rapid development in cotton textiles, the gradual  generalization of the factory system, and the triumph of  the Industrial Revolution in Britain. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Human beings have long used their toolmaking abilities  to construct machines that convert one form of energy  into another for their own benefit. In the medieval  period, people began to develop water mills to grind their  grain and windmills to pump water and drain swamps.  More efficient use of water and wind in the sixteenth and  seventeenth centuries enabled human beings to accomplish  more; intercontinental sailing ships were a prime  example. Nevertheless, even into the eighteenth century, "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 721  society continued to rely for energy mainly on plants, and  human beings and animals continued to perform most  work. This dependence meant that Western civilization  remained poor in energy and power. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Lack of power lay at the heart of the poverty that afflicted  the large majority of people. The man behind the  plow and the woman at the spinning wheel could employ  only horsepower and human muscle in their labor. No  matter how hard they worked, they could not produce  very much. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The shortage of energy had become particularly severe  in Britain by the eighteenth century. Because of the growth  of population, most of the great forests of medieval Britain  had long ago been replaced by fields of grain and hay.  Wood was in ever-shorter supply, yet it remained tremendously  important. It served as the primary source of heat  for all homes and industries and as a basic raw material.  Processed wood (charcoal) was the fuel that was mixed  with iron ore in the blast furnace to produce pig iron. The  iron industry’s appetite for wood was enormous, and by  1740 the British iron industry was stagnating. Vast forests  enabled Russia to become the world’s leading producer of  iron, much of which was exported to Britain. But Russia’s  potential for growth was limited, too, and in a few decades  Russia would reach the barrier of inadequate energy that  was already holding England back. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Steam Engine Breakthrough "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As this early energy crisis grew worse, Britain looked  toward its abundant and widely scattered reserves of coal  as an alternative to its vanishing wood. Coal was first used  in Britain in the late Middle Ages as a source of heat. By  1640 most homes in London were heated with it, and it  also provided heat for making beer, glass, soap, and other  products. Coal was not used, however, to produce mechanical  energy or to power machinery. It was there that  coal’s potential was enormous, as a simple example shows. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A hard-working miner can dig out 500 pounds of coal  a day using hand tools. Even an extremely inefficient  converter, which transforms only 1 percent of the heat  energy in coal into mechanical energy, will produce 27  horsepower-hours of work from that 500 pounds of coal.  The miner, by contrast, produces only about 1 horsepower- hour in the course of a day. Early steam engines were powerful  but still inefficient converters of energy. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As more coal was produced, mines were dug deeper  and deeper and were constantly filling with water.

{"prompt":"","completion":" In the early 1760s, a gifted young Scot named James  Watt (1736–1819) was drawn to a critical study of the  steam engine. Watt was employed at the time by the University  of Glasgow as a skilled craftsman making scientific  instruments. The Scottish universities were pioneers in  practical technical education, and in 1763 Watt was  called on to repair a Newcomen engine being used in a  physics course. After a series of observations, Watt saw  that the Newcomen engine’s waste of energy could be  reduced by adding a separate condenser. This splendid "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" To invent something in a laboratory is one thing; to  make it a practical success is quite another. Watt needed  skilled workers, precision parts, and capital, and the relatively  advanced nature of the British economy proved essential.  A partnership with a wealthy English toymaker  provided risk capital and a manufacturing plant. In the  craft tradition of locksmiths, tinsmiths, and millwrights,  Watt found skilled mechanics who could install, regulate,  and repair his sophisticated engines. From ingenious  manufacturers such as the cannonmaker John Wilkinson,  Watt was gradually able to purchase precision parts. This  support allowed him to create an effective vacuum and  regulate a complex engine. In more than twenty years of  constant effort, Watt made many further improvements.  By the late 1780s, the steam engine had become a practical  and commercial success in Britain. "}

For the first time, abundance  was at least a possibility for ordinary men and women. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The steam engine was quickly put to use in several industries  in Britain. It drained mines and made possible  the production of ever more coal to feed steam engines  elsewhere. The steam-power plant began to replace waterpower  in the cotton-spinning mills during the 1780s,  contributing greatly to that industry’s phenomenal rise.  Steam also took the place of waterpower in flour mills,  in the malt mills used in breweries, in the flint mills supplying  the china industry, and in the mills exported by  Britain to the West Indies to crush sugar cane. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Steam power promoted important breakthroughs in  other industries. The British iron industry was radically  transformed. The use of powerful, steam-driven bellows  in blast furnaces helped ironmakers switch over rapidly  from limited charcoal to unlimited coke (which is made  from coal) in the smelting of pig iron after 1770. In the  1780s, Henry Cort developed the puddling furnace, "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" The economic consequence of these technical innovations  was a great boom in the British iron industry. In  1740 annual British iron production was only 17,000  tons. With the spread of coke smelting and the first impact  of Cort’s inventions, production reached 68,000  tons in 1788, 125,000 tons in 1796, and 260,000 tons  in 1806.

In all countries, the construction of railroads created a  strong demand for unskilled labor and contributed to the  growth of a class of urban workers. Hard work on construction  gangs was done in the open air with animals and  hand tools. Many landless farm laborers and poor peasants,  long accustomed to leaving their villages for temporary  employment, went to build railroads. By the time the work  was finished, life back home in the village often seemed  dull and unappealing, and many men drifted to towns in  search of work. By the time they sent for their wives and  sweethearts to join them, they had become urban workers.  The railroad changed the outlook and values of the entire  society. The last and culminating invention of the Industrial  Revolution, the railroad dramatically revealed  the power and increased the speed of the new age. Racing  down a track at sixteen miles per hour or, by 1850, at  a phenomenal fifty miles per hour was a new and awesome  experience. As a French economist put it after a  ride on the Liverpool and Manchester in 1833, “There  are certain impressions that one cannot put into words!  Some great painters, notably Joseph M. W. Turner  (1775–1851) and Claude Monet (1840–1926), succeeded  in expressing this sense of power and awe. So did  the massive new train stations, the cathedrals of the industrial  age. Leading railway engineers such as Isambard  Kingdom Brunel and Thomas Brassey, whose tunnels  pierced mountains and whose bridges spanned valleys,  became public idols—the astronauts of their day. Everyday  speech absorbed the images of railroading. After you  got up a “full head of steam, you “highballed along.  And if you didn’t “go off the track, you might “toot  your own whistle. The railroad fired the imagination.  Industry and Population  In 1851 London was the site of a famous industrial fair.  This Great Exhibition was held in the newly built Crystal  Palace, an architectural masterpiece made entirely of  glass and iron, both of which were now cheap and abundant.  For the millions who visited, one fact stood out:  the little island of Britain was the “workshop of the  world. It alone produced two-thirds of the world’s coal  and more than one-half of its iron and cotton cloth.  More generally, it has been carefully estimated that in  1860 Britain produced a truly remarkable 20 percent of  the entire world’s output of industrial goods, whereas it  had produced only about 2 percent of the world total in  1750.2 Experiencing revolutionary industrial change,  Britain became the first industrial nation (see Map 22.2).  As the British economy significantly increased its production  of manufactured goods, the gross national product  (GNP) rose roughly fourfold at constant prices  between 1780 and 1851. In other words, the British  people as a whole increased their wealth and their national  income dramatically. At the same time, the population  of Britain boomed, growing from about 9 million in  1780 to almost 21 million in 1851. Thus growing numbers  consumed much of the increase in total production.  According to one important study, average consumption  per person increased by only 75 percent between 1780  and 1851, as the growth in the total population ate up a  large part of the fourfold increase in GNP in those years.3  Although the question is still debated, many economic  historians now believe that rapid population growth in  The Industrial Revolution in Britain • 725  North  I r i s h S e a Sea  E n g l i s h C h a n n e l  Bradford Leeds  Sheffield  Manchester  Liverpool  Birmingham  Bristol  London  WALES  SCOTLAND  Cotton and woolen textiles  Machinery  Iron  Iron  Hardware  Iron  Machinery  Pottery  Iron  Tin and copper  mining  Machinery  Consumer goods  0 50 Km  0 50 Mi  Towns with over 20,000  people are shown  Cities with over 100,000  people are labeled  Exposed coalfields  Industrial areas  Principal railroads  50  Thousand Million  400 2.4  MAP 22.2 The Industrial Revolution in England,  ca 1850 Industry concentrated in the rapidly growing  cities of the north and the Midlands, where rich coal  and iron deposits were in close proximity.

More people meant a more mobile  labor force, with a wealth of young workers in need of  employment and ready to go where the jobs were. Contemporaries  were much less optimistic. In his famous and  influential Essay on the Principle of Population (1798),  Thomas Malthus (1766–1834) argued that population  would always tend to grow faster than the food supply. In  Malthus’s opinion, the only hope of warding off such  “positive checks to population growth as war, famine,  and disease was “prudential restraint. That is, young  men and women had to limit the growth of population  by the old tried-and-true means of marrying late in life.  But Malthus was not optimistic about this possibility.  The powerful attraction of the sexes would cause most  people to marry early and have many children. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Wealthy English stockbroker and leading economist  David Ricardo (1772–1823) coldly spelled out the pessimistic  implications of Malthus’s thought. Ricardo’s depressing  iron law of wages posited that because of the  pressure of population growth, wages would always sink  to subsistence level. That is, wages would be just high  enough to keep workers from starving. With Malthus and  Ricardo setting the tone, economics was soon dubbed  “the dismal science. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Industrialization in  Continental Europe "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The new technologies developed in the British Industrial  Revolution were adopted rather slowly by businesses in  continental Europe. Yet by the end of the nineteenth  century, several European countries as well as the United  States had also industrialized their economies to a considerable  but variable degree. This meant that the process  of Western industrialization proceeded gradually,  with uneven jerks and national (and regional) variations. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Scholars are still struggling to explain these variations,  especially since good answers may offer valuable lessons  in our own time for poor countries seeking to improve  their material condition through industrialization and  economic development. The latest findings on the Western  experience are encouraging. They suggest that there  were alternative paths to the industrial world in the nineteenth  century and that, today as then, there was no need  to follow a rigid, predetermined British model. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" • How after 1815 did continental countries respond to the  challenge of industrialization?  National Variations "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" European industrialization, like most economic developments,  requires some statistical analysis as part of the effort  to understand it. Comparative data on industrial  production in different countries over time help give us  an overview of what happened. One set of data, the work  of a Swiss scholar, compares the level of industrialization  on a per capita basis in several countries from 1750 to  1913. These data are far from perfect because there are  gaps in the underlying records. But they reflect basic  trends and are presented in Table 22.1 for closer study. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As the heading of Table 22.1 makes clear, this is a per  capita comparison of levels of industrialization—a comparison  of how much industrial product was produced,  on average, for each person in a given country in a given "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Industrialization in Continental Europe • "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 727  year. Therefore, all the numbers in Table 22.1 are expressed  in terms of a single index number of 100, which  equals the per capita level of industrial goods in Great  Britain (and Ireland) in 1900. Every number in the table  is thus a percentage of the 1900 level in Britain and is directly  comparable with other numbers. The countries are  listed in roughly the order that they began to use large- scale, power-driven technology. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What does this overview of European industrialization  tell us? First, and very significantly, one sees in the first column  that in 1750 all countries were fairly close together  and that Britain was only slightly ahead of its archenemy,  France. Second, the column headed 1800 shows that  Britain had opened up a noticeable lead over all continental  countries by 1800, and that gap progressively widened  as the British Industrial Revolution accelerated to 1830  and reached full maturity by 1860. The British level of per  capita industrialization was twice the French level in 1830,  for example, and more than three times the French level in  1860. All other large countries (except the United States)  had fallen even further behind Britain than France had at  both dates. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Third, variations in the timing and in the extent of industrialization  in the continental powers and the United  States are also apparent. Belgium, independent in 1831  and rich in iron and coal, led in adopting Britain’s new  technology, and it experienced a truly revolutionary surge  between 1830 and 1860. France developed factory production  more gradually, and most historians now detect no  burst in French mechanization and no acceleration in the  growth of overall industrial output that may accurately be  called revolutionary. They stress instead France’s relatively  good pattern of early industrial growth, which was unjustly  tarnished by the spectacular rise of Germany and the  United States after 1860. In general, eastern and southern  Europe began the process of modern industrialization later  than northwestern and central Europe. Nevertheless, these  regions made real progress in the late nineteenth century,  as growth after 1880 in Austria-Hungary, Italy, and Russia  suggests. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Finally, the late but substantial industrialization in eastern  and southern Europe meant that all European states  (as well as the United States, Canada, and Japan) managed  to raise per capita industrial levels in the nineteenth century.  These continent-wide increases stood in stark contrast  to the large and tragic decreases that occurred at the same  time in many non-Western countries, most notably in  China and India, as Table 22.1 clearly shows. European  countries industrialized to a greater or lesser extent even as  most of the non-Western world de-industrialized. Thus differential  rates of wealth- and power-creating industrial development,  which heightened disparities within Europe, "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" The Challenge of Industrialization "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The different patterns of industrial development suggest  that the process of industrialization was far from automatic.  Indeed, building modern industry was an awesome  challenge. To be sure, throughout Europe the  eighteenth century was an era of agricultural improvement,  population increase, expanding foreign trade, and  growing cottage industry. Thus when the pace of British  industry began to accelerate in the 1780s, continental  businesses began to adopt the new methods as they  proved their profitability. British industry enjoyed clear  superiority, but at first the continent was close behind. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" By 1815, however, the situation was quite different. In  spite of wartime difficulties, British industry maintained  the momentum of the 1780s and continued to grow and  improve between 1789 and 1815. On the continent, the "}

War severed normal  communications between Britain and the continent,  severely handicapping continental efforts to use new  British machinery and technology. Moreover, the years  from 1789 to 1815 were, even for the privileged French  economy receiving special favors from Napoleon, a time  of “national catastrophe—in the graphic words of a famous  French scholar.4 Thus France and the rest of Europe  were further behind Britain in 1815 than in 1789. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This widening gap made it more difficult, if not impossible,  for other countries to follow the British pattern  in energy and industry after peace was restored in 1815.  Above all, in the newly mechanized industries, British  goods were being produced very economically, and these  goods had come to dominate world markets completely  while the continental states were absorbed in war between  1792 and 1815. In addition, British technology  had become so advanced and complicated that very few  engineers or skilled technicians outside England understood  it. Moreover, the technology of steam power had "}

It involved large investments  in the iron and coal industries and, after 1830, required  the existence of railroads, which were very costly.

All these disadvantages slowed the  spread of modern industry (see Map 22.3). "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" After 1815, however, when continental countries began  to face up to the British challenge, they had at  least three important advantages.

They had  strong independent governments, which did not fall under  foreign political control. These governments could  fashion economic policies to serve their own interests, as  they proceeded to do. They would eventually use the  power of the state to promote industry and catch up with  Britain. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Agents of Industrialization "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The British realized the great value of their technical discoveries  and tried to keep their secrets to themselves. Until  1825 it was illegal for artisans and skilled mechanics to  leave Britain; until 1843 the export of textile machinery  and other equipment was forbidden. Many talented, ambitious  workers, however, slipped out of the country illegally  and introduced the new methods abroad. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" One such man was William Cockerill, a Lancashire carpenter.  He and his sons began building cotton-spinning  equipment in French-occupied Belgium in 1799. In  1817 the most famous son, John Cockerill, purchased  the old summer palace of the deposed bishops of Liège in  southern Belgium. Cockerill converted the palace into a  large industrial enterprise, which produced machinery,  steam engines, and then railway locomotives. He also established  modern ironworks and coal mines. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Cockerill’s plants in the Liège area became an industrial  nerve center, continually gathering new information  and transmitting it across Europe. Many skilled British  workers came illegally to work for Cockerill, and some  went on to found their own companies throughout Europe.  Newcomers brought the latest plans and secrets, so  Cockerill could boast that ten days after an industrial advance  occurred in Britain, he knew all about it in Belgium.  Thus British technicians and skilled workers were a  powerful force in the spread of early industrialization. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A second agent of industrialization were talented entrepreneurs  such as Fritz Harkort, a business pioneer in  the German machinery industry. Serving in England as  a Prussian army officer during the Napoleonic wars,  Harkort was impressed and enchanted with what he saw.  He concluded that Germany had to match all these English  achievements as quickly as possible. Setting up shop  in an abandoned castle in the still-tranquil Ruhr Valley,  Harkort felt an almost religious calling to build steam engines  and become the “Watt of Germany. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Harkort’s basic idea was simple, but it was enormously  difficult to carry out. Lacking skilled laborers to do the  job, Harkort turned to England for experienced, though  expensive, mechanics. Getting materials also posed a  great problem. He had to import the thick iron boilers  that he needed from England at great cost. In spite of all  these problems, Harkort built and sold engines, winning  fame and praise. His ambitious efforts over sixteen years  also resulted in large financial losses for himself and his  partners, and in 1832 he was forced out of his company  by his financial backers, who cut back operations to reduce  losses. His career illustrates both the great efforts of  a few important business leaders to duplicate the British  achievement and the difficulty of the task. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Entrepreneurs like Harkort were obviously exceptional.  Most continental businesses adopted factory technology  slowly, and handicraft methods lived on. Indeed, continental  industrialization usually brought substantial but  uneven expansion of handicraft industry in both rural and  urban areas for a time. Artisan production of luxury items  grew in France as the rising income of the international  middle class created foreign demand for silk scarfs, embroidered  needlework, perfumes, and fine wines. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Government Support  and Corporate Banking "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Another major force in continental industrialization was  government, which often helped business people in continental  countries to overcome some of their difficulties.  Tariff protection was one such support. For example,  after Napoleon’s wars ended in 1815, France was suddenly  flooded with cheaper and better British goods. The  French government responded by laying high tariffs on  many British imports in order to protect the French economy.  After 1815 continental governments bore the cost  of building roads and canals to improve transportation. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" They also bore to a significant extent the cost of building  railroads. Belgium led the way in the 1830s and  1840s. In an effort to tie the newly independent nation  together, the Belgian government decided to construct a  state-owned system. Built rapidly as a unified network,  Belgium’s state-owned railroads stimulated the development  of heavy industry and made the country an early industrial  leader. Several of the smaller German states also  built state systems. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Prussian government provided another kind of invaluable  support. It guaranteed that the state treasury  would pay the interest and principal on railroad bonds if  the closely regulated private companies in Prussia were "}

In France the  state shouldered all the expense of acquiring and laying  roadbed, including bridges and tunnels. Finished roadbed  was leased to a carefully supervised private company,  which usually benefited from a state guarantee of its debts.  In short, governments helped pay for railroads, the all- important leading sector in continental industrialization. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The career of German journalist and thinker Friedrich  List (1789–1846) reflects government’s greater role in industrialization  on the continent than in England. List considered  the growth of modern industry of the  utmost importance because manufacturing was a primary  means of increasing people’s well-being and relieving their  poverty. Moreover, List was a dedicated nationalist. He  wrote that the “wider the gap between the backward and  advanced nations becomes, the more dangerous it is to remain  behind. An agricultural nation was not only poor but "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" also weak, increasingly unable to defend itself and maintain  its political independence. To promote industry was to defend  the nation. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The practical policies that List focused on in articles  and in his influential National System of Political Economy  (1841) were railroad building and the tariff. List  supported the formation of a customs union, or Zollverein,  among the separate German states. Such a tariff  union came into being in 1834, allowing goods to move  between the German member states without tariffs, while  erecting a single uniform tariff against other nations. List  wanted a high protective tariff, which would encourage  infant industries, allowing them to develop and eventually  hold their own against their more advanced British  counterparts. List denounced the British doctrine of free  trade as little more than Britain’s attempt “to make the  rest of the world, like the Hindus, its serfs in all industrial  and commercial relations.

{"prompt":"","completion":" economic nationalism had become increasingly popular  in Germany and elsewhere. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Finally, banks, like governments, also played a larger  and more creative role on the continent than in Britain.  Previously, almost all banks in Europe had been private,  organized as secretive partnerships. Because of the possibility  of unlimited financial loss, the partners of private  banks tended to be quite conservative and were content  to deal with a few rich clients and a few big merchants.  They generally avoided industrial investment as being  too risky. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the 1830s, two important Belgian banks pioneered  in a new direction. They received permission from the  growth-oriented government to establish themselves as  corporations enjoying limited liability. That is, a stockholder  could lose only his or her original investment in  the bank’s common stock and could not be assessed for  any additional losses. Publicizing the risk-reducing advantage  of limited liability, these Belgian banks were able  to attract many shareholders, large and small. They mobilized  impressive resources for investment in big companies,  became industrial banks, and successfully promoted  industrial development. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Similar corporate banks became important in France  and Germany in the 1850s and 1860s. Usually working  in collaboration with governments, they established and  developed many railroads and many companies working  in heavy industry, which were increasingly organized as  limited liability corporations. The most famous such bank  was the Crédit Mobilier of Paris, founded by Isaac and  Emile Pereire, two young Jewish journalists from Bordeaux.  The Crédit Mobilier advertised extensively. It used  the savings of thousands of small investors as well as the resources  of big ones. The activities of the bank were far- reaching; it built railroads all over France and Europe. As  Emile Pereire had said in 1835, “It is not enough to outline  gigantic programs on paper. I must write my ideas on  the earth. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The combined efforts of skilled workers, entrepreneurs,  governments, and industrial banks meshed successfully  between 1850 and the financial crash of 1873. This was a  period of unprecedentedly rapid economic growth on the  continent. In Belgium, Germany, and France, key indicators  of modern industrial development—such as railway  mileage, iron and coal production, and steam-engine  capacity—increased at average annual rates of 5 to 10 percent.  As a result, rail networks were completed in western  and much of central Europe, and the leading continental  countries mastered the industrial technologies that had first  been developed in Great Britain. In the early 1870s, Britain  was still Europe’s most industrial nation, but a select hand"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" ful of countries were closing the gap that had been opened  up by the Industrial Revolution. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Relations Between  Capital and Labor "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Industrial development brought new social relations and  intensified long-standing problems between capital and  labor in both urban workshops and cottage industry (see  pages 628–631). A new group of factory owners and industrial  capitalists arose. These men and women and  their families strengthened the wealth and size of the  middle class, which had previously been made up mainly  of merchants and professional people. The nineteenth  century became the golden age of the middle class. Modern  industry also created a much larger group, the factory  workers. For the first time, large numbers of men,  women, and children came together under one roof to  work with complicated machinery for a single owner or a  few partners in large companies. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The growth of new occupational groups in industry  stimulated new thinking about social relations. Often  combined with reflections on the French Revolution,  this thinking led to the development of a new overarching  interpretation—a new paradigm—regarding social  relationships (see Chapter 23). Briefly, this paradigm argued,  with considerable success, that individuals were  members of economically determined classes, which had  conflicting interests. Accordingly, the comfortable, well- educated “public of the eighteenth century came increasingly  to see itself as the backbone of the middle class  (or the middle classes), and the “people gradually transformed  themselves into the modern working class (or  working classes). And if the new class interpretation was  more of a deceptive simplification than a fundamental  truth for some critics, it appealed to many because it  seemed to explain what was happening. Therefore, conflicting  classes existed, in part, because many individuals  came to believe they existed and developed an appropriate  sense of class feeling—what Marxists call class- consciousness.

It became  considerably harder for a gifted but poor young mechanic  to start a small enterprise and end up as a wealthy manufacturer.  Formal education (for sons and males) became  more important as a means of success and advancement,  and formal education at the advanced level was expensive.  In Britain by 1830 and in France and Germany by 1860,  leading industrialists were more likely to have inherited  their well-established enterprises, and they were financially  much more secure than their struggling fathers and  mothers had been. They also had a greater sense of class- consciousness, fully aware that ongoing industrial development  had widened the gap between themselves and  their workers. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The wives and daughters of successful businessmen  also found fewer opportunities for active participation in  Europe’s increasingly complex business world. Rather  than contributing as vital partners in a family-owned enterprise,  as so many middle-class women such as Elizabeth  Strutt had done (see the feature “Individuals in  Society: The Strutt Family), these women were increasingly  valued for their ladylike gentility. By 1850 some influential  women writers and most businessmen assumed  that middle-class wives and daughters should steer clear  of undignified work in offices and factories. Rather, a  middle-class lady should protect and enhance her femininity.  She should concentrate on her proper role as wife  and mother, preferably in an elegant residential area far  removed from ruthless commerce and the volatile working  class. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The New Factory Workers "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The social consequences of the Industrial Revolution  have long been hotly debated. The condition of British  workers during the transformation has always generated  the most controversy among historians because Britain  was the first country to industrialize and because the social  consequences seemed harshest there. Before 1850  other countries had not proceeded very far with industrialization,  and almost everyone agrees that the economic  conditions of European workers improved after 1850.  Thus the experience of British workers to about 1850 deserves  special attention. (Industrial growth also promoted  rapid urbanization, with its own awesome problems, as  will be shown in Chapter 24.) "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" From the beginning, the Industrial Revolution in Britain  had its critics. Among the first were the romantic poets.  William Blake (1757–1827) called the early factories “satanic  mills and protested against the hard life of the Lon"}

Doctors and  reformers wrote eloquently of problems in the factories and  new towns, while Malthus and Ricardo concluded that  workers would earn only enough to stay alive. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Primary Source: Yorkshire Luddites Threaten the  Owner of a Mechanized Factory "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This pessimistic view was accepted and reinforced by  Friedrich Engels (1820–1895), the future revolutionary  and colleague of Karl Marx. After studying conditions in  northern England, this young middle-class German published  in 1844 The Condition of the Working Class in  England, a blistering indictment of the middle classes.  “At the bar of world opinion, he wrote, “I charge the  English middle classes with mass murder, wholesale robbery,  and all the other crimes in the calendar. The new  poverty of industrial workers was worse than the old  poverty of cottage workers and agricultural laborers, according  to Engels. The culprit was industrial capitalism,  with its relentless competition and constant technical  change. Engels’s extremely influential charge of middle- class exploitation and increasing worker poverty was embellished  by Marx and later socialists. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Meanwhile, other observers believed that conditions  were improving for the working people. Andrew Ure  wrote in 1835 in his study of the cotton industry that  conditions in most factories were not harsh and were  even quite good. Edwin Chadwick, a great and conscientious  government official well acquainted with the problems  of the working population, concluded that the  “whole mass of the laboring community was increasingly  able “to buy more of the necessities and minor luxuries  of life.6 Nevertheless, if all the contemporary  assessments had been counted up, those who thought  conditions were getting worse for working people would  probably have been the majority.

The son of a  farmer, Jedediah fell in love with Elizabeth when he  was apprenticed away from home as a wheelwright  and lodged with her parents. Both young people grew  up in the close-knit dissenting Protestant community,  which did not accept the doctrines of the state-sponsored  Church of England, and the well-educated Elizabeth  worked in a local school for dissenters and then for a  dissenter minister in London. Indecisive and self- absorbed, Jedediah inherited in 1754 a small stock of  animals from an uncle and finally married Elizabeth the  following year. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Aided by Elizabeth, who was “obviously a very  capable woman and who supplied some of the drive  her husband had previously lacked, Jedediah embarked  on a new career.* He invented a machine to make  handsome, neat-fitting ribbed silk stockings, which had  previously been made by hand.

Elizabeth’s letters reveal  a detailed knowledge of ribbed stockings and the prices  and quality of different kinds of thread.

{"prompt":"","completion":" with industrialization. But the most recent studies also  confirm the view that the early years of the Industrial  Revolution were hard ones for British workers. There  was little or no increase in the purchasing power of the  average British worker from about 1780 to about 1820.  The years from 1792 to 1815, a period of almost constant  warfare with France, were particularly difficult.  Food prices rose faster than wages, and the living conditions  of the laboring poor declined. Only after 1820, and  especially after 1840, did real wages rise substantially, so  that the average worker earned and consumed roughly  50 percent more in real terms in 1850 than in 1770.7 In  short, there was considerable economic improvement for  workers throughout Great Britain by 1850, but that improvement  was hard won and slow in coming. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This important conclusion must be qualified, however.  First, the hours in the average workweek increased, as some  economic historians now believe it had been increasing in  parts of northern Europe since the seventeenth century.  Thus, to a large extent, workers earned more simply because  they worked more. Indeed, significant recent research  shows that in England nonagricultural workers  labored about 250 days per year in 1760 as opposed  to 300 days per year in 1830, while the normal workday  remained an exhausting eleven hours throughout the  entire period. In 1760 nonagricultural workers still observed  many religious and public holidays by not working,  and Monday was popularly known as “Saint Monday  because so many workers took the day off. These days  of leisure and relaxation declined rapidly after 1760,  and by 1830 nonagricultural workers had joined landless  agricultural laborers in toiling six rather than five days  a week.8 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Second, the wartime decline in the average worker’s  standard of living was very important. The difficult war  years were formative years for the new factory labor  force, and they colored the early experience of modern  industrial life in somber tones. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Another way to consider the workers’ standard of living  is to look at the goods that they purchased. Again the  evidence is somewhat contradictory. Speaking generally,  workers ate somewhat more food of higher nutritional  quality as the Industrial Revolution progressed, except  during wartime. Diets became more varied; people ate  more potatoes, dairy products, fruits, and vegetables.  Clothing improved, but housing for working people  probably deteriorated somewhat. In short, per capita use  of specific goods supports the position that the standard  of living of the working classes rose, at least moderately,  after the long wars with France. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Conditions of Work "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What about working conditions? Did workers eventually  earn more only at the cost of working longer and harder?  Were workers exploited harshly by the new factory  owners? "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The first factories were cotton mills, which began functioning  along rivers and streams in the 1770s. Cottage  workers, accustomed to the putting-out system, were reluctant  to work in the new factories even when they received  relatively good wages because factory work was  unappealing. In the factory, workers had to keep up with  the machine and follow its tempo. They had to show up  every day and work long, monotonous hours. Factory  workers had to adjust their daily lives to the shrill call of  the factory whistle. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Cottage workers were not used to that kind of life and  discipline. All members of the family worked hard and  long, but in spurts, setting their own pace. They could  interrupt their work when they wanted to. Women and  children could break up their long hours of spinning with  other tasks. On Saturday afternoon the head of the family  delivered the week’s work to the merchant manufacturer  and got paid. Saturday night was a time of  relaxation and drinking, especially for the men. Recovering  from his hangover on Tuesday, the weaver bent to his  task on Wednesday and then worked frantically to meet  his deadline on Saturday. Like some students today, he  might “pull an all-nighter on Thursday or Friday in order  to get his work in. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Also, early factories resembled English poorhouses,  where totally destitute people went to live at public expense.  Some poorhouses were industrial prisons, where  the inmates had to work in order to receive their food and  lodging. The similarity between large brick factories and  large stone poorhouses increased the cottage workers’  fear of factories and their hatred of factory discipline. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was cottage workers’ reluctance to work in factories  that prompted the early cotton mill owners to turn to  abandoned and pauper children for their labor. As we  have seen, these owners contracted with local officials to  employ large numbers of these children, who had no say  in the matter. Pauper children were often badly treated  and terribly overworked in the mills, as they were when  they were apprenticed as chimney sweeps, market girls,  shoemakers, and so forth. In the eighteenth century,  semiforced child labor seemed necessary and was socially  accepted. From our modern point of view, it was cruel  exploitation and a blot on the record of the new industrial  system. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" By 1790 the early pattern was rapidly changing. The  use of pauper apprentices was in decline, and in 1802 it  was forbidden by Parliament. Many more factories were  being built, mainly in urban areas, where they could use  steam power rather than waterpower and attract a workforce  more easily than in the countryside. The need for  workers was great. Indeed, people came from near and  far to work in the cities, both as factory workers and as laborers,  builders, and domestic servants. Yet as they took  these new jobs, working people did not simply give in  to a system of labor that had formerly repelled them.  Rather, they helped modify the system by carrying over  old, familiar working traditions. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For one thing, they often came to the mills and the  mines as family units. This was how they had worked on "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" farms and in the putting-out system. The mill or mine  owner bargained with the head of the family and paid  him or her for the work of the whole family. In the cotton  mills, children worked for their mothers or fathers,  collecting scraps and “piecing broken threads together.  In the mines, children sorted coal and worked the ventilation  equipment. Their mothers hauled coal in the  tunnels below the surface, while their fathers hewed with  pick and shovel at the face of the seam. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The preservation of the family as an economic unit  in the factories from the 1790s on made the new surroundings  more tolerable, both in Great Britain and in  other countries, during the early stages of industrialization.  Parents disciplined their children, making firm measures  socially acceptable, and directed their upbringing. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \f 738 738  CHAPTER 22 • THE REVOLUTION IN ENERGY AND INDUSTRY, CA 1780–1860 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The presence of the whole family meant that children  and adults worked the same long hours (twelve-hour  shifts were normal in cotton mills in 1800). In the early  years, some very young children were employed solely  to keep the family together. For example, Jedediah  Strutt (see page 735) believed children should be at  least ten years old to work in his mills, but he reluctantly  employed seven-year-olds to satisfy their parents.  Adult workers were not particularly interested in limiting  the minimum working age or hours of their children  as long as family members worked side by side. Only  when technical changes threatened to place control  and discipline in the hands of impersonal managers and  overseers did adult workers protest against inhuman conditions  in the name of their children. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Some enlightened employers and social reformers in  Parliament definitely felt otherwise. They argued that  more humane standards were necessary, and they used  widely circulated parliamentary reports to influence public  opinion. For example, Robert Owen (1771–1858), a  very successful manufacturer in Scotland, testified in  1816 before an investigating committee on the basis  of his experience. He stated that “very strong facts  demonstrated that employing children under ten years of  age as factory workers was “injurious to the children, and  not beneficial to the proprietors.9 Workers also provided  graphic testimony at such hearings as the reformers  pressed Parliament to pass corrective laws. They scored  some important successes. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Their most significant early accomplishment was the  Factory Act of 1833. It limited the factory workday for  children between nine and thirteen to eight hours and  that of adolescents between fourteen and eighteen to  twelve hours, although the act made no effort to regulate  the hours of work for children at home or in small businesses.  Children under nine were to be enrolled in the elementary  schools that factory owners were required to  establish. The employment of children declined rapidly.  Thus the Factory Act broke the pattern of whole families  working together in the factory because efficiency required  standardized shifts for all workers. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Ties of blood and kinship were important in other  ways in Great Britain in the formative years between  about 1790 and 1840. Many manufacturers and builders  hired workers through subcontractors. They paid the  subcontractors on the basis of what the subcontractors  and their crews produced—for smelting so many tons of  pig iron or moving so much dirt or gravel for a canal or  roadbed. Subcontractors in turn hired and fired their  own workers, many of whom were friends and relations.  The subcontractor might be as harsh as the greediest capitalist,  but the relationship between subcontractor and "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" work crew was close and personal. This kind of personal  relationship had traditionally existed in cottage industry  and in urban crafts, and it was more acceptable to many  workers than impersonal factory discipline. This system  also provided people with an easy way to find a job. Even  today, a friend or relative who is a supervisor is frequently  worth a host of formal application forms. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Ties of kinship were particularly important for newcomers,  who often traveled great distances to find work.  Many urban workers in Great Britain were from Ireland.  Forced out of rural Ireland by population growth and  deteriorating economic conditions from 1817 on, Irish  in search of jobs could not be choosy; they took what  they could get. As early as 1824, most of the workers in  the Glasgow cotton mills were Irish; in 1851 one-sixth of  the population of Liverpool was Irish. Like many other  immigrant groups held together by ethnic and religious  ties, the Irish worked together, formed their own neighborhoods,  and not only survived but also thrived. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Sexual Division of Labor "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The era of the Industrial Revolution witnessed major  changes in the sexual division of labor. In preindustrial  Europe most people generally worked in family units. By  tradition, certain jobs were defined by gender—women  and girls for milking and spinning, men and boys for  plowing and weaving—but many tasks might go to either  sex. Family employment carried over into early factories  and subcontracting, but it collapsed as child labor was restricted  and new attitudes emerged. A different sexual division  of labor gradually arose to take its place. The man  emerged as the family’s primary wage earner, while the  woman found only limited job opportunities. Generally  denied good jobs at good wages in the growing urban  economy, women were expected to concentrate on unpaid  housework, child care, and craftwork at home. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This new pattern of “separate spheres had several aspects.  First, all studies agree that married women from the  working classes were much less likely to work full-time for  wages outside the house after the first child arrived, although  they often earned small amounts doing putting- out handicrafts at home and taking in boarders. Second,  when married women did work for wages outside the  house, they usually came from the poorest families, where  the husbands were poorly paid, sick, unemployed, or  missing. Third, these poor married (or widowed) women  were joined by legions of young unmarried women, who  worked full-time but only in certain jobs. Fourth, all  women were generally confined to low-paying, dead-end  jobs. Virtually no occupation open to women paid a wage  sufficient for a person to live independently. Men pre"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \f dominated in the better-paying, more promising employments.  Evolving gradually, but largely in place by 1850,  the new sexual division of labor in Britain constituted a  major development in the history of women and of the  family. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" If the reorganization of paid work along gender lines is  widely recognized, there is no agreement on its causes.  One school of scholars sees little connection with industrialization  and finds the answer in the deeply ingrained  sexist attitudes of a “patriarchal tradition, which predated  the economic transformation. These scholars stress  the role of male-dominated craft unions in denying  working women access to good jobs and relegating them  to unpaid housework. Other scholars, stressing that the  gender roles of women and men can vary enormously  with time and culture, look more to a combination of  economic and biological factors in order to explain the  emergence of a sex-segregated division of labor. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Three ideas stand out in this more recent interpretation.  First, the new and unfamiliar discipline of the clock  and the machine was especially hard on married women  of the laboring classes. Above all, relentless factory discipline  conflicted with child care in a way that labor on the  farm or in the cottage had not. A woman operating earsplitting  spinning machinery could mind a child of seven  or eight working beside her (until such work was outlawed),  but she could no longer pace herself through  pregnancy or breast-feed her baby on the job. Thus a  working-class woman had strong incentives to concentrate  on child care within her home if her family could afford  it. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Second, running a household in conditions of primitive  urban poverty was an extremely demanding job in its  own right. There were no supermarkets or public transportation.  Everything had to be done on foot. Shopping  and feeding the family constituted a never-ending challenge.  The woman marched from one tiny shop to another,  dragging her tired children (for who was to watch  them?) and struggling valiantly with heavy sacks and  tricky shopkeepers. Yet another brutal job outside the  house—a “second shift—had limited appeal for the average  married woman. Thus women might well have accepted  the emerging division of labor as the best available  strategy for family survival in the industrializing society.10 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Third, why were the women who did work for wages  outside the home segregated and confined to certain  “women’s jobs? No doubt the desire of males to monopolize  the best opportunities and hold women down  provides part of the answer. Yet as some feminist scholars  have argued, sex-segregated employment was also a collective  response to the new industrial system. Previously,  at least in theory, young people worked under a watchful "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Relations Between Capital and Labor • "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 739  parental eye. The growth of factories and mines brought  unheard-of opportunities for girls and boys to mix on the  job, free of familial supervision. Continuing to mix after  work, they were “more likely to form liaisons, initiate  courtships, and respond to advances.11 Such intimacy  also led to more unplanned pregnancies and fueled the illegitimacy  explosion that had begun in the late eighteenth  century and that gathered force until at least 1850  (see pages 656–657). Thus segregation of jobs by gender  was partly an effort by older people to help control the  sexuality of working-class youths. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Investigations into the British coal industry before  1842 provide a graphic example of this concern. (See the  feature “Listening to the Past: The Testimony of Young  Mine Workers on pages 744–745.) The middle-class  men leading the inquiry, who expected their daughters  and wives to pursue ladylike activities, often failed to appreciate  the physical effort of the girls and women who  dragged with belt and chain the unwheeled carts of coal  along narrow underground passages. But they professed  horror at the sight of girls and women working without  shirts, which was a common practice because of the heat,  and they quickly assumed the prevalence of licentious sex  with the male miners, who also wore very little clothing.  In fact, most girls and married women worked for related  males in a family unit that provided considerable protection  and restraint. Yet many witnesses from the working  class also believed that “blackguardism and debauchery  were common and that “they are best out of the pits, the  lasses. Some miners stressed particularly the danger of  sexual aggression for girls working past puberty. As one  explained: “I consider it a scandal for girls to work in the  pits. Till they are 12 or 14 they may work very well but after  that it’s an abomination. ...The work of the pit does  not hurt them, it is the effect on their morals that I complain  of.12 The Mines Act of 1842 prohibited underground  work for all women as well as for boys under ten. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Some women who had to support themselves protested  against being excluded from coal mining, which paid  higher wages than most other jobs open to working-class  women. But provided they were part of families that  could manage economically, the girls and the women who  had worked underground were generally pleased with the  law. In explaining her satisfaction in 1844, one mother of  four provided a real insight into why many women accepted  the emerging sexual division of labor: "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" While working in the pit I was worth to my [miner] husband  seven shillings a week, out of which we had to pay 21"}

{"prompt":"","completion":" one shilling a week for washing; besides, there was mending  to pay for, and other things. The house was not guided. The  other children broke things; they did not go to school when  they were sent; they would be playing about, and get ill-used  by other children, and their clothes torn. Then when I came  home in the evening, everything was to do after the day’s labor,  and I was so tired I had no heart for it; no fire lit, nothing  cooked, no water fetched, the house dirty, and nothing  comfortable for my husband. It is all far better now, and I  wouldn’t go down again.13 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Early Labor Movement in Britain "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Many kinds of employment changed slowly during and  after the Industrial Revolution in Great Britain. In 1850  more British people still worked on farms than in any  other occupation. The second-largest occupation was  domestic service, with more than one million household  servants, 90 percent of whom were women. Thus many  old, familiar jobs outside industry lived on and provided  alternatives for individual workers. This helped ease the  transition to industrial civilization. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Within industry itself, the pattern of artisans working  with hand tools in small shops remained unchanged in  many trades, even as some others were revolutionized by  technological change. For example, as in the case of cotton  and coal, the British iron industry was completely  dominated by large-scale capitalist firms by 1850. Many  large ironworks had more than one thousand people on  their payrolls. Yet the firms that fashioned iron into small  metal goods, such as tools, tableware, and toys, employed  on average fewer than ten wage workers, who  used time-honored handicraft skills. Only gradually after  1850 did some owners find ways to reorganize some  handicraft industries with new machines and new patterns  of work. The survival of small workshops gave  many workers an alternative to factory employment. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Working-class solidarity and class-consciousness developed  in small workshops as well as in large factories. In  the northern factory districts, where thousands of “hired  hands looked across at a tiny minority of managers and  owners, anticapitalist sentiments were frequent by the  1820s. Commenting in 1825 on a strike in the woolen center  of Bradford and the support it had gathered from other  regions, one paper claimed with pride that “it is all the  workers of England against a few masters of Bradford.14  Modern technology had created a few versus a many. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The transformation of some traditional trades by organizational  changes, rather than technological innovations,  could also create ill will and class feeling. The liberal concept  of economic freedom gathered strength in the late "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. As in France  during the French Revolution, the British government attacked  monopolies, guilds, and workers combinations in  the name of individual liberty. In 1799 Parliament passed  the Combination Acts, which outlawed unions and strikes.  In 1813 and 1814, Parliament repealed the old and often  disregarded law of 1563 regulating the wages of artisans  and the conditions of apprenticeship. As a result of these  and other measures, certain skilled artisan workers, such as  bootmakers and high-quality tailors, found aggressive capitalists  ignoring traditional work rules and flooding their  trades with unorganized women workers and children to  beat down wages. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" \f The liberal capitalist attack on artisan guilds and work  rules was bitterly resented by many craftworkers, who  subsequently played an important part in Great Britain  and in other countries in gradually building a modern  labor movement to improve working conditions and to  serve worker needs. The Combination Acts were widely  disregarded by workers. Printers, papermakers, carpenters,  tailors, and other such craftsmen continued to take  collective action, and societies of skilled factory workers  also organized unions. Unions sought to control the  number of skilled workers, limit apprenticeship to members’  own children, and bargain with owners over wages.  They were not afraid to strike; there was, for example, a  general strike of adult cotton spinners in Manchester in  1810. In the face of widespread union activity, Parliament  repealed the Combination Acts in 1824, and unions were  tolerated, though not fully accepted, after 1825. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The next stage in the development of the British trade- union movement was the attempt to create a single large  national union. This effort was led not so much by working  people as by social reformers such as Robert Owen.  Owen, a self-made cotton manufacturer (see page 738),  had pioneered in industrial relations by combining firm  discipline with concern for the health, safety, and hours  of his workers. After 1815 he experimented with cooper-"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 741  ative and socialist communities, including one at New  Harmony, Indiana. Then in 1834 Owen organized one  of the largest and most visionary of the early national  unions, the Grand National Consolidated Trades Union.  When this and other grandiose schemes collapsed, the  British labor movement moved once again after 1851 in  the direction of craft unions. The most famous of these  “new model unions was the Amalgamated Society of  Engineers, which represented skilled machinists. These  unions won real benefits for members by fairly conservative  means and thus became an accepted part of the industrial  scene. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" British workers also engaged in direct political activity  in defense of their own interests. After the collapse of  Owen’s national trade union, many working people went  into the Chartist movement, which sought political  democracy. The key Chartist demand—that all men be  given the right to vote—became the great hope of millions  of aroused people. Workers were also active in campaigns  to limit the workday in factories to ten hours and  to permit duty-free importation of wheat into Great  Britain to secure cheap bread. Thus working people developed  a sense of their own identity and played an active  role in shaping the new industrial system. They were neither  helpless victims nor passive beneficiaries. "}

Until about 1815,  these economic and political revolutions were separate, involving differ- ent countries and activities and proceeding at very different paces. After  peace returned in 1815, the situation changed. Economic and political  changes tended to fuse, reinforcing each other and bringing about what  chapterc h a p t e r p r e v i e w  The Peace Settlement  • How did the victorious allies fashion  a general peace settlement, and how  did Metternich uphold a conservative  European order?

{"prompt":"","completion":" • Why in 1848 did revolution triumph  briefly throughout most of Europe, and  why did it fail almost completely?  In Europe in the nineteenth century, as in Asia and Africa in more recent  times, the interrelated economic and political transformation was  built on complicated histories, strong traditions, and highly diverse cultures.  Radical change was eventually a constant, but the particular results  varied enormously. In central and eastern Europe especially, the traditional  elites—the monarchs, noble landowners, and bureaucrats—proved  capable of defending their privileges and eventually using nationalism as  a way to respond to the dual revolution and to serve their interests, as we  shall see in Chapter 25. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The dual revolution also posed a tremendous intellectual challenge.  The meanings of the economic, political, and social changes that were  occurring, as well as the ways they would be shaped by human action,  were anything but clear. These changes fascinated observers and stimulated  the growth of new ideas and powerful ideologies. The most important  of these ideological forces were revitalized conservatism and three  ideologies of change—liberalism, nationalism, and socialism. All played  critical roles in the political and social battles of the era and the great  popular upheaval that eventually swept across Europe in the revolutions  of 1848. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" historian Eric Hobsbawm has incisively called the dual revolution. For  instance, the growth of the industrial middle class encouraged the drive  for representative government, and the demands of the French sans- culottes in 1793 and 1794 inspired many socialist thinkers. Gathering  strength, the dual revolution rushed on to alter completely first Europe  and then the rest of the world. Much of world history in the past two  centuries can be seen as the progressive unfolding of the dual revolution. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Intervention and Repression "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There was also a domestic political side to the reestablishment  of peace. Within their own countries, the  leaders of the victorious states were much less flexible. In  1815 under Metternich’s leadership, Austria, Prussia,  and Russia embarked on a crusade against the ideas and  politics of the dual revolution. This crusade lasted until  1848. The first step was the Holy Alliance, formed by  Austria, Prussia, and Russia in September 1815. First  proposed by Russia’s Alexander I, the alliance soon became  a symbol of the repression of liberal and revolutionary  movements all over Europe. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In 1820 revolutionaries succeeded in forcing the monarchs  of Spain and the southern Italian kingdom of the  Two Sicilies to grant liberal constitutions against their  wills. Metternich was horrified: revolution was rising once  again. Calling a conference at Troppau in Austria under the  provisions of the Quadruple Alliance, he and Alexander I  proclaimed the principle of active intervention to maintain  all autocratic regimes whenever they were threatened. Austrian  forces then marched into Naples in 1821 and restored  Ferdinand I to the throne of the Two Sicilies, while French  armies likewise restored the Spanish regime. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the following years, Metternich continued to battle  against liberal political change. Sometimes he could do  little, as in the case of the new Latin American republics  that broke away from Spain. Nor could he undo the dynastic  changes of 1830 and 1831 in France and Belgium.  Nonetheless, until 1848 Metternich’s system proved  quite effective in central Europe, where his power was  the greatest. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Metternich’s policies dominated not only Austria and  the Italian peninsula but also the entire German Confederation,  which the peace settlement of Vienna had called  into being. The confederation was composed of thirty- eight independent German states, including Prussia and  Austria (see Map 23.1). These states met in complicated  assemblies dominated by Austria, with Prussia a willing  junior partner in the execution of repressive measures. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Metternich and Conservatism "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Metternich’s determined defense of the status quo made  him a villain in the eyes of most progressive, optimistic  historians of the nineteenth century. Yet rather than denounce  the man, we can try to understand him and the  general conservatism he represented. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Born into the middle ranks of the landed nobility of  the Rhineland, Prince Klemens von Metternich (1773–  1859) was an internationally oriented aristocrat who  made a brilliant diplomatic career in Austria. Austrian  foreign minister from 1809 to 1848, the cosmopolitan  Metternich always remained loyal to his class and jealously  defended its rights and privileges. Like most other  conservatives of his time, he did so with a clear conscience.  The nobility was one of Europe’s most ancient  institutions, and conservatives regarded tradition as the  basic source of human institutions. In their view, the  proper state and society remained those of pre-1789 Europe,  which rested on a judicious blend of monarchy, bureaucracy,  aristocracy, and respectful commoners. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Metternich firmly believed that liberalism, as embodied  in revolutionary America and France, had been responsible  for a generation of war with untold bloodshed  and suffering. Like many other conservatives then and  since, Metternich blamed liberal middle-class revolutionaries  for stirring up the lower classes, which he believed  desired nothing more than peace and quiet. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The threat of liberalism appeared doubly dangerous to  Metternich because it generally went with national aspirations.  Liberals believed that each people, each national  group, had a right to establish its own independent government  and seek to fulfill its own destiny. The idea of  national self-determination was repellent to Metternich.  It not only threatened the primacy of the aristocracy but  also threatened to destroy the Austrian Empire and revolutionize  central Europe. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" In the years following the peace settlement of 1815 intellectuals  and social observers sought to understand the  revolutionary changes that had occurred and were still  taking place. These efforts led to ideas that still motivate  the world. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Almost all of these basic ideas were radical. In one way  or another, they rejected the old, deeply felt conservatism,  with its stress on tradition, a hereditary monarchy,  a strong and privileged landowning aristocracy, and  an official church.

The  idea of liberty also meant specific individual freedoms:  freedom of the press, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly,  and freedom from arbitrary arrest. In Europe  only France with Louis XVIII’s Constitutional Charter  and Great Britain with its Parliament and historic rights  of English men and women had realized much of the liberal  program in 1815. Even in those countries, liberalism  had not fully succeeded. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Although liberalism retained its cutting edge, it was  seen by many as being a somewhat duller tool than it had  been. The reasons for this were that liberalism faced more  radical ideological competitors in the early nineteenth  century. Opponents of liberalism especially criticized its  economic principles, which called for unrestricted private  enterprise and no government interference in the economy.  This philosophy was popularly known as the doctrine  of laissez faire. (This form of liberalism is often  called “classical liberalism in the United States in order  to distinguish it sharply from modern American liberalism,  which usually favors more government programs to  meet social needs and to regulate the economy.) "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The idea of a free economy had first been persuasively  formulated by Scottish philosophy professor Adam  Smith, whose Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the  Wealth of Nations (1776) founded modern economics.  Smith was highly critical of eighteenth-century mercantilism  and its attempt to regulate trade and economic  activity. Far preferable were free competition and the  “invisible hand of the self-regulating market, which  would give all citizens a fair and equal opportunity to do  what they did best. Smith argued effectively that freely  competitive private enterprise would result in greater income  for everyone, not just the rich. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In early-nineteenth-century Britain this economic liberalism,  which promoted continued economic growth in  the Industrial Revolution, was embraced most enthusiastically  by business groups and became a doctrine associated  with business interests. Businessmen used the doctrine  to defend their right to do as they wished in their factories.  Labor unions were outlawed because they supposedly  restricted free competition and the individual’s  “right to work. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the early nineteenth century, liberal political ideals  also became more closely associated with narrow class interests.  Early nineteenth-century liberals favored repre"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" sentative government, but they generally wanted property  qualifications attached to the right to vote. In practice,  this meant limiting the vote to well-to-do aristocratic  landowners, substantial businessmen, and successful members  of the professions. Workers and peasants, as well as  the lower middle class of shopkeepers, clerks, and artisans,  did not own the necessary property and thus could  not vote. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As liberalism became increasingly identified with the  middle class after 1815, some intellectuals and foes of  conservatism felt that liberalism did not go nearly far  enough. Inspired by memories of the French Revolution  and the example of Jacksonian democracy in the young  American republic, they called for universal voting rights,  at least for males, and for democracy. These democrats  and republicans were more radical than the liberals, and  they were more willing than most liberals to endorse violent  upheaval to achieve goals. All of this meant that liberals  and radical, democratic republicans could join forces  against conservatives only up to a point. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Nationalism "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Nationalism was a second radical idea in the years after  1815—an idea destined to have an enormous influence  in the modern world. Nationalism had its immediate origins  in the French Revolution and the Napoleonic wars,  and there were already hints of its remarkable ability to  spread and develop. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Early advocates of the “national idea argued that each  people had its own genius and its own cultural unity. For  nationalists this cultural unity was basically self-evident,  manifesting itself especially in a common language, history,  and territory. In fact, in the early nineteenth century  such cultural unity was more a dream than a reality as far  as most nationalities were concerned. Within each ethnic  grouping only an elite spoke a standardized written language.  Local dialects abounded, and peasants from  nearby villages often failed to understand each other. As  for historical memory, it divided the inhabitants of the  different German or Italian states as much as it unified  them. Moreover, a variety of ethnic groups shared the  territory of most states. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Despite these basic realities, sooner or later European  nationalists usually sought to turn the cultural unity that  they perceived into a political reality. They sought to make  the territory of each people coincide with well-defined  boundaries in an independent nation-state. It was this  political goal that made nationalism so explosive in central  and eastern Europe after 1815, when there were either  too few states (Austria, Russia, and the Ottoman "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" In recent years scholars have been trying to understand  how the nationalist vision, often fitting so poorly with existing  conditions and promising so much upheaval, was  so successful in the long run. Certain interrelated ideas  stand out. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Of fundamental importance in the rise of nationalism  was the epoch-making development of complex industrial  and urban society, which required much better communication  between individuals and groups.1 These  communication needs promoted the use of a standardized  national language within many countries, creating at  least a superficial cultural unity as it eventually encompassed  the entire population through mass education. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 755  When a minority population was large and concentrated,  the nationalist campaign for a standardized language often  led to a push for a separate nation-state. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Many scholars also argue that nations are recent creations,  the product of the new, self-conscious nationalist  ideology. Thus nation-states emerged in the nineteenth  century as “imagined communities, communities seeking  to bind millions of strangers together around the abstract  concept of an all-embracing national identity. This meant  bringing citizens together with emotionally charged symbols  and ceremonies, such as independence holidays and  patriotic parades. On such fleeting occasions the imagined  nation of spiritual equals might celebrate its most hallowed  traditions, which were often recent inventions.2 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Historians also stress the dynamic, ever-changing character  of nationalism. Industrialism and mass education,  so important in the later nineteenth century, played only  a minor role before 1850. In those years the faith in nationhood  was fresh, idealistic, and progressive. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Between 1815 and 1850 most people who believed in  nationalism also believed in either liberalism or radical,  democratic republicanism. A common faith in the creativity  and nobility of the people was perhaps the single  most important reason for the linking of these two concepts.  Liberals and especially democrats saw the people as  the ultimate source of all government. Yet liberals and  nationalists agreed that the benefits of self-government  would be possible only if the people were united by common  traditions that transcended local interests and even  class differences. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Early nationalists usually believed that every nation,  like every citizen, had the right to exist in freedom and to  develop its character and spirit. They were confident that  a symphony of nations would promote the harmony and  ultimate unity of all peoples. The great Italian patriot  Guiseppe Mazzini (1805–1872) believed that “in laboring  according to the true principles of our country we are  laboring for Humanity. Thus the liberty of the individual  and the love of a free nation overlapped greatly in the  early nineteenth century. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Yet early nationalists also stressed the differences among  peoples. Even early nationalism developed a strong sense  of “we and “they. To this “we-they outlook, it was all  too easy for nationalists to add two highly volatile ingredients:  a sense of national mission and a sense of national superiority.  Even the French historian Jules Michelet, so alive  to the national aspirations of other peoples, could not help  speaking in 1846 of the “superiority of France; the principles  espoused in the French Revolution had made France  the “salvation of mankind. (See the feature “Individuals  in Society: Jules Michelet on page 769.) "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Russian and German nationalists had a very different  opinion of France. In the narratives they constructed, the  French often seemed oppressive, as the Russians did to  the Poles and as the Germans did to the Czechs. (See the  feature “Listening to the Past: Speaking for the Czech  Nation on pages 776–777.) Thus “they often emerged  as the enemy. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Early nationalism was ambiguous. Its main thrust was  liberal and democratic. But below the surface lurked  ideas of national superiority and national mission that  could lead to aggression and conflict. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" French Utopian Socialism "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Socialism, the new radical doctrine after 1815, began in  France, despite the fact that France lagged far behind  Great Britain in developing modern industry. Early  French socialist thinkers were acutely aware that the political  revolution in France, the rise of laissez faire, and  the emergence of modern industry in Britain were transforming  society. They were disturbed because they saw  these developments as fomenting selfish individualism  and splitting the community into isolated fragments.  There was, they believed, an urgent need for a further reorganization  of society to establish cooperation and a  new sense of community. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Early French socialists believed in economic planning.  Inspired by the emergency measures of 1793 and 1794  in France, they argued that the government should rationally  organize the economy and not depend on destructive  competition to do the job. Early socialists also  shared an intense desire to help the poor, and they  preached that the rich and the poor should be more  nearly equal economically. Finally, socialists believed that  private property should be strictly regulated by the government  or that it should be abolished and replaced by  state or community ownership. Planning, greater economic  equality, and state regulation of property—these  were the key ideas of early French socialism and of all socialism  since. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" One of the most influential early socialist thinkers was  a nobleman, Count Henri de Saint-Simon (1760–1825).  Saint-Simon optimistically proclaimed the tremendous  possibilities of industrial development: “The age of gold  is before us! The key to progress was proper social  organization. Such an arrangement of society required  the parasites—the court, the aristocracy, lawyers, and  churchmen—to give way, once and for all, to the  doers—the leading scientists, engineers, and industrialists.  The doers would carefully plan the economy and "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" guide it forward by undertaking vast public works projects  and establishing investment banks. Saint-Simon also  stressed in highly moralistic terms that every social institution  ought to have as its main goal improved conditions  for the poor. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" After 1830 the socialist critique of capitalism became  sharper. Charles Fourier (1772–1837), a lonely, saintly  man with a tenuous hold on reality, envisaged a socialist  utopia of mathematically precise, self-sufficient communities,  each made up of 1,620 people. Fourier was also an  early proponent of the total emancipation of women. Extremely  critical of middle-class family life, Fourier believed  that most marriages were only another kind of  prostitution. According to Fourier, young single women  were shamelessly “sold to their future husbands for  dowries and other financial considerations. Therefore,  Fourier called for the abolition of marriage, free unions  based only on love, and sexual freedom. Many middle- class men and women found these ideas, which were  shared and even practiced by some followers of Saint- Simon, shocking and immoral. The socialist program for  the liberation of women as well as workers appeared to  them as doubly dangerous and revolutionary. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Louis Blanc (1811–1882), a sharp-eyed, intelligent  journalist, focused on practical improvements. In his Organization  of Work (1839), he urged workers to agitate  for universal voting rights and to take control of the state  peacefully. Blanc believed that the state should set up  government-backed workshops and factories to guarantee  full employment. The right to work had to become as  sacred as any other right. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Finally, there was Pierre Joseph Proudhon (1809–  1865), a self-educated printer who wrote a pamphlet in  1840 titled What Is Property? His answer was that it was  nothing but theft. Property was profit that was stolen  from the worker, who was the source of all wealth. Unlike  most socialists, Proudhon feared the power of the  state and was often considered an anarchist. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Of great importance, the message of French utopian  socialists interacted with the experiences of French urban  workers. Workers cherished the memory of the radical  phase of the French Revolution, and they became violently  opposed to laissez-faire laws that denied workers  the right to organize. Developing a sense of class in the  process, workers favored collective action and government  intervention in economic life. Thus the aspirations  of workers and utopian theorists reinforced each other,  and a genuine socialist movement emerged in Paris in the  1830s and 1840s. To Karl Marx was left the task of establishing  firm foundations for modern socialism. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \f 757 757  The Birth of Marxian Socialism "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In 1848 the thirty-year-old Karl Marx (1818–1883) and  the twenty-eight-year-old Friedrich Engels (1820–1895)  published The Communist Manifesto, which became the  bible of socialism. The son of a Jewish lawyer who had  converted to Christianity, the atheistic young Marx had  studied philosophy at the University of Berlin before  turning to journalism and economics. He read widely in  French socialist thought, and like Fourier he looked forward  to the emancipation of women and the abolition of  the family. By the time Marx was twenty-five, he was developing  his own socialist ideas. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Early French socialists often appealed to the middle  class and the state to help the poor. Marx ridiculed such  appeals as naive. He argued that the interests of the middle  class and those of the industrial working class were inevitably  opposed to each other. Indeed, according to the  Manifesto, the “history of all previously existing society is  the history of class struggles. In Marx’s view, one class  had always exploited the other, and with the advent of  modern industry, society was split more clearly than ever  before: between the middle class (the bourgeoisie) and  the modern working class (the proletariat). "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Primary Source: “Working Men of All Countries, Unite! "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Just as the bourgeoisie had triumphed over the feudal  aristocracy, Marx predicted that the proletariat would  conquer the bourgeoisie in a violent revolution. While a  tiny minority owned the means of production and grew  richer, the ever-poorer proletariat was constantly growing  in size and in class-consciousness. In this process, the  proletariat was aided, according to Marx, by a portion of  the bourgeoisie who had gone over to the proletariat and  who (like Marx and Engels) “had raised themselves to  the level of comprehending theoretically the historical  moment. The critical moment, Marx thought, was very  near. “Let the ruling classes tremble at a Communist revolution.  The proletarians have nothing to lose but their  chains. They have a world to win. WORKING MEN OF  ALL COUNTRIES, UNITE! So ends The Communist  Manifesto. "}

Moreover, Marx incorporated Engels’s  charges of terrible oppression of the new class of  factory workers in England; thus Marx’s doctrines seemed  to be based on hard facts. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Marx’s theory of historical evolution was built on the  philosophy of the German Georg Hegel (1770–1831).  Hegel believed that each age is characterized by a dominant  set of ideas, which produces opposing ideas and  eventually a new synthesis. The idea of being had been  dominant initially, for example, and it had produced its  antithesis, the idea of nonbeing. This idea in turn had "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" resulted in the synthesis of becoming. Thus history has  pattern and purpose. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Marx retained Hegel’s view of history as a dialectic  process of change but made economic relationships between  classes the driving force. This dialectic explained  the decline of agrarian feudalism and the rise of industrial  capitalism. Marx stressed repeatedly that the “bourgeoisie,  historically, has played a most revolutionary  part. . . . During its rule of scarcely one hundred years the  bourgeoisie has created more massive and more colossal  productive forces than have all preceding generations together.  Marx’s next idea, that it was now the bourgeoisie’s  turn to give way to the socialism of revolutionary  workers, appeared to many the irrefutable capstone of a  brilliant interpretation of humanity’s long development.  Thus Marx pulled together powerful ideas and insights to  create one of the great secular religions out of the intellectual  ferment of the early nineteenth century. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Romantic Movement "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Radical concepts of politics and society were accompanied  by comparable changes in literature and other arts  during the dual revolution. The early nineteenth century  marked the acme of the romantic movement, which profoundly  influenced the arts and enriched European culture  immeasurably. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The romantic movement was in part a revolt against  classicism and the Enlightenment. Classicism was essentially  a set of artistic rules and standards that went hand  in glove with the Enlightenment’s belief in rationality,  order, and restraint. The classicists believed that the ancient  Greeks and Romans had discovered eternally valid  aesthetic rules and that playwrights and painters should  continue to follow them. Classicists could enforce these  rules in the eighteenth century because they dominated  the courts and academies for which artists worked. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Forerunners of the romantic movement appeared from  about 1750 on. Of these, Rousseau (see page 607)—  the passionate advocate of feeling, freedom, and natural  goodness—was the most influential. Romanticism then  crystallized fully in the 1790s, primarily in England and  Germany. The French Revolution kindled the belief that  radical reconstruction was also possible in cultural and  artistic life (even though many early English and German  romantics became disillusioned with events in France and  turned from liberalism to conservatism in politics). Romanticism  gained strength until the 1840s. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" • What were the characteristics of the romantic movement,  and who were some of the great romantic artists?  Romanticism’s Tenets "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Romanticism was characterized by a belief in emotional  exuberance, unrestrained imagination, and spontaneity  in both art and personal life. In Germany early romantics  of the 1770s and 1780s called themselves the Sturm und  Drang (“Storm and Stress), and many romantic artists  of the early nineteenth century lived lives of tremendous  emotional intensity. Suicide, duels to the death, madness,  and strange illnesses were not uncommon among leading  romantics. Romantic artists typically led bohemian lives,  wearing their hair long and uncombed in preference to  powdered wigs and living in cold garrets rather than frequenting  stiff drawing rooms. They rejected materialism  and sought to escape to lofty spiritual heights through  their art. Great individualists, the romantics believed the  full development of one’s unique human potential to be  the supreme purpose in life. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Nowhere was the break with classicism more apparent  than in romanticism’s general conception of nature.  Classicism was not particularly interested in nature. In  the words of the eighteenth-century English author Samuel  Johnson, “A blade of grass is always a blade of grass;  men and women are my subjects of inquiry. Nature  was portrayed by classicists as beautiful and chaste, like  an eighteenth-century formal garden. The romantics,  in contrast, were enchanted by nature. For some it was  awesome and tempestuous, while others saw nature as a  source of spiritual inspiration. As the great English landscape  artist John Constable declared, “Nature is Spirit  visible. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Most romantics saw the growth of modern industry as  an ugly, brutal attack on their beloved nature and on  the human personality. They sought escape—in the unspoiled  Lake District of northern England, in exotic  North Africa, in an idealized Middle Ages. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Fascinated by color and diversity, the romantic imagination  turned toward history with a passion. Beautiful,  exciting, and important, history was the art of change  over time—the key to a universe that was now perceived  to be organic and dynamic, not mechanical and static as  the Enlightenment had believed. Historical studies promoted  the growth of national aspirations, fanning the  embers of memory and encouraging entire peoples to  seek in the past their special destinies. "}

Raised on his grandfather’s farm, Scott fell under  the spell of the old ballads and tales of the Scottish border.  He was also deeply influenced by German romanticism,  particularly by the immortal poet and dramatist  Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749–1832). Scott translated  Goethe’s famous Gotz von Berlichingen, a play  about a sixteenth-century knight who revolted against  centralized authority and championed individual freedom— at least in Goethe’s romantic drama. A natural  storyteller, Scott composed long narrative poems and a  series of historical novels. Scott excelled in re-creating  the spirit of bygone ages and great historical events, especially  those of Scotland. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Classicism remained strong in France under Napoleon  and inhibited the growth of romanticism there. In 1813  Germaine de Staël (1766–1817), a Franco-Swiss writer  living in exile, urged the French to throw away their  worn-out classical models. Her study On Germany  (1810) extolled the spontaneity and enthusiasm of German  writers and thinkers, and it had a powerful impact  on the post-1815 generation in France. Between 1820  and 1850, the romantic impulse broke through in the  poetry and prose of Lamartine, de Vigny, Hugo, Dumas,  and Sand. Of these, Victor Hugo (1802–1885) was the  greatest in both poetry and prose. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Son of a Napoleonic general, Hugo achieved an amazing  range of rhythm, language, and image in his lyric poetry.  His powerful novels exemplified the romantic  fascination with fantastic characters, exotic historical settings,  and human emotions. The hero of Hugo’s famous  Hunchback of Notre Dame (1831) is the great cathedral’s  deformed bell-ringer, a “human gargoyle overlooking  the teeming life of fifteenth-century Paris. Renouncing  his early conservatism, Hugo equated freedom in literature  with liberty in politics and society. Hugo’s political  evolution was thus exactly the opposite of Wordsworth’s,  in whom youthful radicalism gave way to middle-aged  caution. As the contrast between the two artists suggests,  romanticism was a cultural movement compatible with  many political beliefs. "}

Like  modern anthropologists, they turned their attention to  peasant life and transcribed the folk songs, tales, and  proverbs that the cosmopolitan Enlightenment had disdained.  The brothers Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm were  particularly successful at rescuing German fairy tales from  oblivion. In the Slavic lands, romantics played a decisive  role in converting spoken peasant languages into modern  written languages.

Both were fascinated by nature, but their  interpretations of it contrasted sharply, aptly symbolizing  the tremendous emotional range of the romantic movement.  Turner depicted nature’s power and terror; wild  storms and sinking ships were favorite subjects. Constable  painted gentle Wordsworthian landscapes in which  human beings were at one with their environment, the  comforting countryside of unspoiled rural England. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It was in music that romanticism realized most fully  and permanently its goals of free expression and emotional  intensity. Abandoning well-defined structures, the  great romantic composers used a wide range of forms to  create a thousand musical landscapes and evoke a host  of powerful emotions. Romantic composers also transformed  the small classical orchestra, tripling its size by  adding wind instruments, percussion, and more brass  and strings. The crashing chords evoking the surge of the  masses in Chopin’s Revolutionary Etude, and the bottomless  despair of the funeral march in Beethoven’s  Third Symphony—such were the modern orchestra’s  musical paintings that plumbed the depths of human  feeling. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This range and intensity gave music and musicians  much greater prestige than in the past. Music no longer  simply complemented a church service or helped a nobleman  digest his dinner. Music became a sublime end in  itself, most perfectly realizing the endless yearning of the  soul.

People swooned  for Franz Liszt (1811–1886), the greatest pianist of his  age, as they scream for rock stars today. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Though romanticism dominated music until late in the  nineteenth century, no composer ever surpassed its first  great master, Ludwig van Beethoven (1770–1827). Extending  and breaking open classical forms, Beethoven  used contrasting themes and tones to produce dramatic  conflict and inspiring resolutions. As one contemporary  admirer wrote, “Beethoven’s music sets in motion the  lever of fear, of awe, of horror, of suffering, and awakens  just that infinite longing which is the essence of Romanticism.

{"prompt":"","completion":" National, liberal revolution, frustrated in Italy and Spain  by conservative statesmen, succeeded first after 1815 in  Greece. Since the fifteenth century, the Greeks had been  living under the domination of the Ottoman Turks. In  spite of centuries of foreign rule, the Greeks had survived  as a people, united by their language and the Greek Orthodox  religion. It was perfectly natural that the general  growth of national aspirations and a desire for independence  would inspire some Greeks in the early nineteenth  century. This rising national movement led to the formation  of secret societies and then to revolt in 1821, led by  Alexander Ypsilanti, a Greek patriot and a general in the  Russian army. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Great Powers, particularly Metternich, were opposed  to all revolution, even revolution against the Islamic  Turks. They refused to back Ypsilanti and supported the  Ottoman Empire. Yet for many Europeans, the Greek  cause became a holy one. Educated Americans and Europeans  were in love with the culture of classical Greece;  Russians were stirred by the piety of their Orthodox  brethren. Writers and artists, moved by the romantic impulse,  responded enthusiastically to the Greek national  struggle. The famous English romantic poet Lord Byron  even joined the Greeks and died fighting “that Greece  may yet be free. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Liberal Reform in Great Britain "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Eighteenth-century British society had been both flexible  and remarkably stable. It was dominated by the landowning  aristocracy, but that class was neither closed nor  rigidly defined. Successful business and professional  people could buy land and become gentlefolk, while the  common people had more than the usual opportunities  of the preindustrial world. Basic civil rights for all were  balanced by a tradition of deference to one’s social superiors.  Parliament was manipulated by the king and was  thoroughly undemocratic. Only about 8 percent of the  population could vote for representatives to Parliament,  and by the 1780s there was growing interest in some  kind of political reform. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But the French Revolution threw the British aristocracy  into a panic for a generation, making it extremely  hostile to any attempts to change the status quo. The  Tory Party, completely controlled by the landed aristocracy,  was particularly fearful of radical movements at  home and abroad. After 1815 the aristocracy defended  its ruling position by repressing every kind of popular  protest. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The first step in this direction began with revision of  the Corn Laws in 1815. Corn Laws to regulate the foreign  grain trade had long existed, but they were not  needed during a generation of war with France because  the British had been unable to import cheap grain from  eastern Europe, leading to high prices and large profits  for the landed aristocracy. Peace meant that grain could  be imported again and that the price of wheat and bread  would go down, benefiting almost everyone except the  aristocracy. The aristocracy, however, rammed far-reaching  changes in the Corn Laws through Parliament. The new  regulation prohibited the importation of foreign grain  unless the price at home rose to improbable levels. Seldom  has a class legislated more selfishly for its own narrow  economic advantage or done more to promote a  class-based view of political action. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The change in the Corn Laws, coming as it did at a  time of widespread unemployment and postwar economic  distress, resulted in protests and demonstrations  by urban laborers, who were supported by radical intellectuals.  In 1817 the Tory government responded by  temporarily suspending the traditional rights of peaceable  assembly and habeas corpus. Two years later, Parliament  passed the infamous Six Acts, which, among other "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 763  things, placed controls on a heavily taxed press and practically  eliminated all mass meetings. These acts followed  an enormous but orderly protest, at Saint Peter’s Fields  in Manchester, that had been savagely broken up by  armed cavalry. Nicknamed the Battle of Peterloo, in  scornful reference to the British victory at Waterloo, this  incident demonstrated the government’s determination  to repress and stand fast. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Strengthened by ongoing industrial development, the  new manufacturing and commercial groups insisted on a  place for their new wealth alongside the landed wealth of  the aristocracy in the framework of political power and  social prestige. They called for many kinds of liberal reform:  reform of town government, organization of a new  police force, more rights for Catholics and dissenters,  and reform of the Poor Laws that provided aid to some  low-paid workers. In the 1820s, a less frightened Tory  government moved in the direction of better urban administration,  greater economic liberalism, civil equality  for Catholics, and limited imports of foreign grain. These  actions encouraged the middle classes to press on for  reform of Parliament so they could have a larger say in  government. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Whig Party, though led like the Tories by great  aristocrats, had by tradition been more responsive to  commercial and manufacturing interests. In 1830 a Whig  ministry introduced “an act to amend the representation  of the people of England and Wales. Defeated, then  passed by the House of Commons, this reform bill was  rejected by the House of Lords. But when in 1832 the  Whigs got the king to promise to create enough new  peers to pass the law, the House of Lords reluctantly gave  in rather than see its snug little club ruined by upstart  manufacturers and plutocrats. A mighty surge of popular  protest had helped the king and lords make up their  minds. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Reform Bill of 1832 had profound  significance. The House of Commons had emerged as  the all-important legislative body. The new industrial areas  of the country gained representation in the Commons,  and many old “rotten boroughs—electoral  districts that had very few voters and that the landed aristocracy  had bought and sold—were eliminated.

Partly inspired by the economic distress  of the working class in the 1830s and 1840s, the  Chartists’ core demand was universal male (but not female)  suffrage. They saw complete political democracy  and rule by the common people as the means to a good  and just society. Hundreds of thousands of people signed  gigantic petitions calling on Parliament to grant all men  the right to vote, first and most seriously in 1839, again  in 1842, and yet again in 1848. Parliament rejected all  three petitions. In the short run, the working poor failed  with their Chartist demands, but they learned a valuable  lesson in mass politics. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" While calling for universal male suffrage, many working- class people joined with middle-class manufacturers in  the Anti–Corn Law League, founded in Manchester in  1839. Mass participation made possible a popular crusade  led by fighting liberals, who argued that lower food  prices and more jobs in industry depended on repeal of  the Corn Laws. Much of the working class agreed. When  Ireland’s potato crop failed in 1845 and famine prices for  food seemed likely in England, Tory prime minister  Robert Peel joined with the Whigs and a minority of his  own party to repeal the Corn Laws in 1846 and allow  free imports of grain.

{"prompt":"","completion":" The people of Ireland did not benefit from the political  competition in Britain. The great mass of the population  (outside of the northern counties of Ulster, which were  partly Presbyterian) were Irish Catholics, who rented  their land from a tiny minority of Church of England  Protestants. These landlords were content to use their  power to grab as much as possible. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The result was that the condition of the Irish peasantry  around 1800 was abominable. The typical peasant lived  in a wretched cottage and could afford neither shoes nor  stockings. Hundreds of shocking accounts describe  hopeless poverty. Yet in spite of terrible conditions, population  growth sped onward. The 3 million of 1725  reached 4 million in 1780 and doubled to 8 million by  1840. Between 1780 and 1840, 1.75 million people left  Ireland for Britain and America. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The population grew so quickly for three reasons: extensive  cultivation of the potato, early marriage, and exploitation  of peasants by landlords. The cultivation of the  potato, introduced into Ireland (and all of Europe) in  the late sixteenth century, was originally a response to the "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" pressure of numbers. Once peasants began to cultivate  potatoes, many more people could exist. A single acre of  land spaded and planted with potatoes could feed an  Irish family of six for a year, whereas two to four acres of  grain and pasture were needed to feed the same number.  The potato also could thrive on boggy wastelands. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Needing only a big potato patch to survive, Irish men  and women married early. Setting up housekeeping was  easy, for a cabin of mud and stone could be slapped together  with the help of friends and relatives in a few days.  A mat for a bed, chairs and a table, and an iron pot to boil  potatoes were easily acquired. To be sure, the young couple  was embracing a life of extreme poverty. They would  literally live on potatoes—ten pounds a day for an average  male—moistened at best with a cup of milk. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Yet the decision to marry and have large families made  sense. Landlords leased land for short periods only. Peasants  had no incentive to make permanent improvements  because anything beyond what was needed for survival  would quickly be taken by higher rent. Rural poverty was  inescapable and better shared with a spouse, while a dutiful  son or a loving daughter was an old person’s best  hope of escaping destitution. "}

Widespread starvation and mass  fever epidemics followed. Yet the British government,  committed to rigid laissez-faire ideology, was slow to act.  When it did, its relief efforts were tragically inadequate.  Moreover, the government continued to collect taxes,  and landlords demanded their rents. Tenants who could  not pay were evicted and their homes destroyed. Famine  or no, Ireland remained the conquered jewel of foreign  landowners. "}

Alone among the  countries of Europe, Ireland experienced a declining  population in the nineteenth century, from about 8 million  in 1845 to 4.4 million in 1911. Ireland became a  land of continuous out-migration, late marriage, and  widespread celibacy. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Great Famine also intensified anti-British feeling  and promoted Irish nationalism, for the bitter memory  of starvation, exile, and British inaction was burned deeply  into the popular consciousness.

Immediately after  Napoleon’s abortive Hundred Days, the moderate, worldly  king refused to bow to the wishes of die-hard aristocrats  such as his brother Charles, who wished to sweep away  all the revolutionary changes and return to a bygone age  of royal absolutism and aristocratic pretension.

Only about 100,000 of the wealthiest males out of a total  population of 30 million had the right to vote for the  deputies who, with the king and his ministers, made the  laws of the nation. Nonetheless, the “notable people who  did vote came from very different backgrounds.

Increasingly blocked by the opposition of the  deputies, Charles’s government turned in 1830 to military  adventure in an effort to rally French nationalism and gain  popular support. A long-standing economic and diplomatic  dispute with Muslim Algeria, a vassal state of the Ottoman  Empire, provided the opportunity. "}

The immediate reaction, encouraged by journalists  and lawyers, was an insurrection in the capital by printers,  other artisans, and small traders. In “three glorious  days, the government collapsed.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Famous proponent of democratic nationalism and  generally recognized as France’s pre-eminent romantic  historian, Jules Michelet (1798–1874) was born and  educated in Paris, the only child in a loving family of  poor printers. Largely self-taught in the family print  shop in his early years, the awkward apprenticeturned- student entered the prestigious Charlemagne  College in 1813 and had to repeat his first year. Then  he sped forward, winning prizes and building a brilliant  academic career. Yet Michelet remained true to his  roots in the common people, and he drew from history  a vision of a generous France that would embrace all  its children and heal their social divisions. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The young Michelet was strongly influenced by the  still largely ignored Italian philosopher Giovanni Battista  Vico (1668–1744), who viewed history as the  development of societies and human institutions, as  opposed to the biographies of great men or the work of  divine providence. Translating and popularizing Vico’s  work and quickly writing three general histories,  Michelet was rewarded with a professorship in Paris.  He then launched an in-depth study of French society  in the Middle Ages. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Motivated by the Gothic revival and romantic  nationalism, Michelet was also inspired by his  appointment as historical director of the National  Archives after the revolution of 1830. This enabled  him to combine teaching and writing with intense  research in still largely unexplored documentary  collections and present what he believed to be the  first genuine history of his country and its people.  Many historians, though not Michelet himself, believe  that his history of France in the Middle Ages—  published between 1833 and 1844 and becoming the  first six volumes in his multivolume History of France  (1833–1867)—is his most solid, useful, and lasting  accomplishment. They single out his vast knowledge of  the sources, his uncanny evocation of times and places,  and his empathic and balanced understanding of different  views and individuals. His treatment of the national  revival under Joan of Arc in the fifteenth century is a  famous example of his early work. "}

Rejecting socialism as  an unrealistic fantasy,  Michelet pleaded instead  for national unity: “One  people! one country! one France! Never, never, I beg  you, must we become two nations! Without unity, we  perish!* He also called for universal secular education,  which would teach the revolution in 1789 and  anchor France in a culture of republican democracy.  Michelet’s book was widely read and discussed. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Sickened by the failure of the revolution of 1848  and refusing to swear allegiance to Louis Napoleon,  Michelet lost his government positions and turned  to full-time writing. He completed his seven-volume  history of the French Revolution, filled in the early  modern period history of France with another eleven  volumes, and wrote popular impressions of nature and  anticlerical polemics. Michelet’s later history is often  criticized for being overly emotional and biased against  the monarchy, the nobility, and the clergy while idealizing  popular forces and revolutionary upheaval.

This refusal  led to the proclamation of a provisional republic, headed  by a ten-man executive committee and certified by cries  of approval from the revolutionary crowd. "}

Revolutionary compassion and sympathy  for freedom were expressed in the freeing of all slaves  in French colonies, the abolition of the death penalty, and  the establishment of a ten-hour workday for Paris. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Yet there were profound differences within the revolutionary  coalition in Paris. On the one hand, there were  the moderate, liberal republicans of the middle class.  They viewed universal male suffrage as the ultimate concession  to be made to popular forces, and they strongly  opposed any further radical social measures. On the  other hand, there were radical republicans and hard- pressed artisans. Influenced by a generation of utopian  socialists, and appalled by the poverty and misery of the  urban poor, the radical republicans were committed to  some kind of socialism. So were many artisans, who  hated the unrestrained competition of cutthroat capitalism  and who advocated a combination of strong craft  unions and worker-owned businesses. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Worsening depression and rising unemployment  brought these conflicting goals to the fore in 1848.  Louis Blanc, who along with a worker named Albert  represented the republican socialists in the provisional  government, pressed for recognition of a socialist right  to work. Blanc asserted that permanent government- sponsored cooperative workshops should be established  for workers. Such workshops would be an alternative to  capitalist employment and a decisive step toward a new,  noncompetitive social order. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The moderate republicans wanted no such thing. They  were willing to provide only temporary relief. The resulting  compromise set up national workshops—soon to become  little more than a vast program of pick-and-shovel  public works—and established a special commission under  Blanc to “study the question. This satisfied no one.  The national workshops were, however, better than  nothing. An army of desperate poor from the French  provinces and even from foreign countries streamed into  Paris to sign up. As the economic crisis worsened, the  number enrolled in the workshops soared from 10,000  in March to 120,000 by June, and another 80,000 were  trying unsuccessfully to join. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" While the workshops in Paris grew, the French masses  went to the election polls in late April. Voting in most  cases for the first time, the people of France elected to the  new Constituent Assembly about five hundred moderate  republicans, three hundred monarchists, and one hundred  radicals who professed various brands of socialism.  One of the moderate republicans was the author of  Democracy in America, Alexis de Tocqueville (1805– "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" This socialist revolution was evoking a violent reaction  not only among the frightened middle and upper classes  but also among the bulk of the population—the peasants.  The French peasants owned land, and according to  Tocqueville, “private property had become with all those  who owned it a sort of bond of fraternity.4 Returning  from Normandy to take his seat in the new Constituent  Assembly, Tocqueville saw that a majority of the members  were firmly committed to the republic and strongly  opposed to the socialists and their artisan allies, and he  shared their sentiments. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This clash of ideologies—of liberal capitalism and socialism— became a clash of classes and arms after the elections.  The new government’s executive committee  dropped Blanc and thereafter included no representative  of the Parisian working class. Fearing that their socialist  hopes were about to be dashed, artisans and unskilled  workers invaded the Constituent Assembly on May 15  and tried to proclaim a new revolutionary state. But the  government was ready and used the middle-class National  Guard to squelch this uprising. As the workshops continued  to fill and grow more radical, the fearful but powerful  propertied classes in the Assembly took the offensive. On  June 22, the government dissolved the national workshops  in Paris, giving the workers the choice of joining  the army or going to workshops in the provinces. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The result was a spontaneous and violent uprising.  Frustrated in attempts to create a socialist society, masses  of desperate people were now losing even their life- sustaining relief. As a voice from the crowd cried out  when the famous astronomer François Arago counseled  patience, “Ah, Monsieur Arago, you have never been  hungry!5 Barricades sprang up in the narrow streets of  Paris, and a terrible class war began. Working people  fought with the courage of utter desperation, but the  government had the army and the support of peasant  France. After three terrible “June Days and the death or  injury of more than ten thousand people, the republican  army under General Louis Cavaignac stood triumphant  in a sea of working-class blood and hatred.

{"prompt":"","completion":" The Austrian Empire in 1848 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Throughout central Europe, the first news of the upheaval  in France evoked feverish excitement and eventually  revolution. Liberals demanded written constitutions,  representative government, and greater civil liberties  from authoritarian regimes. When governments hesitated,  popular revolts followed. Urban workers and students  served as the shock troops, but they were allied  with middle-class liberals and peasants. In the face of this  united front, monarchs collapsed and granted almost  everything. The popular revolutionary coalition, having  secured great and easy victories, then broke down as it  had in France. The traditional forces—the monarchy, the  aristocracy, the regular army—recovered their nerve, reasserted  their authority, and took back many, though not  all, of the concessions. Reaction was everywhere victorious. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The revolution in the Austrian Empire began in Hungary,  where nationalistic Hungarians demanded national  autonomy, full civil liberties, and universal suffrage.  When the monarchy in Vienna hesitated, Viennese students  and workers took to the streets, and peasant disorders  broke out in parts of the empire. The Habsburg  emperor Ferdinand I (r. 1835–1848) capitulated and  promised reforms and a liberal constitution. Metternich  fled in disguise toward London. The old absolutist order  seemed to be collapsing with unbelievable rapidity. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The coalition of revolutionaries was not stable, however.  The Austrian Empire was overwhelmingly agricultural,  and serfdom still existed. On March 20, as part of  its capitulation before upheaval, the monarchy abolished  serfdom, with its degrading forced labor and feudal services.  Feeling they had won a victory reminiscent of that  in France in 1789, newly free men and women of the  land then lost interest in the political and social questions  agitating the cities. Meanwhile, the coalition of urban  revolutionaries also broke down. When artisan workers  and the urban poor rose in arms and presented their own  demands for socialist workshops and universal voting  rights for men, the prosperous middle classes recoiled in  alarm. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The coalition of March was also weakened, and ultimately  destroyed, by conflicting national aspirations. In  March the Hungarian revolutionary leaders pushed  through an extremely liberal, almost democratic, constitution.  But the Hungarian revolutionaries also sought to "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" transform the mosaic of provinces and peoples that was  the kingdom of Hungary into a unified, centralized,  Hungarian nation. To the minority groups that formed  half of the population—the Croats, Serbs, and Romanians— such unification was completely unacceptable. Each  felt entitled to political autonomy and cultural independence.  The Habsburg monarchy in Vienna exploited the  fears of the minority groups, and they were soon locked in  armed combat with the new Hungarian government. In  a somewhat similar way, Czech nationalists based in Bohemia  and the city of Prague came into conflict with German  nationalists. (See the feature “Listening to the Past:  Speaking for the Czech Nation on pages 776–777.) Thus  conflicting national aspirations within the Austrian Empire  enabled the monarchy to play off one ethnic group  against the other. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Finally, the conservative aristocratic forces gathered  around Emperor Ferdinand I regained their nerve and  reasserted their great strength. The archduchess Sophia,  a conservative but intelligent and courageous Bavarian  princess married to the emperor’s brother, provided a  rallying point. Deeply ashamed of the emperor’s collapse  before a “mess of students, she insisted that Ferdinand,  who had no heir, abdicate in favor of her son, Francis  Joseph.6 Powerful nobles who held high positions in the  government, the army, and the church agreed completely.  They organized around Sophia in a secret conspiracy  to reverse and crush the revolution. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Their first breakthrough came when the army bombarded  Prague and savagely crushed a working-class revolt  there on June 17. Other Austrian officials and nobles  began to lead the minority nationalities of Hungary  against the revolutionary government proclaimed by the  Hungarian patriots. At the end of October, the well- equipped, predominately peasant troops of the regular  Austrian army attacked the student and working-class  radicals in Vienna and retook the city at the cost of more  than four thousand casualties. Thus the determination of  the Austrian aristocracy and the loyalty of its army were  the final ingredients in the triumph of reaction and the  defeat of revolution. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When Francis Joseph (r. 1848–1916) was crowned  emperor of Austria immediately after his eighteenth  birthday in December 1848, only Hungary had yet to be  brought under control. But another determined conservative,  Nicholas I of Russia (r. 1825–1855), obligingly  lent his iron hand. On June 6, 1849, 130,000 Russian  troops poured into Hungary and subdued the country  after bitter fighting. For a number of years, the Habsburgs  ruled Hungary as a conquered territory. "}

The provinces  were inhabited primarily by Germans but were ruled by  the king of Denmark, although Holstein was a member of  the German Confederation. When Frederick VII, the new  nationalistic king of Denmark, tried to integrate both  provinces into the rest of his state, the Germans in these  provinces revolted.

By early 1849, however, reaction had been  successful almost everywhere. Frederick William had reasserted  his royal authority, disbanded the Prussian Constituent  Assembly, and granted his subjects a limited,  essentially conservative constitution. Reasserting that he  ruled by divine right, Frederick William contemptuously  refused to accept the “crown from the gutter. Bogged  down by their preoccupation with nationalist issues, the  reluctant revolutionaries in Frankfurt had waited too  long and acted too timidly. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When Frederick William, who really wanted to be emperor  but only on his own authoritarian terms, tried to get  the small monarchs of Germany to elect him emperor,  Austria balked.

Attempts  to unite the Germans—first in a liberal national state  and then in a conservative Prussian empire—had failed  completely. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In 1814 the victorious allied powers sought to restore  peace and stability in Europe. Dealing moderately with  France and wisely settling their own differences, the allies  laid the foundations for beneficial international cooperation  throughout much of the nineteenth century. Led by  Metternich, the conservative powers also sought to prevent  the spread of subversive ideas and radical changes in  domestic politics. Yet European thought has seldom  been more powerfully creative than after 1815, and ideologies  of liberalism, nationalism, and socialism all developed  to challenge the existing order in this period of  early industrialization and rapid population growth.

The moderate, nationalistic middle classes  were unable to consolidate their initial victories in France  or elsewhere in Europe. Instead, they drew back when  artisans, factory workers, and radical socialists rose up to  present their own much more revolutionary demands.  This retreat facilitated the efforts of dedicated aristocrats  in central Europe to reassert their power. And it made  possible the crushing of Parisian workers by a coalition of  solid bourgeoisie and landowning peasantry in France.

Asserting the  reality of a Czech nation and warning of both Russian  and German expansionism, he proposed a “union of  equals in a radically transformed Austria.

It is because in an  unhappy blindness which has lasted for very long,  Austria has not recognized the real legal and  moral foundation of its existence and has denied  it: the fundamental rule that all the nationalities  united under its scepter should enjoy complete  equality of rights and respect. The right of nations  is truly a natural right; no nation on earth has the  right to demand that its neighbour should  sacrifice itself for its benefit, no nation obliged to  deny or sacrifice itself for the good of its  neighbour. Nature knows neither ruling nor  subservient nations. If the union which unites  several different nations is to be firm and lasting,  no nation must have cause to fear that by that  union it will lose any of the goods which it holds  most dear; on the contrary each must have the  certain hope that it will find in the central  authority defense and protection against possible  violations of equality by neighbours; then every  nation will do its best to strengthen that central  authority so that it can successfully provide the  aforesaid defense. I am convinced that even now it  is not too late for the Austrian empire to proclaim  openly and sincerely this fundamental rule of  justice, the sacred anchor for a ship in danger of  floundering and to carry it out energetically in  common and in every respect; but every moment  is precious; for God’s sake do not let us delay  another hour with this! . . .

After  1848 Western political development veered off in a novel and uncharted  direction, but the growth of towns and cities rushed forward with undiminished  force. Thus Western society was urban and industrial in 1900  as surely as it had been rural and agrarian in 1800.

As we  saw in Chapter 22, the early consequences of economic transformation  were mixed and far-reaching and by no means wholly negative. By 1850  at the latest, working conditions were improving and real wages were rising  for the mass of the population, and they continued to do so until  1914. Thus given the poverty and uncertainty of preindustrial life, some  historians maintain that the history of industrialization in the nineteenth  century is probably better written in terms of increasing opportunities  than in terms of greater hardships.

People  were packed together almost as tightly as possible within  the city limits. The typical city was a “walking city: for  all but the wealthiest classes, walking was the only available  form of transportation.  Infectious disease spread with deadly speed in cities,  and people were always more likely to die in the city than  in the countryside. In the larger towns, more people died  each year than were born, on average, and urban populations  were able to maintain their numbers only because  newcomers were continually arriving from rural areas.  Little could be done to improve these conditions, given  the pervasive poverty, absence of urban transportation,  lack of medical knowledge, and deadly overcrowding.  Clearly, deplorable urban conditions did not originate  with the Industrial Revolution. What the Industrial Revolution  did was to reveal those conditions more nakedly  than ever before. The steam engine freed industrialists  from dependence on the energy of fast-flowing streams  and rivers so that by 1800 there was every incentive to  build new factories in urban areas. Cities had better shipping  facilities than the countryside and thus better supplies  of coal and raw materials. There were also many  hands wanting work in the cities, for cities drew people  like a magnet. And it was a great advantage for a manufacturer  to have other factories nearby to supply the business’s  needs and buy its products. Therefore, as industry  grew, there was also a rapid expansion of already overcrowded  and unhealthy cities.  The challenge of the urban environment was felt first  and most acutely in Great Britain. The number of people  living in cities of 20,000 or more in England and Wales  jumped from 1.5 million in 1801 to 6.3 million in 1851  and reached 15.6 million in 1891. Such cities accounted  for 17 percent of the total English population in 1801,  35 percent as early as 1851, and fully 54 percent in 1891.  Other countries duplicated the English pattern as they  industrialized (see Map 24.1).

{"prompt":"","completion":" In the 1820s and 1830s, people in Britain and France  began to worry about the condition of their cities. In  those years, the populations of a number of British cities  were increasing by 40 to 70 percent each decade. With  urban areas expanding at such previously undreamed-of  rates, people’s fatalistic acceptance of overcrowded, unsanitary  urban living conditions began to give way to active  concern. Something urgently needed to be done. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" On one point everyone could agree: except on the  outskirts, each town or city was using every scrap of land  to the fullest extent. Parks and open areas were almost  nonexistent. Buildings were erected on the smallest possible  lots in order to pack the maximum number of  people into a given space. Narrow houses were built wall  to wall in long rows. These row houses had neither front  nor back yards, and only a narrow alley in back separated  one row from the next. Or buildings were built around  tiny courtyards completely enclosed on all four sides.  Many people lived in extremely small, often overcrowded  cellars or attics. “Six, eight, and even ten occupying one  room is anything but uncommon, wrote a doctor from  Aberdeen in Scotland for a government investigation  in 1842. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" These highly concentrated urban populations lived in  extremely unsanitary and unhealthy conditions. Open  drains and sewers flowed alongside or down the middle  of unpaved streets. Toilet facilities were primitive in the  extreme. In parts of Manchester, as many as two hundred  people shared a single outhouse. Such privies filled up  rapidly, and since they were infrequently emptied, sewage  often overflowed and seeped into cellar dwellings. Moreover,  some courtyards in poorer neighborhoods became  dunghills, collecting excrement that was sometimes sold  as fertilizer. By the 1840s there was among the better-off  classes a growing, shocking “realization that, to put it as  mildly as possible, millions of English men, women, and  children were living in shit.2 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Who or what was responsible for these awful conditions?  The crucial factors were the tremendous pressure of  more people and the total absence of public transportation.  People simply had to jam themselves together if they  were to be able to walk to shops and factories. Another  factor was that government in Great Britain, both local  and national, was slow to provide sanitary facilities and establish  adequate building codes. This slow pace was probably  attributable more to a need to explore and identify  what precisely should be done than to rigid middle-class  opposition to government action.

{"prompt":"","completion":" The public health movement won dedicated supporters  in the United States, France, and Germany from the 1840s  on. Governments accepted at least limited responsibility  for the health of all citizens, and their programs broke decisively  with the age-old fatalism of urban populations in  the face of shockingly high mortality. By the 1860s and  1870s, European cities were making real progress toward  adequate water supplies and sewerage systems, city dwellers  were beginning to reap the reward of better health, and  death rates began to decline (see Figure 24.1). "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Still, effective control of communicable disease required  a great leap forward in medical knowledge and  biological theory. Early reformers such as Chadwick were  seriously handicapped by the prevailing miasmatic theory  of disease—the belief that people contract disease when  they breathe the bad odors of decay and putrefying excrement.  Keen observation by doctors and public health officials  in the 1840s and 1850s pinpointed the role of bad  drinking water in the transmission of disease and suggested  that contagion was spread through filth and not  caused by it, thus weakening the miasmatic idea. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The breakthrough was the development of the germ  theory of disease by Louis Pasteur (1822–1895), a French  chemist who began studying fermentation in 1854 at the  request of brewers. Using his microscope to develop a simple  test that brewers could use to monitor the fermentation  process and avoid spoilage, Pasteur found that fermentation  depended on the growth of living organisms and that  the activity of these organisms could be suppressed by heating  the beverage—by pasteurization. The breathtaking  implication was that specific diseases were caused by specific  living organisms—germs—and that those organisms could  be controlled in people as well as in beer, wine, and milk. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" By 1870 the work of Pasteur and others had demonstrated  the general connection between germs and disease.  When, in the middle of the 1870s, German country  doctor Robert Koch and his coworkers developed pure  cultures of harmful bacteria and described their life cycles,  the dam broke. Over the next twenty years, researchers—  mainly Germans—identified the organisms responsible  for disease after disease. These discoveries led to the development  of a number of effective vaccines.

City dwellers benefited especially  from these developments. By 1910 a great silent  revolution had occurred: the death rates for people of all  ages in urban areas were generally no greater than those  for people in rural areas, and sometimes they were less. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \f Urban Planning and Public  Transportation  More effective urban planning was one of the keys to improving  the quality of urban life. Urban planning was in  decline by the early nineteenth century, but after 1850 its  practice was revived and extended. France took the lead  during the rule of Napoleon III (r. 1848–1870), who  sought to stand above class conflict and promote the welfare  of all his subjects through government action. He  believed that rebuilding much of Paris would provide  employment, improve living conditions, and testify to  the power and glory of his empire. In the baron Georges  Haussmann (1809–1884), an aggressive, impatient Alsatian  whom he placed in charge of Paris, Napoleon III  found an authoritarian planner capable of bulldozing  both buildings and opposition. In twenty years, Paris was  transformed (see Map 24.2).  The Paris of 1850 was a labyrinth of narrow, dark streets,  the results of desperate overcrowding.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Haussmann and his fellow planners proceeded on  many interrelated fronts. With a bold energy that often  shocked their contemporaries, they razed old buildings  in order to cut broad, straight, tree-lined boulevards  through the center of the city as well as in new quarters  on the outskirts (see Map 24.2). These boulevards, designed  in part to prevent the easy construction and defense  of barricades by revolutionary crowds, permitted  traffic to flow freely and afforded impressive vistas. Their  creation also demolished some of the worst slums. New  streets stimulated the construction of better housing, especially  for the middle classes. Small neighborhood parks  and open spaces were created throughout the city, and  two very large parks suitable for all kinds of holiday activities  were developed—one on the wealthy west side and  one on the poor east side of the city. The city also improved  its sewers, and a system of aqueducts more than  doubled the city’s supply of good fresh water. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Rebuilding Paris provided a new model for urban planning  and stimulated modern urbanism throughout Europe,  particularly after 1870. In city after city, public  authorities mounted a coordinated attack on many of the  interrelated problems of the urban environment. As in  Paris, improvements in public health through better water  supply and waste disposal often went hand in hand with  new boulevard construction. Cities such as Vienna and  Cologne followed the Parisian example of tearing down  old walled fortifications and replacing them with broad,  circular boulevards on which office buildings, town halls,  theaters, opera houses, and museums were erected. These  ring roads and the new boulevards that radiated out from  them toward the outskirts eased movement and encouraged  urban expansion (see Map 24.2). Zoning expropriation  laws, which allowed a majority of the owners of land  in a given quarter of the city to impose major street or  sanitation improvements on a reluctant minority, were an  important mechanism of the new urbanism. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The development of mass public transportation was  also of great importance in the improvement of urban  living conditions. In the 1870s, many European cities authorized  private companies to operate horse-drawn streetcars,  which had been developed in the United States, to  carry riders along the growing number of major thoroughfares.  Then in the 1890s, the real revolution occurred:  European countries adopted another American  transit innovation, the electric streetcar. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Electric streetcars were cheaper, faster, more dependable,  and more comfortable than their horse-drawn  counterparts. Service improved dramatically. Millions of  Europeans—workers, shoppers, schoolchildren—hopped  on board during the workweek. And on weekends and  holidays, streetcars carried millions on happy outings to  parks and countryside, racetracks and music halls. In 1886  the horse-drawn streetcars of Austria-Hungary, France,  Germany, and Great Britain were carrying about 900 million  riders. By 1910 electric streetcar systems in the four  countries were carrying 6.7 billion riders.5 Each man,  woman, and child was using public transportation four  times as often in 1910 as in 1886. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Good mass transit helped greatly in the struggle for  decent housing. The new boulevards and horse-drawn  streetcars had facilitated a middle-class move to better  housing in the 1860s and 1870s; after 1890 electric streetcars  gave people of modest means access to new, improved  housing. The still-crowded city was able to expand  and become less congested. In England in 1901, only  9 percent of the urban population was “overcrowded in  terms of the official definition of more than two persons  per room. On the continent, many city governments in  the early twentieth century were building electric streetcar  systems that provided transportation to new public  and private housing developments in outlying areas of  the city for the working classes.

{"prompt":"","completion":" At the top stood the upper middle class, composed  mainly of the most successful business families from banking,  industry, and large-scale commerce. As people in the  upper middle class gained in income and progressively  lost all traces of radicalism after the trauma of 1848, they  were almost irresistibly drawn toward the aristocratic  lifestyle. And although the genuine hereditary aristocracy  constituted only a tiny minority in every European country,  it retained imposing wealth, unrivaled social prestige,  and substantial political influence. This was especially true  in central and eastern Europe, where the monarch—the  highest-ranking noble of them all—continued to hold great  political power. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As the aristocracy had long divided the year between  palatial country estates and lavish townhouses during  “the season, so the upper middle class purchased country  places or built beach houses for weekend and summer  use.

Private coaches and carriages,  ever-expensive items in the city, were also signs of  rising social status. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Below the wealthy upper middle class were much  larger, much less wealthy, and increasingly diversified  middle-class groups. Here one found the moderately  successful industrialists and merchants as well as professionals  in law and medicine. This was the middle middle  class, solid and quite comfortable but lacking great wealth.  Below it were independent shopkeepers, small traders,  and tiny manufacturers—the lower middle class. Both of  these traditional elements of the middle class expanded  modestly in size with economic development. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Meanwhile, the traditional middle class was gaining two  particularly important additions. The expansion of industry  and technology created a growing demand for experts with  specialized knowledge. The most valuable of the specialties  became solid middle-class professions. Engineering, for  example, emerged from the world of skilled labor as a  full-fledged profession of great importance, considerable  prestige, and many branches. Architects, chemists, accountants,  and surveyors, to name only a few, first achieved professional  standing in this period. They established criteria  for advanced training and certification and banded together  in organizations to promote and defend their interests. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Management of large public and private institutions  also emerged as a kind of profession as governments provided  more services and as very large corporations such  as railroads came into being.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Middle-Class Culture "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In spite of growing occupational diversity and conflicting  interests, the middle classes were loosely united by a certain  style of life and culture. Food was the largest item in  the household budget, for middle-class people liked to eat  very well. The European middle classes consumed meat in  abundance, and a well-off family might spend 10 percent  of its substantial earnings on meat and fully 25 percent of  its income on food and drink. Spending on food was also  great because the dinner party was this class’s favored social  occasion. A wealthy family might give a lavish party for  eight to twelve almost every week, whereas more modest  households would settle for once a month. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The middle-class wife could cope with this endless  procession of meals, courses, and dishes because she had  both servants and money at her disposal. Indeed, the employment  of at least one enormously helpful full-time  maid to cook and clean was the best single sign that a  family had crossed the cultural divide separating the  working classes from what some contemporary observers  called the “servant-keeping classes. The greater a family’s  income, the greater the number of servants it employed.  Food and servants together absorbed about 50  percent of income at all levels of the middle class. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Well fed and well served, the middle classes were also  well housed by 1900. Many quite prosperous families  rented, rather than owned, their homes. Apartment living,  complete with tiny rooms for servants under the eaves of  the top floor, was commonplace, and wealthy investors and  speculative builders found good profits in middle-class  housing. By 1900 the middle classes were also quite clothes- conscious. The factory, the sewing machine, and the department  store had all helped reduce the cost and expand  the variety of clothing. Middle-class women were particularly  attentive to the fickle dictates of fashion. (See the "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Education was another growing expense, as middle- class parents tried to provide their children with ever  more crucial advanced education. The keystones of culture  and leisure were books, music, and travel. The long  realistic novel, the heroics of composers Wagner and  Verdi, the diligent striving of the dutiful daughter at the  piano, and the packaged tour to a foreign country were  all sources of middle-class pleasure. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Finally, the middle classes were loosely united by a  shared code of expected behavior and morality. This code  was strict and demanding. It laid great stress on hard work,  self-discipline, and personal achievement. Men and women  who fell into crime or poverty were generally assumed to  be responsible for their own circumstances. Traditional  Christian morality was reaffirmed by this code and was  preached tirelessly by middle-class people. Drunkenness  and gambling were denounced as vices; sexual purity and  fidelity were celebrated as virtues. In short, the middle- class person was supposed to know right from wrong and  was expected to act accordingly. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Working Classes "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" About four out of five people belonged to the working  classes at the turn of the century. Many members of the  working classes—that is, people whose livelihoods depended  on physical labor and who did not employ domestic  servants—were still small landowning peasants  and hired farm hands. This was especially true in eastern  Europe. In western and central Europe, however, the  typical worker had left the land. In Great Britain, less  than 8 percent of the people worked in agriculture, and  in rapidly industrializing Germany only 25 percent were  employed in agriculture and forestry. Even in less industrialized  France, less than 50 percent of the people depended  on the land in 1900. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The urban working classes were even less unified and  homogeneous than the middle classes. In the first place,  economic development and increased specialization expanded  the traditional range of working-class skills, earnings,  and experiences.

{"prompt":"","completion":" In the second place, skilled, semiskilled, and unskilled  workers developed widely divergent lifestyles and cultural  values, and their differences contributed to a keen sense  of social status and hierarchy within the working classes.  The result was great variety and limited class unity. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Highly skilled workers, who made up about 15 percent  of the working classes, became a real labor aristocracy.  These workers earned only about two-thirds of the income  of the bottom ranks of the servant-keeping classes,  but that was fully twice as much as the earnings of unskilled  workers. The most “aristocratic of the highly skilled  workers were construction bosses and factory foremen,  men who had risen from the ranks and were fiercely  proud of their achievement. The labor aristocracy also included  members of the traditional highly skilled handicraft  trades that had not been mechanized or placed in  factories, like cabinetmakers, jewelers, and printers. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This group as a whole was under constant long-term  pressure. Irregularly but inexorably, factory methods  were being extended to more crafts, and many skilled artisans  were being replaced by lower-paid semiskilled factory  workers. Traditional woodcarvers and watchmakers  virtually disappeared, for example, as the making of furniture  and timepieces now took place in the factory. At  the same time, the labor aristocracy was consistently  being enlarged by new kinds of skilled workers such as  shipbuilders and railway locomotive engineers. Thus the  labor elite remained in a state of flux as individuals and  whole crafts moved in and out of it. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" To maintain this precarious standing, the upper working  class adopted distinctive values and strait-laced, almost  puritanical behavior. Like the middle classes, the  labor aristocracy was strongly committed to the family  and to economic improvement. Families in the upper  working class saved money regularly, worried about their  children’s education, and valued good housing. Despite  these similarities, skilled workers viewed themselves not  as aspirants to the middle class but as the pacesetters and  natural leaders of all the working classes. Well aware of  the degradation not so far below them, they practiced  self-discipline and stern morality. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Below the labor aristocracy stood semiskilled and unskilled  urban workers. The enormous complexity of this  sector of the world of labor is not easily summarized. Workers  in the established crafts—carpenters, bricklayers, pipe  fitters—stood near the top of the semiskilled hierarchy, often  flirting with (or sliding back from) the labor elite. A  large number of the semiskilled were factory workers who  earned highly variable but relatively good wages and whose  relative importance in the labor force was increasing. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Below the semiskilled workers was a larger group of unskilled  workers that included day laborers such as longshoremen,  wagon-driving teamsters, teenagers, and every  kind of “helper. Many of these people had real skills and  performed valuable services, but they were unorganized  and divided, united only by the common fate of meager  earnings. The same lack of unity characterized street vendors  and market people—self-employed workers who  competed savagely with each other and with the established  shopkeepers of the lower middle class. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" One of the largest components of the unskilled group  was domestic servants, whose numbers grew steadily in the  nineteenth century. In advanced Great Britain, for example,  one out of every seven employed persons was a domestic  servant in 1911. The great majority were women; indeed,  one out of every three girls in Britain between the ages of  fifteen and twenty was a domestic servant. Throughout Europe  and America, a great many female domestics in the  cities were recent migrants from rural areas. As in earlier  times, domestic service was still hard work at low pay with  limited personal independence and the danger of sexual  exploitation. For the full-time general maid in a lowermiddle- class family, there was an unending routine of babysitting,  shopping, cooking, and cleaning. In the great  households, the girl was at the bottom of a rigid hierarchy  of status-conscious butlers and housekeepers. "}

A great decline in  “cruel sports, such as bullbaiting and cockfighting, had  occurred throughout Europe by the late nineteenth century.

In 1900 there  were more than fifty such halls and theaters in London  alone. Music hall audiences were thoroughly mixed, which  may account for the fact that drunkenness, sexual intercourse  and pregnancy before marriage, marital difficulties,  and problems with mothers-in-law were favorite themes  of broad jokes and bittersweet songs. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In more serious moments, religion and Christian  churches continued to provide working people with solace  and meaning. The eighteenth-century vitality of popular  religion in Catholic countries and the Protestant  rejuvenation exemplified by German Pietism and English  Methodism (see pages 672–673) carried over into the  nineteenth century. Indeed, many historians see the early  nineteenth century as an age of religious revival. Yet historians  also recognize that by the last two or three  decades of the nineteenth century, a considerable decline  in both church attendance and church donations was occurring  in most European countries. And it seems clear  that this decline was greater for the urban working classes  than for their rural counterparts or for the middle classes. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" What did the decline in working-class church attendance  really mean? Some have argued that it accurately  reflected a general decline in faith and religious belief.  Others disagree, noting correctly that most working- class families still baptized their children and considered  themselves Christians. Although more research is necessary,  it appears that the urban working classes in Europe  did become more secular and less religious in the late  nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. They rarely repudiated  the Christian religion, but it tended to play a diminishing  role in their daily lives. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Part of the reason for this change was that the construction  of churches failed to keep up with the rapid growth of  urban population, especially in new working-class neighborhoods.  Thus the vibrant, materialistic urban environment  undermined popular religious impulses, which were  poorly served in the cities. Equally important, however,  was the fact that throughout the nineteenth century both  Catholic and Protestant churches were normally seen as  they saw themselves—as conservative institutions defending  social order and custom. Therefore, as the European  working classes became more politically conscious, they  tended to see the established (or quasi-established) “territorial  church as defending what they wished to change  and as allied with their political opponents. Especially the  men of the urban working classes developed vaguely anti- church attitudes, even though they remained neutral or  positive toward religion. They tended to regard regular  church attendance as “not our kind of thing—not part of  urban working-class culture. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Changing Family • "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 797  The pattern was different in the United States. There,  most churches also preached social conservatism in the  nineteenth century. But because church and state had always  been separate and because there was always a host  of competing denominations and even different religions,  working people identified churches much less with  the political and social status quo. Instead, individual  churches in the United States were often closely identified  with an ethnic group rather than with a social class,  and churches thrived, in part, as a means of asserting ethnic  identity. This same process did occur in Europe if the  church or synagogue had never been linked to the state  and served as a focus for ethnic cohesion. Irish Catholic  churches in Protestant Britain and Jewish synagogues in  Russia were outstanding examples. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Changing Family "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Urban life wrought many fundamental changes in the family.  Although much is still unknown, it seems clear that in  the second half of the nineteenth century the family had  stabilized considerably after the disruption of the late eighteenth  and early nineteenth centuries. The home became  more important for both men and women. The role of  women and attitudes toward children underwent substantial  change, and adolescence emerged as a distinct stage of  life. These are but a few of the transformations that affected  all social classes in varying degrees. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" By 1850 the preindustrial pattern of lengthy courtship  and mercenary marriage was pretty well dead among the  working classes. In its place, the ideal of romantic love  had triumphed. Couples were ever more likely to come  from different, even distant, towns and to be more nearly  the same age, further indicating that romantic sentiment  was replacing tradition and financial considerations.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Economic considerations in marriage remained more  important to the middle classes than to the working classes  after 1850.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Middle-class boys were watched, too, but not as vigilantly.  By the time they reached late adolescence, they  had usually attained considerable sexual experience with  maids or prostitutes. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the early nineteenth century, sexual experimentation  before marriage also triumphed, as did illegitimacy.  There was an illegitimacy explosion between 1750 and  1850 (see page 656). By the 1840s, one birth in three  was occurring outside of wedlock in many large cities of  western, northern, and central Europe. In Vienna and  Stockholm, one out of every two births was illegitimate.  Although poverty and economic uncertainty undoubtedly  prevented many lovers from marrying, there were  also many among the poor and propertyless who saw little  wrong with having illegitimate offspring. Thus the  pattern of romantic ideals, premarital sexual activity, and  widespread illegitimacy was firmly established by mid- century among the urban working classes. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Some regions, especially those little touched by industrialization  and urbanization, did not experience an illegitimacy  explosion. Neither did certain churches and  religious communities that strictly prohibited premarital  sex. “The Catholic Church in Ireland and many southern  European regions, Calvinist communities in the Netherlands,  Moslems in the Balkans, and Jewish communities  throughout Europe seem to have been successful in enforcing  this norm.10 Although these religious groups  exercised strict external control, they succeeded in large  part because their young people internalized the values  they were taught and acted accordingly. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In western, northern, and central Europe, the rising  rate of illegitimacy was reversed in the second half of the  nineteenth century: more babies were born to married  mothers. Some observers have argued that this shift reflected  the growth of puritanism and a lessening of sexual  permissiveness among the unmarried. This explanation,  however, is unconvincing. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Thus unmarried young people were probably engaging  in just as much sexual activity as their parents and grandparents  who had created the illegitimacy explosion of  1750 to 1850. But in the later nineteenth century, pregnancy  for a young single woman led increasingly to marriage  and the establishment of a two-parent household.  This important development reflected the growing respectability  of the working classes as well as their gradual  economic improvement. Skipping out was less acceptable,  and marriage was less of an economic challenge. Thus the  urban working-class couple became more stable, and that  stability strengthened the family as an institution. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prostitution "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In Paris alone, 155,000 women were registered as prostitutes  between 1871 and 1903, and 750,000 others were  suspected of prostitution in the same years. Men of all  classes visited prostitutes, but the middle and upper classes  supplied much of the motivating cash. Thus, though many  middle-class men abided by the publicly professed code of  stern puritanical morality, others indulged their appetites  for prostitutes and sexual promiscuity. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" My Secret Life, the anonymous eleven-volume autobiography  of an English sexual adventurer from the servant- keeping classes, provides a remarkable picture of such a  man.

In almost every one of  his innumerable encounters all across Europe, this man  of wealth simply buys his pleasure.

Brutal  sexist behavior was part of life—a part the sternly moral  women (and men) of the upper working class detested and  tried to shield their daughters from. For many poor young  women, prostitution, like domestic service, was a stage of  life and not a permanent employment.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Kinship Ties "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Within working-class homes, ties to relatives after marriage—  kinship ties—were in general much stronger than many  social observers have recognized. Most newlyweds tried  to live near their parents, though not in the same house.  Indeed, for many married couples in later-nineteenthcentury  cities, ties to mothers and fathers, uncles and  aunts, were more important than ties to unrelated acquaintances. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" People turned to their families for help in coping with  sickness, unemployment, death, and old age. Although  governments were generally providing more welfare services  by 1900, the average couple and its children inevitably  faced crises. Funerals, for example, brought sudden  demands, requiring a large outlay for special clothes, carriages,  and burial services. Unexpected death or desertion  could leave the bereaved or abandoned, especially  widows and orphans, in need of financial aid or perhaps a  foster home. Relatives responded hastily to such cries,  knowing full well that their own time of need and repayment  would undoubtedly come. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Relatives were also valuable at less tragic moments. If a  couple was very poor, an aged relation often moved in to  cook and mind the children so that the wife could earn  badly needed income outside the home. Sunday dinners  were often shared, as were outgrown clothing and useful  information. Often the members of a large family group  all lived in the same neighborhood. "}

Only in a few occupations,  such as retail trade, did married couples live where  they worked and struggle together to make their mom- and-pop operations a success. Factory employment for  married women also declined as the early practice of hiring  entire families in the factory disappeared. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As economic conditions improved, most men expected  married women to work outside the home only in poor  families. One old English worker recalled that “the boy  wanted to get into a position that would enable him to  keep a wife and family, as it was considered a thoroughly  unsatisfactory state of affairs if the wife had to work to  help maintain the home.12 The ideal became a strict division  of labor by gender and rigidly constructed separate  spheres: the wife as mother and homemaker, the  husband as wage earner. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This rigid gender division of labor meant that married  women faced great injustice when they needed—or  wanted—to move into the man’s world of employment  outside the home. Husbands were unsympathetic or hostile.  Well-paying jobs were off-limits to women, and a  woman’s wage was almost always less than a man’s, even  for the same work. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Moreover, married women were subordinated to their  husbands by law and lacked many basic legal rights. In  England the situation in the early nineteenth century was  summed up in a famous line from jurist William Blackstone:  “In law husband and wife are one person, and the  husband is that person. Thus a wife in England had no  legal identity and hence no right to own property in her  own name. Even the wages she might earn belonged to  her husband. In France the Napoleonic Code (see pages  704–705) also enshrined the principle of female subordination  and gave the wife few legal rights regarding property,  divorce, and custody of the children. Legal inferiority  for women permeated Western society. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With all women facing discrimination in education and  employment and with middle-class women suffering especially  from a lack of legal rights, there is little wonder that  some women rebelled and began the long-continuing fight  for equality of the sexes and the rights of women. Their  struggle proceeded on two main fronts. First, following in  the steps of women such as Mary Wollstonecraft (see page  694), organizations founded by middle-class feminists "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" campaigned for equal legal rights for women as well as access  to higher education and professional employment.  These middle-class feminists argued that unmarried women  and middle-class widows with inadequate incomes simply  had to have more opportunities to support themselves.  Middle-class feminists also recognized that paid (as opposed  to unpaid) work could relieve the monotony that  some women found in their sheltered middle-class existence  and put greater meaning into their lives. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the later nineteenth century, these organizations  scored some significant victories, such as the 1882 law  giving English married women full property rights. More  women found professional and white-collar employment,  especially after about 1880. But progress was slow and  hard won. For example, in Germany before 1900, women  were not admitted as fully registered students at a single  university, and it was virtually impossible for a woman to  receive certification and practice as a lawyer or doctor.  (See the feature “Individuals in Society: Franziska Tiburtius.)  In the years before 1914, middle-class feminists increasingly  focused their attention on political action and  fought for the right to vote for women. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Women inspired by utopian and especially Marxian socialism  blazed a second path. Often scorning the programs  of middle-class feminists, socialist women leaders  argued that the liberation of working-class women would  come only with the liberation of the entire working class  through revolution. In the meantime, they championed  the cause of workingwomen and won some practical improvements,  especially in Germany, where the socialist  movement was most effectively organized. In a general  way, these different approaches to women’s issues reflected  the diversity of classes in urban society. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" If the ideology and practice of rigidly separate spheres  undoubtedly narrowed women’s horizons and caused  some women to rebel, there was a brighter side to the  same coin. As home and children became the typical  wife’s main concerns in the late nineteenth century, her  control and influence there apparently became increasingly  strong throughout Europe. Among the English  working classes, it was the wife who generally determined  how the family’s money was spent. In many families, the  husband gave all his earnings to his wife to manage,  whatever the law might read. She returned to him only a  small allowance for carfare, beer, tobacco, and union  dues. All the major domestic decisions, from the children’s  schooling and religious instruction to the selec"}

One English feminist noted in 1908 that “though  legally women occupy a much inferior status than men  [in France], in practice they constitute the superior sex.  They are the power behind the throne.13 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Women ruled at home partly because running the urban  household was a complicated, demanding, and valuable  task. Twice-a-day food shopping, penny-pinching,  economizing, and the growing crusade against dirt—not  to mention child rearing—were a full-time occupation.  Nor were there any laborsaving appliances to help, and  even when servants were present, they had to be carefully  watched and supervised. Working yet another job for  wages outside the home had limited appeal for most married  women unless such earnings were essential for family  survival. Many married women in the working classes  did make a monetary contribution to family income by  taking in boarders or doing piecework at home in the  sweated industries (see page 794). "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The wife also guided the home because a good deal of  her effort was directed toward pampering her husband as  he expected. In countless humble households, she saw  that he had meat while she ate bread, that he relaxed by  the fire while she did the dishes. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The woman’s guidance of the household went hand in  hand with the increased emotional importance of home  and family. The home she ran was idealized as a warm  shelter in a hard and impersonal urban world. For a child  of the English slums in the early 1900s, "}

Few walls in lower-working-class houses lacked  “mottoes—colored strips of paper, about nine inches wide  and eighteen inches in length, attesting to domestic joys:  EAST, WEST, HOME’S BEST; BLESS OUR HOME; GOD  IS MASTER OF THIS HOUSE; HOME IS THE NEST  WHERE ALL IS BEST.14 "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Why did a small number of women in the late nineteenth  century brave great odds and embark on professional  careers? And how did a few of those manage to  reach their objectives? The career and personal reflections  of Franziska Tiburtius, a pioneer in German medicine,  suggest that talent, determination, and economic  necessity were critical ingredients.* "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Like many women of her time who would study and  pursue professional careers, Franziska Tiburtius  (1843–1927) was born into a property-owning family  of modest means. The youngest of nine children on a  small estate in northeastern Germany, the sensitive  child wilted under a harsh governess but flowered with  a caring teacher and became an excellent student. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Graduating at sixteen and needing to support herself,  Tiburtius had few opportunities. A young woman  from a “proper background could work as a governess  or a teacher without losing her respectability  and spoiling her matrimonial prospects, but that was  about it. She tried both avenues. Working for six years  as a governess in a noble family and no doubt learning  that poverty was often one’s fate in this genteel profession,  she then turned to teaching. Called home from  her studies in Britain in 1871 to care for her brother,  who had contracted typhus as a field doctor in the  Franco-Prussian War, she found her calling. She decided  to become a medical doctor. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Supported by her family, Tiburtius’s decision was  truly audacious. In all Europe, only the University of  Zurich in republican Switzerland accepted female students.  Moreover, if it became known that she had studied  medicine and failed, she would never get a job as a  teacher. No parent would entrust a daughter to an  “emancipated radical who had carved up dead bodies! "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Although the male students at the university sometimes  harassed the women with crude pranks, Tiburtius  thrived. The revolution of the microscope and the discovery  of microorganisms was rocking Zurich, and she  was fascinated by her studies. She became close friends  with a fellow female medical student from Germany,  Emilie Lehmus, with whom she would form a lifelong  partnership in medicine. She did her internship with  families of cottage workers around Zurich and loved  her work. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Tiburtius and Lehmus became famous. For fifteen  years, they were the only women doctors in all Berlin.  An inspiration for a new generation of women, they  added the wealthy to their thriving practice. But Tiburtius’s  clinics always concentrated on the poor, providing  them with subsidized and up-to-date treatment.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Many French marriage manuals of the late 1800s  stressed that women had legitimate sexual needs, such as  the “right to orgasm. Perhaps the French were a bit more  enlightened in these matters than other nationalities. But  the rise of public socializing by couples in cafés and music  halls as well as franker affection within the family suggests  a more erotic, pleasurable intimate life for women  throughout Western society. This, too, helped make the  woman’s role as mother and homemaker acceptable and  even satisfying. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Child Rearing "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" One striking sign of deepening emotional ties within the  family was the growing love and concern that mothers  gave their tiny infants. Because so many babies died so  early in life, mothers in preindustrial Western society often  avoided making a strong emotional commitment to a  newborn in order to shield themselves from recurrent  heartbreak. Early emotional bonding and a willingness to  make real sacrifices for the welfare of the infant were beginning  to spread among the comfortable classes by the  end of the eighteenth century, but the ordinary mother  of modest means adopted new attitudes only as the nineteenth  century progressed. The baby became more important,  and women became better mothers. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Mothers increasingly breast-fed their infants, for example,  rather than paying wet nurses to do so. Breastfeeding  involved sacrifice—a temporary loss of freedom,  if nothing else. Yet in an age when there was no good alternative  to mother’s milk, it saved lives.

{"prompt":"","completion":" The loving care lavished on infants was matched by  greater concern for older children and adolescents. They,  too, were wrapped in the strong emotional ties of a more  intimate and protective family. For one thing, European  women began to limit the number of children they bore in  order to care adequately for those they had. It was evident  by the end of the nineteenth century that the birthrate was  declining across Europe, as Figure 24.4 shows, and it  continued to do so until after World War II. The Englishwoman  who married in the 1860s, for example, had an  average of about six children; her daughter marrying in the  1890s had only four; and her granddaughter marrying in  the 1920s had only two or possibly three.

{"prompt":"","completion":" 803  A Working-Class Home, 1875 Emotional ties within ordinary families grew stronger in the nineteenth  century. Parents gave their children more love and better care. (Illustrated London News Library) "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The most important reason for this revolutionary  reduction in family size, in which the comfortable and  well-educated classes took the lead, was parents’ desire to  improve their economic and social position and that of  their children. Children were no longer an economic  asset in the later nineteenth century. By having fewer  youngsters, parents could give those they had valuable  advantages, from music lessons and summer vacations  to long, expensive university educations and suitable  dowries. A young German skilled worker with only one  child spoke for many in his class when he said, “We want  to get ahead, and our daughter should have things better  than my wife and sisters did.17 Thus the growing  tendency of couples in the late nineteenth century to  use a variety of contraceptive methods—rhythm method,  withdrawal method, and mechanical devices—certainly  reflected increased concern for children. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Indeed, many parents, especially in the middle classes,  probably became too concerned about their children, unwittingly  subjecting them to an emotional pressure cooker "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" of almost unbearable intensity. The result was that many  children and especially adolescents came to feel trapped  and in need of greater independence. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Prevailing biological and medical theories led parents  to believe in the possibility that their own emotional characteristics  were passed on to their offspring and that they  were thus directly responsible for any abnormality in a  child. The moment the child was conceived was thought  to be of enormous importance. “Never run the risk of  conception when you are sick or over-tired or unhappy,  wrote one influential American woman. “For the bodily  condition of the child, its vigor and magnetic qualities, are  much affected by conditions ruling this great moment.18  So might the youthful “sexual excess of the father curse  future generations. Although this was true in the case of  syphilis, which could be transmitted to unborn children,  the rigid determinism of such views left little scope for the  child’s individual development. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Another area of excessive parental concern was the sexual  behavior of the child. Masturbation was viewed with "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \f 804 804  CHAPTER 24 • LIFE IN THE EMERGING URBAN SOCIETY IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" horror, for it represented an act of independence and  even defiance. Diet, clothing, games, and sleeping were  carefully regulated. Girls were discouraged from riding  horses and bicycling because rhythmic friction simulated  masturbation. Boys were dressed in trousers with shallow  and widely separated pockets. Between 1850 and 1880,  there were surgical operations for children who persisted  in masturbating. Thereafter until about 1905, various restraining  apparatuses were more often used. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" These and less blatant attempts to repress the child’s  sexuality were a source of unhealthy tension, often made  worse by the rigid division of gender roles within the  family. It was widely believed that mother and child loved  each other easily but that relations between father and  child were necessarily difficult and often tragic. The father  was a stranger; his world of business was far removed  from the maternal world of spontaneous affection. Moreover,  the father was demanding, often expecting the child  to succeed where he himself had failed and making his  love conditional on achievement. Little wonder that the  imaginative literature of the late nineteenth century came  to deal with the emotional and destructive elements of  father-son relationships. In the Russian Feodor Dostoevski’s  great novel The Brothers Karamazov (1880–1881),  for example, four sons work knowingly or unknowingly  to destroy their father. Later at the murder trial, one of  the brothers claims to speak for all mankind and screams  out, “Who doesn’t wish his father dead? "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Sigmund Freud (1856–1939), the Viennese founder of  psychoanalysis, formulated the most striking analysis of the  explosive dynamics of the family, particularly the middle- class family in the late nineteenth century. A physician by  training, Freud began his career treating mentally ill patients.  He noted that the hysteria of his patients appeared  to originate in bitter early-childhood experiences wherein  the child had been obliged to repress strong feelings.  When these painful experiences were recalled and reproduced  under hypnosis or through the patient’s free association  of ideas, the patient could be brought to understand  his or her unhappiness and eventually deal with it. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" One of Freud’s most influential ideas concerned the  Oedipal tensions resulting from the son’s instinctive  competition with the father for the mother’s love and affection.  More generally, Freud postulated that much of  human behavior is motivated by unconscious emotional  needs whose nature and origins are kept from conscious  awareness by various mental devices he called defense  mechanisms. Freud concluded that much unconscious  psychological energy is sexual energy, which is repressed  and precariously controlled by rational thinking and  moral rules. If Freud exaggerated the sexual and familial "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" roots of adult behavior, that exaggeration was itself a reflection  of the tremendous emotional intensity of family  life in the late nineteenth century. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The working classes probably had more avenues of  escape from such tensions than did the middle classes.  Unlike their middle-class counterparts, who remained  economically dependent on their families until a long  education was finished or a proper marriage secured,  working-class boys and girls went to work when they  reached adolescence. Earning wages on their own, they  could bargain with their parents for greater independence  within the household by the time they were sixteen  or seventeen. If they were unsuccessful, they could  and did leave home to live cheaply as paying lodgers in  other working-class homes. Thus the young person from  the working classes broke away from the family more easily  when emotional ties became oppressive. In the twentieth  century, middle-class youths would follow this lead. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Major changes in Western science and thought accompanied  the emergence of urban society. Two aspects of these  complex intellectual developments stand out as especially  significant. First, scientific knowledge expanded rapidly,  influencing the Western worldview even more profoundly  than ever before and spurring the creation of new products  and whole industries. Second, between about the 1840s  and the 1890s, European literature underwent a shift from  soaring romanticism to tough-minded realism. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" • What major changes in science and thought reflected and  influenced the new urban society?  The Triumph of Science "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As the pace of scientific advance quickened and as theoretical  advances resulted in great practical benefits, science  exercised growing influence on human thought. The intellectual  achievements of the scientific revolution had resulted  in few such benefits, and theoretical knowledge had also  played a relatively small role in the Industrial Revolution in  England. But breakthroughs in industrial technology enormously  stimulated basic scientific inquiry, as researchers  sought to explain theoretically how such things as steam engines  and blast furnaces actually worked. The result was an  explosive growth of fundamental scientific discoveries from  the 1830s onward. And in contrast to earlier periods, these  theoretical discoveries were increasingly transformed into  material improvements for the general population. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \f Science and Thought • "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 805  A perfect example of the translation of better scientific  knowledge into practical human benefits was the work of  Louis Pasteur and his followers in biology and the medical  sciences. Another was the development of the branch of  physics known as thermodynamics. Building on Isaac  Newton’s laws of mechanics and on studies of steam  engines, thermodynamics investigated the relationship  between heat and mechanical energy. By midcentury,  physicists had formulated the fundamental laws of thermodynamics,  which were then applied to mechanical engineering,  chemical processes, and many other fields. The law  of conservation of energy held that different forms of  energy—such as heat, electricity, and magnetism—could be  converted but neither created nor destroyed. Nineteenth- century thermodynamics demonstrated that the physical  world was governed by firm, unchanging laws. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Chemistry and electricity were two other fields characterized  by extremely rapid scientific progress. And in  both fields, “science was put in the service of industry,  as the influential economist Alfred Marshall (1842–  1924) argued at the time. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Chemists devised ways of measuring the atomic weight  of different elements, and in 1869 the Russian chemist  Dmitri Mendeleev (1834–1907) codified the rules of  chemistry in the periodic law and the periodic table.  Chemistry was subdivided into many specialized branches,  such as organic chemistry—the study of the compounds  of carbon. Applying theoretical insights gleaned from this  new field, researchers in large German chemical companies  discovered ways of transforming the dirty, useless coal tar  that accumulated in coke ovens into beautiful, expensive  synthetic dyes for the world of fashion. The basic discoveries  of Michael Faraday (1791–1867) in electromagnetism  in the 1830s and 1840s resulted in the first dynamo (generator)  and opened the way for the subsequent development  of the telegraph, electric motor, electric light, and  electric streetcar. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The successful application of scientific research in the  fast-growing electrical and organic chemical industries  promoted solid economic growth between 1880 and  1913 and provided a model for other industries. Systematic  “R & D—research and development—was born in  the late nineteenth century. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The triumph of science and technology had at least  three more significant consequences. First, though ordinary  citizens continued to lack detailed scientific knowledge,  everyday experience and innumerable popularizers  impressed the importance of science on the popular mind. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Second, as science became more prominent in popular  thinking, the philosophical implications of science formulated  in the Enlightenment spread to broad sections "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" of the population. Natural processes appeared to be determined  by rigid laws, leaving little room for either  divine intervention or human will. Yet scientific and technical  advances had also fed the Enlightenment’s optimistic  faith in human progress, which now appeared  endless and automatic to many middle-class minds. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Third, the methods of science acquired unrivaled prestige  after 1850. For many, the union of careful experiment  and abstract theory was the only reliable route to truth and  objective reality. The “unscientific intuitions of poets and  the revelations of saints seemed hopelessly inferior. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Social Science and Evolution "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" From the 1830s onward, many thinkers tried to apply the  objective methods of science to the study of society. In  some ways, these efforts simply perpetuated the critical  thinking of the philosophes. Yet there were important  differences. The new “social scientists had access to the  massive sets of numerical data that governments had begun  to collect on everything from children to crime, from  population to prostitution. In response, social scientists  developed new statistical methods to analyze these facts  “scientifically and supposedly to test their theories. And  the systems of the leading nineteenth-century social scientists  were more unified, all-encompassing, and dogmatic  than those of the philosophes. Marx was a prime  example (see pages 757–758). "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Another extremely influential system builder was French  philosopher Auguste Comte (1798–1857). Initially a disciple  of the utopian socialist Saint-Simon (see page 756),  Comte wrote the six-volume System of Positive Philosophy  (1830–1842), which was largely overlooked during the  romantic era. But when the political failures of 1848 completed  the swing to realism, Comte’s philosophy came into  its own. Its influence has remained great to this day. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Comte postulated that all intellectual activity progresses  through predictable stages: "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The great fundamental law...is this:—that each of our  leading conceptions—each branch of our knowledge—  passes successively through three different theoretical conditions:  the Theological, or fictitious; the Metaphysical, or  abstract; and the Scientific, or positive....

{"prompt":"","completion":" Comte’s stages of knowledge exemplify the nineteenth- century fascination with the idea of evolution and dynamic  development. Thinkers in many fields, such as the romantic  historians and “scientific Marxists, shared and applied  this basic concept.

{"prompt":"","completion":" \f such as biblical floods and earthquakes. Instead, according  to Lyell’s principle of uniformitarianism, the same geological  processes that are at work today slowly formed the  earth’s surface over an immensely long time. The evolutionary  view of biological development, first proposed by  the Greek Anaximander in the sixth century B.C., reemerged  in a more modern form in the work of Jean Baptiste  Lamarck (1744–1829). Lamarck asserted that all  forms of life had arisen through a long process of continuous  adjustment to the environment. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Lamarck’s work was flawed—he believed that the characteristics  parents acquired in the course of their lives  could be inherited by their children—and was not accepted,  but it helped prepare the way for Charles Darwin  (1809–1882), the most influential of all nineteenth- century evolutionary thinkers. As the official naturalist on  a five-year scientific cruise to Latin America and the South  Pacific beginning in 1831, Darwin carefully collected  specimens of the different animal species he encountered  on the voyage. Back in England, convinced by fossil evidence  and by his friend Lyell that the earth and life on it  were immensely ancient, Darwin came to doubt the general  belief in a special divine creation of each species of animal.  Instead, he concluded, all life had gradually evolved  from a common ancestral origin in an unending “struggle  for survival. After long hesitation, Darwin published his  research, which immediately attracted wide attention. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Darwin’s great originality lay in suggesting precisely  how biological evolution might have occurred. His theory  is summarized in the title of his work On the Origin of  Species by the Means of Natural Selection (1859). Decisively  influenced by Thomas Malthus’s gloomy theory  that populations naturally grow faster than their food  supplies (see page 726), Darwin argued that chance differences  among the members of a given species help  some survive while others die. Thus the variations that  prove useful in the struggle for survival are selected naturally  and gradually spread to the entire species through  reproduction. Darwin did not explain why such variations  occurred in the first place, and not until the early  twentieth century did the study of genetics and the concept  of mutation provide some answers. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" In literature, the key themes of realism emerged in the  1840s and continued to dominate Western culture and  style until the 1890s. Realist writers believed that literature  should depict life exactly as it was. Forsaking poetry  for prose and the personal, emotional viewpoint of the  romantics for strict, scientific objectivity, the realists simply  observed and recorded—content to let the facts speak  for themselves. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The major realist writers focused their extraordinary  powers of observation on contemporary everyday life.  Emphatically rejecting the romantic search for the exotic  and the sublime, they energetically pursued the typical  and the commonplace. Beginning with a dissection of the  middle classes, from which most of them sprang, many  realists eventually focused on the working classes, especially  the urban working classes, which had been neglected in  imaginative literature before this time. The realists put a  microscope to many unexplored and taboo subjects—sex,  strikes, violence, alcoholism—and hastened to report that  slums and factories teemed with savage behavior. Many  shocked middle-class critics denounced realism as ugly  sensationalism wrapped provocatively in pseudoscientific  declarations and crude language. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Realism quickly spread beyond France. In England,  Mary Ann Evans (1819–1880), who wrote under the  pen name George Eliot, brilliantly achieved a more  deeply felt, less sensational kind of realism. “It is the  habit of my imagination, George Eliot wrote, “to strive  after as full a vision of the medium in which a character  moves as one of the character itself. Her great novel  Middlemarch: A Study of Provincial Life (1871–1872) examines  masterfully the ways in which people are shaped  by their social medium as well as their own inner strivings,  conflicts, and moral choices. Thomas Hardy  (1840–1928) was more in the Zola tradition. His novels,  such as Tess of the D’Urbervilles (1891) and The Return of  the Native (1878), depict men and women frustrated and  crushed by fate and bad luck. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Thoroughgoing realism (or “naturalism, as it was often  called) arrived late in the United States, most arrestingly  in the work of Theodore Dreiser (1871–1945).

{"prompt":"","completion":" The greatest Russian realist, Count Leo Tolstoy  (1828–1910), combined realism in description and character  development with an atypical moralizing, which  came to dominate his later work. Tolstoy’s greatest work  is War and Peace (1864–1869), a monumental novel set  against the historical background of Napoleon’s invasion  of Russia in 1812. Tolstoy probed deeply into the lives of  a multitude of unforgettable characters, such as the ill- fated Prince Andrei; the shy, fumbling Pierre; and the enchanting,  level-headed Natasha. Tolstoy went to great  pains to develop his fatalistic theory of history, which regards  free will as an illusion and the achievements of even  the greatest leaders as only the channeling of historical  necessity.

{"prompt":"","completion":" ACE the Test Chapter Summary  • What was life like in the cities, and how did urban  life change in the nineteenth century?  • What did the emergence of urban industrial society  mean for rich and poor and those in between?  • How did families change as they coped with the  challenges and the opportunities of the developing  urban civilization?  • What major changes in science and thought reflected  and influenced the new urban society?  higher real wages, increased social security, political par- ticipation, and education. Urban society in the late nine- teenth century represented a long step forward for  humanity, but it remained very unequal.  Inequality was a favorite theme of realist novelists such  as Balzac and Zola. More generally, literary realism re- flected Western society’s growing faith in science, mate- rial progress, and evolutionary thinking. The emergence  of urban, industrial civilization accelerated the seculariza- tion of the Western worldview.  The revolution in industry had a decisive influence on the  urban environment. The populations of towns and cities  grew rapidly because it was economically advantageous to  locate factories and offices in urban areas. This rapid  growth worsened long-standing overcrowding and unhealthy  living conditions and posed a frightening challenge  for society. Eventually government leaders, city planners,  reformers, scientists, and ordinary citizens responded. They  took effective action in public health and provided themselves  with other badly needed urban services. Gradually  they tamed the ferocious savagery of the traditional city. "}

Urban  society featured many distinct social groups, which existed  in a state of constant flux and competition.

But what is more,  they also demanded secrecy and reserve from us in  this connection.... "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This “social morality, which on the one hand  privately presupposed the existence of sexuality  and its natural course, but on the other would  not recognize it openly at any price, was doubly  deceitful. While it winked one eye at a young man  and even encouraged him with the other “to sow  his wild oats, as the kindly language of the home  put it, in the case of a woman it studiously shut  both eyes and acted as if it were blind. That a man  could experience desires, and was permitted to "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" experience them, was silently admitted by custom.  But to admit frankly that a woman could be  subject to similar desires, or that creation for its  eternal purposes also required a female polarity,  would have transgressed the conception of the  “sanctity of womanhood. In the pre-Freudian  era, therefore, the axiom was agreed upon that a  female person could have no physical desires as  long as they had not been awakened by man, and  that, obviously, was officially permitted only in  marriage. But even in those moral times, in Vienna  in particular, the air was full of dangerous erotic  infection, and a girl of good family had to live in a  completely sterilized atmosphere, from the day of  her birth until the day when she left the altar on  her husband’s arm. In order to protect young  girls, they were not left alone for a single  moment. . . . Every book which they read was  inspected, and above all else, young girls were  constantly kept busy to divert their attention from  any possible dangerous thoughts. They had to  practise the piano, learn singing and drawing,  foreign languages, and the history of literature and  art. They were educated and overeducated. But  while the aim was to make them as educated and  as socially correct as possible, at the same time  society anxiously took great pains that they should  remain innocent of all natural things to a degree  unthinkable today. A young girl of good family  was not allowed to have any idea of how the male  body was formed, or to know how children came  into the world, for the angel was to enter into  matrimony not only physically untouched, but  completely “pure spiritually as well. “Good  breeding, for a young girl of that time, was  identical with ignorance of life; and this ignorance  ofttimes lasted for the rest of their lives....

{"prompt":"","completion":" Those days did not give him too many  opportunities. Only a very few particularly rich  young men could afford the luxury of keeping a  mistress, that is, taking an apartment and paying  her expenses.

The others helped themselves for the  most part with shopgirls and waitresses, and this  offered little inner satisfaction. . . . But, generally  speaking, prostitution was still the foundation of  the erotic life outside of marriage; in a certain  sense it constituted a dark underground vault over  which rose the gorgeous structure of middle-class  society with its faultless, radiant façade.

Whereas today it is as rare to  meet a prostitute on the streets of a big city as it is  to meet a wagon in the road, then the sidewalks  were so sprinkled with women for sale that it was  more difficult to avoid than to find them. To this  was added the countless number of “closed  houses, the night clubs, the cabarets, the dance  parlours with their dancers and singers, and the  bars with their “come-on girls. At that time  female wares were offered for sale at every hour  and at every price. . . . And this was the same city,  the same society, the same morality, that was  indignant when young girls rode bicycles, and  declared it a disgrace to the dignity of science when  Freud in his calm, clear, and penetrating manner  established truths that they did not wish to be true.  The same world that so pathetically defended the  purity of womanhood allowed this cruel sale of  women, organized it, and even profited thereby. "}

To what extent might  the expanding urban middle classes and even portions of  the growing working classes rally to a strong and essentially  conservative national state? This was one of the  great political questions in the 1850s and 1860s. In central  Europe, a resounding answer came with the national  unification of Italy and Germany. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" • How did the process of unification in Italy and Germany  create conservative nation-states? "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Italy to 1850 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Italy had never been united prior to 1850. Part of Rome’s  great empire in ancient times, the Italian peninsula was  divided in the Middle Ages into competing city-states  that led the commercial and cultural revival of the West  with amazing creativity.

Sardinia and  Piedmont were under the rule of an Italian monarch, and  Tuscany, with its famous capital Florence, shared north- central Italy with several smaller states. Central Italy and  Rome were ruled by the papacy, which had always considered  an independent political existence necessary to  fulfill its spiritual mission. Naples and Sicily were ruled, as  they had been for almost a hundred years, by a branch of  the Bourbons. Metternich was not wrong in dismissing  Italy as “a geographical expression (see Map 25.1). "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Between 1815 and 1848, the goal of a unified Italian  nation captured the imaginations of many Italians. There  were three basic approaches. The first was the radical  program of the idealistic patriot Giuseppe Mazzini, who  preached a centralized democratic republic based on universal  male suffrage and the will of the people (see page  755). The second was that of Vincenzo Gioberti, a  Catholic priest who called for a federation of existing  states under the presidency of a progressive pope. The  third was the program of those who looked for leadership  to the autocratic kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont, much  as many Germans looked to Prussia. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The third alternative was strengthened by the failures of  1848, when Austria smashed Mazzini’s republicanism. Almost  by accident, Sardinia’s monarch, Victor Emmanuel,  retained the liberal constitution granted under duress in  March 1848. This constitution provided for a fair degree  of civil liberties and real parliamentary government, with  deputies elected by a limited franchise based on income.  To the Italian middle classes, Sardinia appeared to be a liberal,  progressive state ideally suited to achieve the goal of  national unification. By contrast, Mazzini’s brand of democratic  republicanism seemed quixotic and too radical. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As for the papacy, the initial cautious support by Pius  IX (r. 1846–1878) for unification had given way to fear  and hostility after he was temporarily driven from Rome  during the upheavals of 1848. For a long generation, the  papacy would stand resolutely opposed not only to national  unification but also to most modern trends. In  1864 in the Syllabus of Errors, Pius IX strongly denounced  rationalism, socialism, separation of church and state, and  religious liberty, denying that “the Roman pontiff can  and ought to reconcile and align himself with progress,  liberalism, and modern civilization.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Finally, in July 1858 Cavour succeeded and goaded  Austria into attacking Sardinia in 1859. Napoleon III  came to Sardinia’s defense. Then after the victory of the  combined Franco-Sardinian forces, Napoleon III did a  sudden about-face. Deciding it was not in his interest to  have too strong a state on his southern border and criticized  by French Catholics for supporting the pope’s declared  enemy, Napoleon III abandoned Cavour.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Yet Cavour’s plans were salvaged by the skillful maneuvers  of his allies in the moderate nationalist movement.  While the war against Austria had raged in the north, pro- Sardinian nationalists in central Italy had fanned popular  revolts and driven out their easily toppled princes. Using  and controlling the popular enthusiasm, the middle-class  nationalist leaders in central Italy called for fusion with  Sardinia. This was not at all what France and the other  Great Powers wanted, but the nationalists held firm.  Cavour returned to power in early 1860 and gained  Napoleon III’s support by ceding Savoy and Nice to  France. The people of central Italy then voted overwhelmingly  to join a greatly enlarged kingdom of Sardinia.  Cavour had achieved his original goal of a northern  Italian state (see Map 25.1). "}

The  son of a poor sailor, Garibaldi personified the romantic,  revolutionary nationalism and republicanism of Mazzini  and 1848. Leading a corps of volunteers against Austria  in 1859, Garibaldi emerged in 1860 as an independent  force in Italian politics. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Partly to use him and partly to get rid of him, Cavour  secretly supported Garibaldi’s bold plan to “liberate the  kingdom of the Two Sicilies. Landing on the shores of  Sicily in May 1860, Garibaldi’s guerrilla band of a thousand  Red Shirts captured the imagination of the Sicilian  peasantry. Outwitting the twenty-thousand-man royal  army, the guerrilla leader won battles, gained volunteers,  and took Palermo. Then he and his men crossed to the  mainland, marched triumphantly toward Naples, and prepared  to attack Rome and the pope. But the wily Cavour  quickly sent Sardinian forces to occupy most of the Papal  States (but not Rome) and to intercept Garibaldi. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Cavour realized that an attack on Rome would bring  about war with France, and he also feared Garibaldi’s  radicalism and popular appeal. Thus he immediately organized  a plebiscite in the conquered territories. Despite  the urging of some radical supporters, the patriotic Garibaldi  did not oppose Cavour, and the people of the south  voted to join Sardinia. When Garibaldi and Victor Emmanuel  rode through Naples to cheering crowds, they  symbolically sealed the union of north and south, of  monarch and nation-state. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Cavour had succeeded. He had controlled Garibaldi  and had turned popular nationalism in a conservative direction.  The new kingdom of Italy, which expanded to  include Venice in 1866 and Rome in 1870, was a parliamentary  monarchy under Victor Emmanuel, neither radical  nor democratic. Despite political unity, only a small  minority of Italian males had the right to vote. The propertied  classes and the common people were divided. A  great and growing social and cultural gap separated the  progressive, industrializing north from the stagnant,  agrarian south. The new Italy was united on paper, but  profound divisions remained.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Germany Before Bismarck "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the aftermath of 1848, the German states were locked in  a political stalemate. After Austria and Russia blocked Frederick  William’s attempt to unify Germany “from above,  tension grew between Austria and Prussia as each power  sought to block the other within the German Confederation  (see pages 751 and 773–774). Stalemate also prevailed  in the domestic politics of the individual states in the 1850s. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" At the same time, powerful economic forces were undermining  the political status quo. Modern industry grew  rapidly within the German customs union, or Zollverein,  founded in 1834 to stimulate trade and increase the revenues  of member states. The Zollverein had not included  Austria, and after 1848 this exclusion became a crucial  factor in the Austro-Prussian rivalry. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Zollverein’s tariff duties were substantially reduced  so that Austria’s highly protected industry could  not bear to join. In retaliation, Austria tried to destroy  the Zollverein, but without success. Indeed, by the end  of 1853 all the German states except Austria had joined  the customs union. A new Germany excluding Austria  was becoming an economic reality. Middle-class and  business groups in the Zollverein were enriching themselves  and finding solid economic reasons to bolster their  idealistic support of national unification. Prussia’s leading  role within the Zollverein gave it a valuable advantage  in its struggle against Austria’s supremacy in German  political affairs. "}

Prussia had emerged from 1848 with a parliament of  sorts, which was in the hands of the liberal middle  class by 1859. The wealthy middle class wanted society  to be less, not more, militaristic. Above all, middle-class  representatives wanted to establish once and for all that  the parliament, not the king, had the ultimate political  power and that the army was responsible to Prussia’s  elected representatives. These demands were popular.  The parliament rejected the military budget in 1862, and  the liberals triumphed completely in new elections.

Yet in his drive to  secure power for himself and for Prussia, Bismarck was  extraordinarily flexible and pragmatic. “One must always  have two irons in the fire, he once said. He kept his options  open, pursuing one policy and then another as he  moved with skill and cunning toward his goal. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Bismarck first honed his political skills as a high-ranking  diplomat for the Prussian government. When he took office  as chief minister in 1862, he made a strong but unfavorable  impression. His speeches were a sensation and a  scandal.

Denounced for this view that “might makes right,  Bismarck had the Prussian bureaucracy go right on collecting  taxes, even though the parliament refused to approve  the budget. Bismarck reorganized the army. And  for four years, from 1862 to 1866, the voters of Prussia  continued to express their opposition by sending large  liberal majorities to the parliament. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Opposition at home spurred the search for success  abroad. The ever-knotty question of Schleswig-Holstein  provided a welcome opportunity. In 1864, when the  Danish king tried again, as in 1848, to bring the provinces  into a more centralized Danish state against the will of the  German Confederation, Prussia joined Austria in a short  and successful war against Denmark. However, Bismarck  was convinced that Prussia had to control completely the  northern, predominately Protestant part of the German  Confederation, which meant expelling Austria from German  affairs. After the victory over Denmark, Bismarck’s  skillful maneuvering had Prussia in a position to force  Austria out by war, if necessary. Bismarck knew that a war  with Austria would have to be a localized one that would  not provoke a mighty alliance against Prussia. By skillfully  neutralizing Russia and France, he was in a position to engage  in a war of his own making. "}

The mainly Catholic states of  the south remained independent while forming alliances  with Prussia. Bismarck’s fundamental goal of Prussian expansion  was being realized (see Map 25.2). "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Taming of the Parliament "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Bismarck had long been convinced that the old order he  so ardently defended should make peace, on its own  terms, with the liberal middle class and the nationalist  movement. He realized that nationalism was not necessarily  hostile to conservative, authoritarian government.  Moreover, Bismarck believed that because of the events  of 1848, the German middle class could be led to prefer  the reality of national unity under conservative leadership  to a long, uncertain battle for truly liberal institutions.  During the constitutional struggle over army reform and  parliamentary authority, he had delayed but not abandoned  this goal. Thus during the attack on Austria in  1866, he increasingly identified Prussia’s fate with the  “national development of Germany. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the aftermath of victory, Bismarck fashioned a federal  constitution for the new North German Confederation.  Each state retained its own local government, but the king  of Prussia became president of the confederation, and the  chancellor—Bismarck—was responsible only to the president.  The federal government—William I and Bismarck—  controlled the army and foreign affairs. There was also a  legislature with members of the lower house elected by  universal, single-class, male suffrage. With this radical innovation,  Bismarck opened the door to popular participation  and the possibility of going over the head of the  middle class directly to the people, much as Napoleon III  had done in France. All the while, however, ultimate power  rested in the hands of Prussia and its king and army. "}

In sharp contrast, industry and cities did not develop  in the South, and newcomers avoided the region.  And even though three-quarters of all Southern white  families were small farmers and owned no slaves in 1850,  plantation owners holding twenty or more slaves dominated  the economy and society. These profit-minded slave  owners used gangs of black slaves to claim a vast new  kingdom across the Deep South where cotton was king  (see Map 25.3).

In the  early nineteenth century these governing elites in both  states were strongly opposed to representative government  and national self-determination, and they continued  to concentrate on absolutist rule and competition  with other Great Powers. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For both states relentless power politics led to serious  trouble. It became clear to the leaders of both empires  that they had to embrace the process of modernization,  defined narrowly and usefully as the changes that enable a  country to compete effectively with the leading countries  at a given time. This limited conception of modernization  fits Russia after the Crimean War particularly well, and it  helps explain developments in the Ottoman Empire. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" • What steps did Russia and the Ottoman Turks take  toward modernization, and how successful were they?  The “Great Reforms "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the 1850s, Russia was a poor agrarian society with a rapidly  growing population. Industry was little developed, and  almost 90 percent of the population lived off the land.  Agricultural techniques were backward, and serfdom was  still the basic social institution. Bound to the lord on a  hereditary basis, the peasant serf was little more than a  slave. Serfs were obliged to furnish labor services or money  payments as the lord saw fit. Moreover, the lord could  choose freely among the serfs for army recruits, who had to  serve for twenty-five years, and he could punish a serf with  deportation to Siberia. Sexual exploitation of female serfs  by their lords was common. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Serfdom had become the great moral and political issue  for the government by the 1840s. Then the Crimean War  of 1853 to 1856, arising out of a dispute with France over  who should protect certain Christian shrines in the Ottoman  Empire, brought crisis. Because the fighting was  concentrated in the Crimean peninsula on the Black Sea,  Russia’s transportation network of rivers and wagons  failed to supply the distant Russian armies adequately.  France and Great Britain, aided by Sardinia and the Ottoman  Empire, inflicted a humiliating defeat on Russia. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This military defeat marked a turning point in Russian  history because it demonstrated that Russia had fallen  behind the rapidly industrializing nations of western Europe  in many areas. At the very least, Russia needed railroads,  better armaments, and reorganization of the army  if it was to maintain its international position. Moreover,  the disastrous war had caused hardship and raised the  specter of massive peasant rebellion. Reform of serfdom  was imperative. Military disaster thus forced Alexander II "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" (r. 1855–1881) and his ministers along the path of rapid  social change and general modernization.  The first and greatest of the reforms was the freeing of  the serfs in 1861. Human bondage was abolished forever,  and the emancipated peasants received, on average, about  half of the land. Yet they had to pay fairly high prices for  their land, and because the land was owned collectively,  each peasant village was jointly responsible for the payments  of all the families in the village. Collective ownership  and responsibility made it very difficult for individual  peasants to improve agricultural methods or leave their  villages. Thus old patterns of behavior predominated, and  the effects of reform were limited. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Most of the later reforms were also halfway measures.  In 1864 the government established a new institution of  local government, the zemstvo. Members of this local  assembly were elected by a three-class system of towns,  peasant villages, and noble landowners. A zemstvo executive  council dealt with local problems. Russian liberals  hoped that this reform would lead to an elected national  parliament, but they were soon disappointed. The local  zemstvo remained subordinate to the traditional bureaucracy  and the local nobility. More successful was reform  of the legal system, which established independent  courts and equality before the law. Education and policies  toward Russian Jews were also liberalized somewhat,  and censorship was relaxed but not removed. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Until the twentieth century, Russia’s greatest strides  toward modernization were economic rather than political.  Industry and transport, both so vital to the military,  were transformed in two industrial surges. The first of  these came after 1860. The government encouraged and  subsidized private railway companies, and construction  boomed. In 1860 the empire had only about 1,250 miles  of railroads; by 1880 it had about 15,500 miles. The railroads  enabled agricultural Russia to export grain and thus  earn money for further industrialization. Industrial suburbs  grew up around Moscow and St. Petersburg, and a  class of modern factory workers began to take shape. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Industrial development strengthened Russia’s military  forces and gave rise to territorial expansion to the south  and east. Imperial expansion greatly excited many ardent  Russian nationalists and superpatriots, who became some  of the government’s most enthusiastic supporters. Industrial  development also contributed mightily to the spread  of Marxian thought and the transformation of the Russian  revolutionary movement after 1890. "}

The key leader was Sergei Witte, the tough,  competent minister of finance from 1892 to 1903. Inspired  by the writings of Friedrich List (see pages  731–732), Witte believed that the harsh reality of industrial  backwardness was threatening Russia’s power and  greatness. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Therefore, under Witte’s leadership the government  built state-owned railroads rapidly, doubling the network  to thirty-five thousand miles by the end of the century.  Witte established high protective tariffs to build Russian  industry, and he put the country on the gold standard  of the “civilized world in order to strengthen Russian finances. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" As is often the case, military disaster abroad brought  political upheaval at home. The business and professional  classes had long wanted to match economic with political  modernization. Their minimal goal was to turn the last of  Europe’s absolutist monarchies into a liberal, representative  regime. Factory workers, strategically concentrated  in the large cities, had all the grievances of early industrialization  and were organized in a radical and still illegal  labor movement. Peasants had gained little from the era  of reforms and were suffering from poverty and overpopulation.  At the same time, nationalist sentiment was  emerging among the empire’s minorities. The politically  and culturally dominant ethnic Russians were only about  45 percent of the population, and by 1900 some intellectuals  among the subject nationalities were calling for self- rule and autonomy. Separatist nationalism was strongest  among the Poles and Ukrainians. With the army pinned  down in Manchuria, all these currents of discontent converged  in the revolution of 1905. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The beginning of the revolution pointed up the incompetence  of the government. On a Sunday in January  1905, a massive crowd of workers and their families converged  peacefully on the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg  to present a petition to the tsar. Suddenly troops opened  fire, killing and wounding hundreds. The Bloody Sunday  massacre turned ordinary workers against the tsar and  produced a wave of general indignation. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Outlawed political parties came out into the open,  and by the summer of 1905 strikes, peasant uprisings,  revolts among minority nationalities, and troop mutinies  were sweeping the country. The revolutionary surge culminated  in October 1905 in a great paralyzing general strike,  which forced the government to capitulate. The tsar issued  the October Manifesto, which granted full civil rights and  promised a popularly elected Duma (parliament) with real  legislative power. The manifesto split the opposition. Frightened  middle-class leaders helped the government repress  the uprising and survive as a constitutional monarchy. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" On the eve of the opening of the first Duma in May  1906, the government issued the new constitution, the  Fundamental Laws. The tsar retained great powers. The  Duma, elected indirectly by universal male suffrage, and  a largely appointive upper house could debate and pass  laws, but the tsar had an absolute veto. As in Bismarck’s  Germany, the emperor appointed his ministers, who did  not need to command a majority in the Duma. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The disappointed, predominately middle-class liberals, "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" the largest group in the newly elected Duma, saw the  Fundamental Laws as a step backward. Efforts to cooperate  with the tsar’s ministers soon broke down.

Thereupon  he and his reactionary advisers unilaterally rewrote  the electoral law so as to increase greatly the weight of the  propertied classes at the expense of workers, peasants, and  national minorities. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The new law had the intended effect. With landowners  assured half the seats in the Duma, the government secured  a loyal majority in 1907 and again in 1912. Thus  armed, the tough, energetic chief minister, Peter Stolypin,  pushed through important agrarian reforms designed to  break down collective village ownership of land and encourage  the more enterprising peasants—his “wager on  the strong. In 1914, Russia was partially modernized, a  conservative constitutional monarchy with a peasant- based but industrializing economy. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Decline and Reform in  the Ottoman Empire "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Although the Ottoman Empire began to decline slowly  after reaching its high point of development under  Suleiman the Magnificent in the sixteenth century, the  Ottomans began in the eighteenth century to fall rapidly  behind western Europe in science, industrial skill, and  military technology. At the same time, Russia’s powerful  westernized army pushed southward, overrunning and  occupying Ottoman provinces on the Danube River. The  danger that the Great Powers of Europe would gradually  conquer the Ottoman Empire and divide up its vast territories  was real. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Caught up in the Napoleonic wars and losing more territory  to Russia, the Ottomans were forced in 1816 to  grant Serbia local autonomy. In 1830, the Greeks won  their national independence, while French armies began  their long and bloody conquest of the Arabic-speaking  province of Algeria (see pages 776–777). French efforts  to strip Algerians of their culture and identity were brutal  and persistent, eventually resulting in one of Africa’s most  bitter anticolonial struggles after 1945. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Ottoman weakness reflected the decline of the sultan’s  “slave army, the so-called janissary corps.

The  European powers, minus France, preferred a weak and  dependent Ottoman state to a strong and revitalized  Muslim entity under a dynamic leader such as Muhammad  Ali. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Intended to bring revolutionary modernization such  as that experienced by Japan in the Meiji era (see pages  870–872), the Tanzimat permitted partial recovery but  fell short of its goals for several reasons. First, the liberal  reforms failed to halt the growth of nationalism among  Christian subjects in the Balkans (see Chapter 29), which  resulted in crises and defeats that undermined all reform  efforts. Second, the Ottoman initiatives did not curtail  the appetite of Western imperialism, which secured a  stranglehold on the Ottoman economy. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Finally, equality before the law for all citizens and religious  communities actually increased religious disputes,  which were in turn exacerbated by the relentless interference  of the European powers. This development embittered  relations between the religious communities,  distracted the government from its reform mission, and  split Muslims into secularists and religious conservatives.  These Islamic conservatives became the most dependable  support of Sultan Abdülhamid (r. 1876–1909), who  abandoned the model of European liberalism in his long  and repressive reign. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The combination of declining international power  and conservative tyranny eventually led to a powerful  resurgence of the modernizing impulse among idealistic  Turkish exiles in Europe and young army officers in Istanbul.  These fervent patriots, the so-called Young Turks,  seized power in the revolution of 1908, and they forced  the sultan to implement reforms. Failing to stop the rising  tide of anti-Ottoman nationalism in the Balkans, the  Young Turks helped prepare the way for the birth of modern  secular Turkey after the defeat and collapse of the Ottoman  Empire in World War I (see pages 889–890).

{"prompt":"","completion":" • Why after 1871 did ordinary citizens feel a growing  loyalty to their governments?  General Trends "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Despite some major differences between countries, European  domestic politics after 1871 had a common framework,  the firmly established national state. The common  themes within that framework were the emergence of  mass politics and growing mass loyalty toward the national  state. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For good reason, ordinary people—the masses of an  industrializing, urbanizing society—felt increasing loyalty  to their governments. More people could vote. By  1914 universal male suffrage had become the rule rather  than the exception. This development had as much psychological  as political significance. Ordinary men were  no longer denied the right to vote because they lacked  wealth or education. They felt that they counted; they  could influence the government to some extent. They  were becoming “part of the system. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Women also began to demand the right to vote. The  women’s suffrage movement achieved its first success in  the western United States, and by 1913 women could vote  in twelve states. Europe, too, moved slowly in this direction.  In 1914 Norway gave the vote to most women. Elsewhere,  women such as the English Emmeline Pankhurst  were very militant in their demands. They heckled politicians  and held public demonstrations. These efforts generally  failed before 1914, but they prepared the way for the  triumph of the women’s suffrage movement immediately  after World War I. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As the right to vote spread, politicians and parties in  national parliaments represented the people more responsively.  The multiparty system prevailing in most countries  meant that parliamentary majorities were built on shifting  coalitions of different parties, and this gave individual  parties leverage to obtain benefits for their supporters.  Governments also passed laws to alleviate general problems,  thereby acquiring greater legitimacy and appearing  more worthy of support. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There was a less positive side to building support for  strong nation-states after 1871.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Bismarck moved to enact high tariffs on cheap grain  from the United States, Canada, and Russia, against  which less efficient European producers could not compete.  This won over not only the Catholic Center, whose  supporters were small farmers in western and southern  Germany, but also the Protestant Junkers, who had large  landholdings in the east. With the tariffs, then, Bismarck  won Catholic and conservative support. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Bismarck had been looking for a way to increase taxes,  and the solution he chose was higher tariffs. Many other  governments acted similarly. The 1880s and 1890s saw a  widespread return to protectionism. France, in particular,  established very high tariffs to protect agriculture and  industry, peasants and manufacturers, from foreign competition.  Thus the German government and other governments  responded effectively to a major economic problem  and won greater loyalty. The general rise of protectionism  in this period was also an outstanding example of the  dangers of self-centered nationalism: new tariffs led to international  name-calling and nasty trade wars. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As for socialism, Bismarck tried to stop its growth in  Germany because he genuinely feared its revolutionary  language and allegiance to a movement transcending the  nation-state. In 1878, after two attempts on the life of  William I by radicals (though not socialists), Bismarck used  a carefully orchestrated national outcry to ram through  the Reichstag a law that strictly controlled socialist meetings  and publications and outlawed the Social Democratic  Party, which was thereby driven underground. However,  German socialists displayed a discipline and organization  worthy of the Prussian army itself. Bismarck decided to  try another tack. "}

In 1883 he pushed through  the Reichstag the first of several modern social security  laws to help wage earners.

Henceforth sick, injured, and retired workers  could look forward to some regular benefits from the  state.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Primary Source: The Welfare State Is Born "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Increasingly, the great issues in German domestic politics  were socialism and the Marxian Social Democratic  Party. In 1890 the new emperor, the young, idealistic,  and unstable William II (r. 1888–1918), opposed Bismarck’s  attempt to renew the law outlawing the Social  Democratic Party. Eager to rule in his own right and to  earn the support of the workers, William II forced Bismarck  to resign. After the “dropping of the pilot, German  foreign policy changed profoundly and mostly for  the worse, but the government did pass new laws to aid  workers and to legalize socialist political activity. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Yet William II was no more successful than Bismarck in  getting workers to renounce socialism. Indeed, socialist  ideas spread rapidly, and more and more Social Democrats  were elected to the Reichstag in the 1890s. After opposing  a colonial war in German Southwest Africa in 1906  that led to important losses in the general elections of  1907, the German Social Democratic Party broadened its  base and adopted a more patriotic tone. In 1912 the party  scored a great electoral victory, becoming the largest single  party in the Reichstag. This victory shocked aristocrats  and their wealthy conservative middle-class allies, heightening  the fears of an impending socialist upheaval in both  groups. Yet the “revolutionary socialists were actually becoming  less radical in Germany.

{"prompt":"","completion":" The moderate republicans sought to preserve  their creation by winning the hearts  and minds of the next generation. Trade  unions were fully legalized, and France acquired  a colonial empire. More important,  a series of laws between 1879 and 1886 established  free compulsory elementary education  for both girls and boys. At the same  time, they greatly expanded the state system  of public tax-supported schools. In  France and elsewhere the general expansion  of public education served as a critical  nation-building tool throughout the Western  world in the late nineteenth century. In  France most elementary and much secondary  education had traditionally been in the  parochial schools of the Catholic Church,  which had long been hostile to republics  and to much of secular life. Free compulsory  elementary education in France became  secular republican education. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Although the educational reforms of the  1880s disturbed French Catholics, many of  them rallied to the republic in the 1890s.  The limited acceptance of the modern  world by the more liberal Pope Leo XIII  (1878–1903) eased tensions between church  and state. Unfortunately, the Dreyfus affair  changed all that. "}

His family  never doubted his innocence and fought to reopen the  case, enlisting the support of prominent republicans and  intellectuals such as novelist Emile Zola. In 1898 and  1899, the case split France apart. On one side was the  army, which had manufactured evidence against Dreyfus,  joined by anti-Semites and most of the Catholic establishment.  On the other side stood the civil libertarians  and most of the more radical republicans. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Primary Source: “J’Accuse the French Army "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This battle, which eventually led to Dreyfus’s being  declared innocent, revived republican feeling against the  church. Between 1901 and 1905, the government severed  all ties between the state and the Catholic Church after  centuries of close relations. The salaries of priests and  bishops were no longer paid by the government, and all  churches were given to local committees of lay Catholics.  Catholic schools were put on their own financially and  soon lost a third of their students. The state school system’s  power of indoctrination was greatly strengthened.  In France only the growing socialist movement, with its  very different and thoroughly secular ideology, stood in  opposition to patriotic, republican nationalism. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Great Britain and Ireland "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Britain in the late nineteenth century has often been seen  as a shining example of peaceful and successful political  evolution, where an effective two-party parliament skillfully  guided the country from classical liberalism to full- fledged democracy with hardly a misstep. This view of  Great Britain is not so much wrong as it is incomplete. After  the right to vote was granted to males of the solid middle  class in 1832, opinion leaders and politicians wrestled  with the uncertainties of a further expansion of the franchise.  In 1867 Benjamin Disraeli and the Conservatives extended  the vote to all middle-class males and the best-paid  workers in the Second Reform Bill, in order to broaden the  Conservative Party’s traditional base of aristocratic and  landed support. After 1867 English political parties and  electoral campaigns became more modern, and the “lower  orders appeared to vote as responsibly as their “betters.  Hence the Third Reform Bill of 1884 gave the vote to almost  every adult male. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" While the House of Commons was drifting toward  democracy, the House of Lords was content to slumber  nobly. Between 1901 and 1910, however, that bastion of  aristocratic conservatism tried to reassert itself. Acting as "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" supreme court of the land, it ruled against labor unions in  two important decisions. And after the Liberal Party came  to power in 1906, the Lords vetoed several measures  passed by the Commons, including the so-called People’s  Budget, which was designed to increase spending on social  welfare services. The Lords finally capitulated, as they  had done in 1832, when the king threatened to create  enough new peers to pass the bill. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Aristocratic conservatism yielded to popular democracy  once and for all. The result was that extensive social welfare  measures, slow to come to Great Britain, were passed  in a spectacular rush between 1906 and 1914. During  those years, the Liberal Party, inspired by the fiery  Welshman David Lloyd George (1863–1945), substantially  raised taxes on the rich as part of the People’s Budget.  This income helped the government pay for national  health insurance, unemployment benefits, old-age pensions,  and a host of other social measures. The state was  integrating the urban masses socially as well as politically. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This record of accomplishment was only part of the  story, however. On the eve of World War I, the unanswered  question of Ireland brought Great Britain to the  brink of civil war. The terrible Irish famine fueled an  Irish revolutionary movement. Thereafter, the English  slowly granted concessions, such as the abolition of the  privileges of the Anglican Church and rights for Irish peasants.  Liberal prime minister William Gladstone (1809–  1898), who had proclaimed twenty years earlier that  “my mission is to pacify Ireland, introduced bills to  give Ireland self-government in 1886 and in 1893. They  failed to pass. After two decades of relative quiet, Irish  nationalists in the British Parliament saw their chance.  They supported the Liberals in their battle for the People’s  Budget and received a home-rule bill for Ireland in  return. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Thus Ireland, the emerald isle, was on the brink of  achieving self-government. Yet Ireland was composed of  two peoples. As much as the Irish Catholic majority in  the southern counties wanted home rule, precisely that  much did the Irish Protestants of the northern counties  of Ulster come to oppose it. Motivated by the accumulated  fears and hostilities of generations, the Protestants  of Ulster refused to submerge themselves in a Catholic  Ireland, just as Irish Catholics had refused to submit to a  Protestant Britain.

It was only a matter  of time before the Serbs, Bulgarians, and Romanians would  break away, and they did. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Austro-Hungarian Empire "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The dilemma of conflicting nationalisms in Ireland also  helps one appreciate how desperate the situation in the  Austro-Hungarian Empire had become by the early twentieth  century. In 1849 Magyar nationalism had driven  Hungarian patriots to declare an independent Hungarian  republic, which was savagely crushed by Russian and Austrian  armies (see page 772). Throughout the 1850s, Hungary  was ruled as a conquered territory, and Emperor  Francis Joseph and his bureaucracy tried hard to centralize  the state and Germanize the language and culture of  the different nationalities.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Then in the wake of defeat by Prussia in 1866, a weakened  Austria was forced to strike a compromise and establish  the so-called dual monarchy. The empire was  divided in two, and the nationalistic Magyars gained virtual  independence for Hungary. Henceforth each half of  the empire agreed to deal with its own “barbarians—its  own minorities—as it saw fit. The two states were joined  only by a shared monarch and common ministries for finance,  defense, and foreign affairs. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In Austria ethnic Germans were only one-third of the  population, and in 1895 many Germans saw their traditional  dominance threatened by Czechs, Poles, and other  Slavs. A particularly emotional issue in the Austrian parliament  was the language used in government and elementary  education at the local level. From 1900 to 1914  the parliament was so divided that ministries generally  could not obtain a majority and ruled instead by decree.  Efforts by both conservatives and socialists to defuse national  antagonisms by stressing economic issues that cut  across ethnic lines were largely unsuccessful. "}

Traditional Jewish occupations,  such as court financial agent, village moneylender, and  peddler, were undermined by free-market reforms, but  careers in business, the professions, and the arts were  opening to Jewish talent. Many Jews responded energetically  and successfully. Active in finance and railroad building,  European Jews excelled in wholesale and retail trade,  consumer industries, journalism, medicine, and law. By  1871 a majority of Jewish people in western and central  Europe had improved their economic situation and entered  the middle classes. Most Jewish people also identified  strongly with their respective nation-states and with  good reason saw themselves as patriotic citizens. "}

Anti-Semitic beliefs were  particularly popular among conservatives, extremist nationalists,  and people who felt threatened by Jewish competition,  such as small shopkeepers, officeworkers, and  professionals.

The decisive turning point came in 1848, when Jews  formed part of the revolutionary vanguard in Vienna and  Berlin and the Frankfurt Assembly endorsed full rights for  German Jews. Important gains in 1848 survived the conservative  reaction, and throughout the 1850s and 1860s  liberals in Austria, Italy, and Prussia pressed successfully  for legal equality. In 1871 the constitution of the new  German Empire consolidated the process of Jewish emancipation  in central Europe. It abolished all restrictions on  Jewish marriage, choice of occupation, place of residence,  and property ownership. Exclusion from government employment  and discrimination in social relations remained.

In the Russian empire, where there was no Jewish emancipation  and 4 million of Europe’s 7 million Jewish people  lived in 1880, officials used anti-Semitism to channel popular  discontent away from the government and onto the  Jewish minority. Russian Jews were denounced as foreign  exploiters who corrupted national traditions, and in 1881–  1882 a wave of violent pogroms commenced in southern  Russia. The police and the army stood aside for days while  peasants looted and destroyed Jewish property. Official harassment  continued in the following decades, and quotas  were placed on Jewish residency, education, and participation  in the professions. As a result, some Russian Jews  turned toward self-emancipation and the vision of a Zionist  settlement in Palestine. Large numbers also emigrated  to western Europe and the United States.

Socialist parties,  which were generally Marxian parties dedicated to an international  proletarian revolution, grew rapidly in these  years. Did this mean that national states had failed to gain  the support of workers? Certainly, many prosperous and  conservative citizens were greatly troubled by the socialist  movement. And numerous historians have portrayed  the years before 1914 as a time of increasing conflict between  revolutionary socialism, on the one hand, and a  nationalist alliance of the conservative aristocracy and the  prosperous middle class, on the other. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" • Why did the socialist movement grow, and how  revolutionary was it?  The Socialist International "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Socialism appealed to large numbers of workingmen and  workingwomen in the late nineteenth century, and the  growth of socialist parties after 1871 was phenomenal.  (See the feature “Listening to the Past: The Making of a  Socialist on pages 844–845.) Neither Bismarck’s antisocialist  laws nor his extensive social security system checked  the growth of the German Social Democratic Party,  which espoused the Marxian ideology. By 1912 it had  millions of followers and was the largest party in the  Reichstag. Socialist parties also grew in other countries,  though nowhere else with such success. In 1883 Russian  exiles in Switzerland founded the Russian Social Democratic  Party, which grew rapidly after 1890 despite internal  disputes. In France various socialist parties re-emerged in  the 1880s after the carnage of the Paris Commune. They  were finally unified in 1905 in an increasingly powerful  Marxian party called the French Section of the Workers  International. Belgium and Austria-Hungary also had  strong socialist parties. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As the name of the French party suggests, Marxian socialist  parties were eventually linked together in an international  organization. As early as 1848, Marx had laid  out his intellectual system in The Communist Manifesto  (see pages 757–758). He had declared that “the working  men have no country, and he had urged proletarians of  all nations to unite against their governments. Joining  the flood of radicals and republicans who fled continental  Europe for England and America after the unsuccessful  revolutions of 1848, Marx settled in London. Poor  and depressed, he lived on his meager earnings as a journalist  and on the gifts of his friend Friedrich Engels.  Marx never stopped thinking of revolution. Digging  deeply into economics and history, he concluded that  revolution follows economic crisis and tried to prove this  in his greatest theoretical work, Capital (1867). "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The bookish Marx also excelled as a practical organizer.  In 1864 he played an important role in founding  the First International of socialists—the International  Working Men’s Association. In the following years, he  battled successfully to control the organization and used  its annual meetings as a means of spreading his realistic,  “scientific doctrines of inevitable socialist revolution.  Then Marx enthusiastically embraced the passionate,  vaguely radical patriotism of the Paris Commune and its  terrible conflict with the French National Assembly as a "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Theodor Herzl "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In September 1897, only days after his vision and  energy had called into being the First Zionist Congress  in Basel, Switzerland, Theodor Herzl (1860–1904)  assessed the results in his diary: “If I were to sum up  the Congress in a word—which I shall take care not to  publish—it would be this: At Basel I founded the Jewish  state. If I said this out loud today I would be  greeted by universal laughter. In five years perhaps, and  certainly in fifty years, everyone will perceive it.*  Herzl’s buoyant optimism, which so often carried him  forward, was prophetic. Leading the Zionist movement  until his death at age forty-four in 1904, Herzl guided  the first historic steps toward modern Jewish political  nationhood and the creation of Israel in 1948. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Theodor Herzl was born in Budapest, Hungary, into  an upper-middle-class, German-speaking Jewish family.  When Herzl was eighteen, his family moved to Vienna,  where he studied law. As a university student, he soaked  up the liberal beliefs of most well-to-do Viennese Jews,  who also championed the assimilation of German culture.  Wrestling with his nonreligious Jewishness and his  strong pro-German feeling, Herzl embraced German  nationalism and joined a German dueling fraternity.  There he discovered that full acceptance required  openly anti-Semitic attitudes and a repudiation of all  things Jewish. This Herzl could not tolerate, and he  resigned. After receiving his law degree, he embarked  on a literary career. In 1889 Herzl married into a  wealthy Viennese Jewish family, but he and his socialite  wife were mismatched and never happy together. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Herzl achieved considerable success as both a journalist  and a playwright. His witty comedies focused on  the bourgeoisie, including Jewish millionaires trying to  live like aristocrats. Accepting many German stereotypes,  Herzl sometimes depicted eastern Jews as uneducated  and grasping. But as a dedicated, highly educated  liberal, he mainly believed that the Jewish shortcomings  he perceived were the results of age-old persecution  and would disappear through education and  assimilation. Herzl also took a growing pride in Jewish  steadfastness in the face of victimization and suffering.  He savored memories of his early Jewish education and  going with his father to the synagogue. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The emergence of modern anti-Semitism shocked  Herzl, as it did many acculturated Jewish Germans. Moving  to Paris in 1891 as the correspondent for Vienna’s  leading liberal newspaper, Herzl studied politics and  pondered recent historical developments.

He became  an inspiring man of action, rallying the delegates  to the annual Zionist congresses, directing the growth  of the worldwide Zionist organization, and working  himself to death. Herzl also understood that national  consciousness required powerful emotions and symbols,  such as a Jewish flag. Flags build nations, he said,  because people “live and die for a flag.  Putting the Zionist vision before non-Jews and world  public opinion, Herzl believed in international diplomacy  and political agreements. He traveled constantly  to negotiate with European rulers and top officials,  seeking their support in securing territory for a Jewish  state, usually in the Ottoman Empire. Aptly described  by an admiring contemporary as “the first Jewish statesman  since the destruction of Jerusalem, Herzl proved  most successful in Britain.

And as  workers won real, tangible benefits, this furthered the  process. Workers were also not immune to patriotic education  and indoctrination during military service, and  many responded positively to drum-beating parades and  aggressive foreign policy as they loyally voted for socialists.  Nor were workers a unified social group. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Perhaps most important of all, workers’ standard of living  rose gradually but substantially after 1850 as the promise  of the Industrial Revolution was at least partially  realized. In Great Britain, for example, workers could buy  almost twice as much with their wages in 1906 as in 1850,  and most of the increase came after 1870. Workers experienced  similar gradual increases in most continental  countries after 1850, though much less strikingly in late- developing Russia. Improvement in the standard of living  was much more than merely a matter of higher wages. The  quality of life improved dramatically in urban areas. For all  these reasons, workers tended more and more to become  militantly moderate: they demanded gains, but they were  less likely to take to the barricades in pursuit of them. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The growth of labor unions reinforced this trend  toward moderation. In the early stages of industrialization,  modern unions were generally prohibited by law. A  famous law of the French Revolution had declared all  guilds and unions illegal in the name of “liberty in 1791.  In Great Britain, attempts by workers to unite were considered  criminal conspiracies after 1799. Other countries  had similar laws, and these obviously hampered union  development. In France, for example, about two hundred  workers were imprisoned each year between 1825  and 1847 for taking part in illegal combinations. Unions  were considered subversive bodies, only to be hounded  and crushed. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" From this sad position workers struggled to escape.  Great Britain led the way in 1824 and 1825 when unions  won the right to exist but (generally) not the right to  strike. After the collapse of Robert Owen’s attempt to  form one big union in the 1830s (see page 741), new and  more practical kinds of unions appeared. Limited primarily  to highly skilled workers such as machinists and carpenters,  the “new model unions avoided both radical politics and  costly strikes. Instead, their sober, respectable leaders concentrated  on winning better wages and hours for their  members through collective bargaining and compromise.  This approach helped pave the way to full acceptance in  Britain in the 1870s, when unions won the right to strike  without being held legally liable for the financial damage  inflicted on employers. After 1890 unions for unskilled "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Germany was the most industrialized, socialized, and  unionized continental country by 1914. German unions  were not granted important rights until 1869, and until  the antisocialist law was repealed in 1890, they were frequently  harassed by the government as socialist fronts. Nor  were socialist leaders particularly interested in union activity,  believing as they did in the iron law of low wages and  the need for political revolution. The result was that as late  as 1895, there were only about 270,000 union members  in a male industrial workforce of nearly 8 million. Then,  with German industrialization still storming ahead and almost  all legal harassment eliminated, union membership  skyrocketed, reaching roughly 3 million in 1912. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This great expansion both reflected and influenced the  changing character of German unions. Increasingly,  unions in Germany focused on bread-and-butter issues—  wages, hours, working conditions—rather than on the  dissemination of pure socialist doctrine. Genuine collective  bargaining, long opposed by socialist intellectuals as  a “sellout, was officially recognized as desirable by the  German Trade Union Congress in 1899. When employers  proved unwilling to bargain, a series of strikes forced  them to change their minds. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Between 1906 and 1913, successful collective bargaining  gained a prominent place in German industrial relations. In  1913 alone, over ten thousand collective bargaining agreements  affecting 1.25 million workers were signed. Gradual  improvement, not revolution, was becoming the primary  goal of the German trade-union movement. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The German trade unions and their leaders were in fact,  if not in name, thoroughgoing revisionists. Revisionism—  that most awful of sins in the eyes of militant Marxists in  the twentieth century—was an effort by various socialists  to update Marxian doctrines to reflect the realities of the  time. Thus the socialist Edward Bernstein (1850–1932)  argued in 1899 in his Evolutionary Socialism that Marx’s  predictions of ever-greater poverty for workers and ever- greater concentration of wealth in ever-fewer hands had  been proved false. Therefore, Bernstein suggested, socialists  should reform their doctrines and tactics. They should  combine with other progressive forces to win gradual evolutionary  gains for workers through legislation, unions,  and further economic development. These views were denounced  as heresy by the German Social Democratic  Party and later by the entire Second International. Yet the  revisionist, gradualist approach continued to gain the tacit  acceptance of many German socialists, particularly in the  trade unions. "}

I was put in a big room  where sixty women and girls were at work.  Against the windows stood twelve tables, and at  each sat four girls. We had to sort the goods  which had been manufactured, others had to  count them, and a third set had to brand on them  the mark of the firm. We worked from 7 A.M.to  7 P.M.

Moreover, this pattern  of uneven global development became institutionalized, or  built into the structure of the world economy. Thus we  evolved a “lopsided world, a world of rich lands and poor.

{"prompt":"","completion":" In recent years historical economists have begun to  chart the long-term evolution of this gap with some precision.

It compares the long-term evolution of  average income per person in today’s “developed (or industrialized)  regions—defined as Europe, North America,  and Japan—with that found in Africa, Asia, and Latin  America, also often known as the Third World.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Figure 26.1 highlights three main points. First, in  1750 the average standard of living was no higher in Europe  as a whole than in the rest of the world.

{"prompt":"","completion":" The rise of these enormous income disparities, which  are poignant indicators of equal disparities in food and  clothing, health and education, life expectancy and general  material well-being, has generated a great deal of debate.  One school of interpretation stresses that the West used  science, technology, capitalist organization, and even its  critical worldview to create its wealth and greater physical  well-being. Another school argues that the West used its  political and economic power to steal much of its riches,  continuing in the nineteenth (and twentieth) century the  rapacious colonialism born of the era of expansion. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" These issues are complex, and there are few simple answers.  As noted in Chapter 22, the wealth-creating potential  of technological improvement and more intensive  capitalist organization was indeed great. At the same time,  those breakthroughs rested, in part, on Great Britain’s  having already used political force to dominate part of the  world economy by the late eighteenth century. In the  nineteenth century other industrializing countries joined  with Britain to extend Western domination over the entire  world economy. Wealth—unprecedented wealth—was indeed  created, but the lion’s share of that new wealth  flowed to the West and its propertied classes. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \f 849 849  The World Market "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Commerce between nations has always been a powerful  stimulus to economic development. Never was this more  true than in the nineteenth century, when world trade  grew prodigiously. In 1913 the value of world trade was  roughly $38 billion, or about twenty-five times what it had  been in 1800, even though prices of both manufactured  goods and raw materials were lower in 1913 than in  1800. In a general way, the enormous increase in international  commerce summed up the growth of an interlocking  world economy centered in and directed by Europe. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Great Britain played a key role in using trade to tie the  world together economically. In 1815 Britain already had  a colonial empire, for India, Canada, Australia, and other  scattered areas remained British possessions after American  independence. The technological breakthroughs of  the Industrial Revolution allowed Britain to manufacture  cotton textiles, iron, and other goods more cheaply and  to far outstrip domestic demand for such products. Thus  British manufacturers sought export markets first in Europe  and then around the world. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Take the case of cotton textiles. By 1820 Britain was  exporting 50 percent of its production. Europe bought  50 percent of these cotton textile exports, while India  bought only 6 percent. Then as European nations and  the United States erected protective tariff barriers and  promoted domestic industry, British cotton textile manufacturers  aggressively sought and found other foreign  markets in non-Western areas. By 1850 India was buying  25 percent and Europe only 16 percent of a much larger  total. As a British colony, India could not raise tariffs to  protect its ancient cotton textile industry, and thousands  of Indian weavers lost their livelihoods. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" After the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846 (see page  764), Britain became the world’s single best market. Until  1914 Britain remained the world’s emporium, where  not only agricultural products and raw materials but  also manufactured goods entered freely. Free access to  Britain’s market stimulated the development of mines  and plantations in many non-Western areas. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The growth of trade was facilitated by the conquest of  distance. The earliest railroad construction occurred in  Europe (including Russia) and in America north of the Rio  Grande; other parts of the globe saw the building of rail  lines after 1860. By 1920 more than one-quarter of the  world’s railroads were in Latin America, Asia, Africa, and  Australia.

Thus railroads  dovetailed admirably with Western economic interests,  facilitating the inflow and sale of Western manufactured  goods and the export and the development of local  raw materials. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The power of steam revolutionized transportation by  sea as well as by land. Steam power, long used to drive paddle  wheelers on rivers, particularly in Russia and North  America, finally began to supplant sails on the oceans of  the world in the late 1860s. Lighter, stronger, cheaper  steel replaced iron, which had replaced wood. Screw propellers  superseded paddle wheels, while mighty compound  steam engines cut fuel consumption by half. Passenger and  freight rates tumbled, and the intercontinental shipment  of low-priced raw materials became feasible. "}

In  Buenos Aires it loaded wheat for Calcutta, and in Calcutta  it took on jute for New York.

By  the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Europeans had  invested more than $40 billion abroad. Great Britain,  France, and Germany were the principal investing countries  (see Map 26.1). The great gap between rich and poor  within Europe meant that the wealthy and moderately  well-to-do could and did send great sums abroad in  search of interest and dividends. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Most of the capital exported did not go to European  colonies or protectorates in Asia and Africa. About three- quarters of total European investment went to other  European countries, the United States and Canada, Australia  and New Zealand, and Latin America. Europe found  its most profitable opportunities for investment in construction  of the railroads, ports, and utilities that were necessary  to settle and develop the almost-vacant lands in such  places as Australia and the Americas. By lending money for  a foreign railroad, Europeans also enabled white settlers to  buy European rails and locomotives and developed sources  of cheap food and raw materials. Much of this investment  was peaceful and mutually beneficial for lenders and borrowers.  The victims were Native American Indians and  Australian aborigines, who were decimated by the diseases,  liquor, and weapons of an aggressively expanding  Western society. "}

Yet Europe’s economic and cultural penetration of  old, densely populated civilizations was also profoundly significant,  especially for the non-European peoples affected  by it. With such civilizations Europeans also increased their  trade and profit, and they were prepared to use force, if  necessary, to attain their desires. This was what happened  in China and Japan, two crucial examples of the general  pattern of intrusion into non-Western lands. "}

For years the little community of foreign merchants in  Canton had to accept the Chinese system. By the 1820s,  however, the dominant group, the British, were flexing  their muscles. Moreover, in the smoking of opium—that  “destructive and ensnaring vice denounced by Chinese  decrees—they had found something the Chinese really  wanted. Grown legally in British-occupied India, opium  was smuggled into China by means of fast ships and bribed  officials. By 1836 the aggressive goal of the British merchants  in Canton was an independent British colony in  China and “safe and unrestricted liberty in trade. Spurred  on by economic motives, they pressured the British government  to take decisive action and enlisted the support of  British manufacturers with visions of vast Chinese markets  to be opened.  At the same time, the Qing government decided that the  opium trade had to be stamped out. It was ruining the  people and stripping the empire of its silver, which was  going to British merchants to pay for the opium. The  government began to prosecute Chinese drug dealers vigorously  and in 1839 it ordered the foreign merchants to  obey China’s laws. The British merchants refused and were  expelled, whereupon war soon broke out.  Using troops from India and being in control of the  seas, the British occupied several coastal cities and forced  China to surrender.

Another round of harsh treaties  gave European merchants and missionaries greater privileges  and protection and forced the Chinese to accept  trade and investment on unfavorable terms for several  more cities.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Western Penetration of Egypt "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Egypt’s experience illustrates not only the explosive  power of the expanding European economy and society  but also their seductive appeal in non-Western lands. European  involvement in Egypt also led to a new model of  formal political control, which European powers applied  widely in Africa and Asia after 1882. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Of great importance in African and Middle Eastern history,  the ancient land of the pharaohs had since 525 B.C.  been ruled by a succession of foreigners, most recently by  the Ottoman Turks. In 1798 French armies under young  General Napoleon Bonaparte invaded the Egyptian part  of the Ottoman Empire and occupied the territory for  three years. Into the power vacuum left by the French  withdrawal stepped an extraordinary Albanian-born Turkish  general, Muhammad Ali (1769–1849). "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" First appointed governor of Egypt by the Turkish sultan,  Muhammad Ali set out to build his own state on the  strength of a large, powerful army organized along European  lines. He drafted for the first time the illiterate, despised  peasant masses of Egypt, and he hired French and  Italian army officers to train these raw recruits and their  Turkish officers. The government was also reformed, new  lands were cultivated, and communications were improved.  By the time of his death in 1849, Muhammad Ali had established  a strong and virtually independent Egyptian  state, to be ruled by his family on a hereditary basis within  the Turkish empire. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Muhammad Ali’s policies of modernization attracted  large numbers of Europeans to the banks of the Nile.  The port city of Alexandria had more than fifty thousand "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 853  Europeans by 1864. Europeans served not only as army  officers but also as engineers, doctors, government officials,  and police officers. Others turned to trade, finance,  and shipping. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" To pay for his ambitious plans, Muhammad Ali encouraged  the development of commercial agriculture.  This development had profound implications. Egyptian  peasants were poor but largely self-sufficient, growing  food for their own consumption on state-owned lands allotted  to them by tradition. Faced with the possibility of  export agriculture, high-ranking officials and members of  Muhammad Ali’s family began carving large private landholdings  out of the state domain. The new landlords  made the peasants their tenants and forced them to grow  cash crops geared to European markets. Thus Egyptian  landowners “modernized agriculture, but to the detriment  of peasant well-being. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" These trends continued under Muhammad Ali’s grandson  Ismail, who in 1863 began his sixteen-year rule as  Egypt’s khedive, or prince. Educated at France’s leading  military academy, Ismail was a westernizing autocrat.  The large irrigation networks he promoted caused cotton  production and exports to Europe to boom, and  with his support the Suez Canal was completed by a  French company in 1869. The Arabic of the masses replaced  the Turkish of the conquerors as the official language.  Young Egyptians educated in Europe spread new  skills, and Cairo acquired modern boulevards and Western  hotels. As Ismail proudly declared, “My country is no  longer in Africa, we now form part of Europe.2 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Yet Ismail was too impatient and reckless. His projects  were enormously expensive, and by 1876 Egypt owed  foreign bondholders a colossal debt that it could not pay.  Rather than let Egypt go bankrupt and repudiate its  loans, the governments of France and Great Britain intervened  politically to protect the European bondholders.  They forced Ismail to appoint French and British commissioners  to oversee Egyptian finances so that the Egyptian  debt would be paid in full. This momentous decision  implied direct European political control and was a sharp  break with the previous pattern of trade and investment.  Throughout most of the nineteenth century, Europeans  had used military might and political force primarily to  make sure that non-Western lands would accept European  trade and investment. Now Europeans were going  to determine the state budget and effectively rule Egypt. "}

The British said their occupation was temporary, but  British armies remained in Egypt until 1956. They maintained  the façade of the khedive’s government as an autonomous  province of the Ottoman Empire, but the  khedive was a mere puppet. British rule did result in tax  reforms and somewhat better conditions for peasants,  while foreign bondholders received their interest and  Egyptian nationalists nursed their injured pride. "}

As in the eighteenth century, the rapid  increase in numbers put pressure on the land and led to  land hunger and relative overpopulation in area after  area. In most countries, migration increased twenty years  after a rapid growth in population, as many children of  the baby boom grew up, saw little available land and few  opportunities, and migrated. This pattern was especially  prevalent when rapid population increase predated extensive  industrial development, which offered the best  long-term hope of creating jobs within the country and  reducing poverty. Thus millions of country folk went  abroad as well as to nearby cities in search of work and  economic opportunity. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Before looking at the people who migrated, let us consider  three facts. First, the number of men and women  who left Europe increased rapidly before World War I. As  Figure 26.3 shows, more than 11 million left in the first  decade of the twentieth century, over five times the number  departing in the 1850s.

It grew irregularly after  about 1830, reaching a first peak in the early 1850s  and another in the early 1880s. Thereafter it declined rapidly,  for Germany’s rapid industrialization was providing  adequate jobs at home. This pattern contrasted sharply  with that of Italy.

The European migrant was most  often a small peasant landowner or a village craftsman  whose traditional way of life was threatened by too little  land, estate agriculture, and cheap, factory-made goods.  German peasants who left the Rhineland and southwestern  Germany between 1830 and 1854, for example, felt  trapped by what Friedrich List called the “dwarf economy,  with its tiny landholdings and declining craft industries.  Selling out and moving to buy much cheaper  land in the American Midwest became a common response.

Britain, France, Germany, and Italy scrambled for  African possessions as if their national livelihoods depended  on it (see Map 26.2). By 1900 nearly the whole continent  had been carved up and placed under European rule: only  Ethiopia in northeast Africa, which repulsed Italian invaders,  and Liberia on the West African coast, which had  been settled by freed slaves from the United States, remained  independent.

The British,  led by Cecil Rhodes in the Cape Colony, leapfrogged  over the Afrikaner states in the early 1890s and established  protectorates over Bechuanaland (now Botswana)  and Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe and Zambia), named in  honor of its freelance imperial founder. Trying unsuccessfully  to undermine the stubborn Afrikaners in the  Transvaal, where English-speaking capitalists like Rhodes  were developing fabulously rich gold mines, the British  conquered their white rivals in the bloody South African  War (1899–1902). In 1910 their territories were united  with the old Cape Colony and the eastern province of  Natal in a new Union of South Africa, established—  unlike any other territory in Africa—as a largely “selfgoverning  colony. This enabled the defeated Afrikaners  to use their numerical superiority over the British settlers  to gradually take political power, as even the most "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" (r. 1865–1909), an energetic, strong-willed monarch with  a lust for distant territory. “The sea bathes our coast, the  world lies before us, he had exclaimed in 1861. “Steam  and electricity have annihilated distance, and all the non- appropriated lands on the surface of the globe can become  the field of our operations and of our success.4 By 1876  Leopold was focusing on central Africa. Subsequently, he  formed a financial syndicate under his personal control to  send Henry M. Stanley, a sensation-seeking journalist and  part-time explorer, to the Congo basin. Stanley was able  to establish trading stations, sign “treaties with African  chiefs, and plant Leopold’s flag. Leopold’s actions alarmed  the French, who quickly sent out an expedition under  Pierre de Brazza. In 1880 de Brazza signed a treaty of protection  with the chief of the large Teke tribe and began to  establish a French protectorate on the north bank of the  Congo River.  Leopold’s buccaneering intrusion into the Congo area  raised the question of the political fate of Africa. By 1882  Europe had caught “African fever. There was a gold  rush mentality, and the race for territory was on. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" To lay down some basic rules for this new and dangerous  game of imperialist competition in sub-Saharan  Africa, Jules Ferry of France and Otto von Bismarck of  Germany arranged an international conference on Africa  in Berlin in 1884 and 1885. The conference established  the principle that European claims to African territory had  to rest on “effective occupation in order to be recognized  by other states. This meant that Europeans would  push relentlessly into interior regions from all sides and  that no single European power would be able to claim the  entire continent. The conference recognized Leopold’s  personal rule over a neutral Congo free state and agreed  to work to stop slavery and the slave trade in Africa. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Berlin conference coincided with Germany’s sudden  emergence as an imperial power. Prior to about  1880, Bismarck, like many other European leaders at the  time, had seen little value in colonies. Colonies reminded  him, he said, of a poor but proud nobleman who wore a  fur coat when he could not afford a shirt underneath.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Meanwhile, the British began enlarging their West African  enclaves and impatiently pushing northward from the  Cape Colony and westward from Zanzibar. Their thrust  southward from Egypt was blocked in Sudan by fiercely  independent Muslims who massacred a British force at  Khartoum in 1885. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A decade later, another British force, under General  Horatio H. Kitchener, moved cautiously and more successfully  up the Nile River, building a railroad to supply  arms and reinforcements as it went. Finally, in 1898 these  British troops met their foe at Omdurman (see Map 26.2),  where Muslim tribesmen armed with spears charged time  and time again, only to be cut down by the recently invented  machine gun. For one smug participant, the young  British officer Winston Churchill, it was “like a pantomime  scene in a play. “These extraordinary foreign  figures . . . march up one by one from the darkness of  Barbarism to the footlights of civilization . . . and their  conquerors, taking their possessions, forget even their  names. For another, more somber English observer,  “It was not a battle but an execution. The bodies were  not in heaps . . . but they spread evenly over acres and  acres.5 In the end, eleven thousand brave Muslim  tribesmen lay dead, while only twenty-eight Britons had  been killed. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Continuing up the Nile after the Battle of Omdurman,  Kitchener’s armies found that a small French force had  already occupied the village of Fashoda. Locked in imperial  competition with Britain ever since the British occupation  of Egypt, France had tried to beat the British to  one of Africa’s last unclaimed areas—the upper reaches of  the Nile. The result was a serious diplomatic crisis and  even the threat of war. Eventually, wracked by the Dreyfus  affair (see page 834) and unwilling to fight, France  backed down and withdrew its forces, allowing the  British to take over. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Rhodes came from a large middle-class family and  at seventeen went to southern Africa to seek his fortune.  He soon turned to diamonds, newly discovered at  Kimberley, picked good partners, and was wealthy by  1876. But Rhodes, often called a dreamer, wanted more.  He entered Oxford University, while returning periodically  to Africa, and his musings crystallized in a belief in  progress through racial competition and territorial expansion.  “I contend, he wrote, “that we [English] are  the finest race in the world and the more of the world we  inhabit the better it is for the human race.* "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Rhodes’s belief in British expansion never wavered.  In 1880 he formed the De Beers Mining Company, and  by 1888 his firm monopolized southern Africa’s diamond  production and earned fabulous profits. Rhodes  also entered the Cape Colony’s legislature and became  the all-powerful prime minister from 1890 to 1896.  His main objective was to dominate the Afrikaner  republics and to impose British rule on as much land as  possible beyond their northern borders. Working  through a state-approved private company financed in  part by De Beers, Rhodes’s agents forced and cajoled  African kings to accept British “protection, then put  down rebellions with Maxim machine guns. Britain  thus obtained a great swath of empire on the cheap. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But Rhodes, like many high achievers obsessed with  power and personal aggrandizement, went too far. He  backed, and then in 1896 declined to call back, a failed  invasion of the Transvaal, which was designed to topple  the Dutch-speaking republic. Repudiated by top British  leaders who had encouraged his plan, Rhodes had to  resign as prime minister. In declining health, he continued  to agitate against the Afrikaner republics. He died at age  forty-nine as the South African War (1899–1902) ended. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Rhodes cared nothing for the rights of blacks. Ever a  combination of visionary and opportunist, he looked  forward to an eventual reconciliation of Afrikaners and  British in a united white front. Therefore, as prime  minister of the Cape Colony, he broke with the colony’s  liberal tradition and supported Afrikaner demands to  reduce drastically the number of black voters and limit  black freedoms. This helped lay the foundation for the  Union of South Africa’s brutal policy of racial segregation  known as apartheid after 1948. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Although the sudden division of Africa was more spectacular,  Europeans also extended their political control in  Asia. In 1815 the Dutch ruled little more than the island  of Java in the East Indies. Thereafter they gradually  brought almost all of the three-thousand-mile archipelago  under their political authority, though—in good imperialist  fashion—they had to share some of the spoils  with Britain and Germany. In the critical decade of the  1880s, the French under the leadership of Ferry took Indochina.  India, Japan, and China also experienced a profound  imperialist impact (see Map 26.3). "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Two other great imperialist powers, Russia and the  United States, also acquired rich territories in Asia. Russia  moved steadily forward on two fronts throughout the  nineteenth century. Russians conquered Muslim areas to  the south in the Caucasus and in Central Asia and also proceeded  to nibble greedily on China’s outlying provinces in  the Far East, especially in the 1890s. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The United States’s great conquest was the Philippines,  taken from Spain in 1898 after the Spanish-American  War. When it quickly became clear that the United States  had no intention of granting independence, Philippine  patriots rose in revolt and were suppressed only after long,  bitter fighting. Some Americans protested the taking of  the Philippines, but to no avail. Thus another great Western  power joined the imperialist ranks in Asia. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Many factors contributed to the late-nineteenth-century  rush for territory and empire, which was in turn one aspect  of Western society’s generalized expansion in the  age of industry and nationalism. It is little wonder that  controversies have raged over interpretation of the new  imperialism, especially since authors of every persuasion  have often exaggerated particular aspects in an attempt to  prove their own theories. Yet despite complexity and  controversy, basic causes are clearly identifiable. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Economic motives played an important role in the extension  of political empires, especially the British Empire.  By the late 1870s, France, Germany, and the United  States were industrializing rapidly behind rising tariff  barriers. Great Britain was losing its early lead and facing  increasingly tough competition in foreign markets. In  this new economic situation, Britain came to value old  possessions, especially its vast colony of India, which it "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 865  had exploited most profitably for more than a century.  When continental powers began to grab territory in the  1880s, the British followed suit immediately. They feared  that France and Germany would seal off their empires  with high tariffs and restrictions and that future economic  opportunities would be lost forever. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Actually, the overall economic gains of the new imperialism  proved quite limited before 1914. The new  colonies were simply too poor to buy much, and they offered  few immediately profitable investments. Nonetheless,  even the poorest, most barren desert was jealously  prized, and no territory was ever abandoned. Colonies  became important for political and diplomatic reasons.  Each leading country saw colonies as crucial to national  security, military power, and international prestige. For  instance, safeguarding the Suez Canal played a key role in  the British occupation of Egypt, and protecting Egypt in  turn led to the bloody conquest of Sudan. Far-flung possessions  guaranteed ever-growing navies the safe havens  and the dependable coaling stations they needed in time  of crisis or war. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Many people were convinced that colonies were essential  to great nations. “There has never been a great  power without great colonies, wrote one French publicist  in 1877. “Every virile people has established colonial  power, echoed the famous nationalist historian of Germany,  Heinrich von Treitschke. “All great nations in the  fullness of their strength have desired to set their mark  upon barbarian lands and those who fail to participate in  this great rivalry will play a pitiable role in time to come.6 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Treitschke’s harsh statement reflects not only the  increasing aggressiveness of European nationalism after  Bismarck’s wars of German unification but also Social  Darwinian theories of brutal competition among races. As  one prominent English economist argued, the “strongest  nation has always been conquering the weaker...and  the strongest tend to be best. Thus European nations,  which were seen as racially distinct parts of the dominant  white race, had to seize colonies to show they were strong  and virile. Moreover, since racial struggle was nature’s inescapable  law, the conquest of “inferior peoples was just.  “The path of progress is strewn with the wreck . . . of inferior  races, wrote one professor in 1900. “Yet these  dead peoples are, in very truth, the stepping stones on  which mankind has risen to the higher intellectual and  deeper emotional life of today.7 Social Darwinism and  harsh racial doctrines fostered imperialist expansion.

Second, newly discovered quinine  proved no less effective in controlling attacks of  malaria, which had previously decimated whites in the  tropics whenever they left breezy coastal enclaves and  dared to venture into mosquito-infested interiors. Third,  the combination of the steamship and the international  telegraph permitted Western powers to quickly concentrate  their firepower in a given area when it was needed.  Never before—and never again after 1914—would the  technological gap between the West and non-Western regions  of the world be so great. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Social tensions and domestic political conflicts also  contributed mightily to overseas expansion. In Germany,  in Russia, and in other countries to a lesser extent, contemporary  critics of imperialism charged conservative political  leaders with manipulating colonial issues in order  to divert popular attention from the class struggle at  home and to create a false sense of national unity. Thus "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" imperial propagandists relentlessly stressed that colonies  benefited workers as well as capitalists, providing jobs  and cheap raw materials that raised workers’ standard of  living.

In short, conservative leaders defined imperialist  development as a national necessity, which they used  to justify the status quo and their hold on power. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Finally, certain special-interest groups in each country  were powerful agents of expansion. Shipping companies  wanted lucrative subsidies. White settlers demanded more  land and greater protection. Missionaries and humanitarians  wanted to spread religion and stop the slave trade.  Military men and colonial officials, whose role has often  been overlooked, foresaw rapid advancement and high- paid positions in growing empires. The actions of such  groups pushed the course of empire forward. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Western society did not rest the case for empire solely on  naked conquest and a Darwinian racial struggle or on  power politics and the need for naval bases on every ocean.  Imperialists developed additional arguments in order to  satisfy their consciences and answer their critics. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A favorite idea was that Europeans could and should  “civilize more primitive, nonwhite peoples. According  to this view, nonwhites would eventually receive the benefits  of modern economies, cities, advanced medicine,  and higher standards of living. In time, they might be  ready for self-government and Western democracy. Thus  the French spoke of their sacred “civilizing mission. In  1899 Rudyard Kipling (1865–1936), who wrote masterfully  of Anglo-Indian life and was perhaps the most influential  British writer of the 1890s, exhorted Europeans  (and Americans in the United States) to unselfish service  in distant lands: "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Many Americans accepted the ideology of the white  man’s burden. It was an important factor in the decision  to rule, rather than liberate, the Philippines after  the Spanish-American War. Like their European counterparts,  these Americans sincerely believed that their  civilization had reached unprecedented heights and that  they had unique benefits to bestow on all “less advanced  peoples. Another argument was that imperial government  protected natives from tribal warfare as well as  cruder forms of exploitation by white settlers and business  people. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Peace and stability under European control also facilitated  the spread of Christianity. In Africa Catholic and  Protestant missionaries competed with Islam south of the  Sahara, seeking converts and building schools to spread  the Gospel.

{"prompt":"","completion":" J. A. Hobson (1858–1940) in his Imperialism, a work  that influenced Lenin and others. Hobson contended  that the rush to acquire colonies was due to the economic  needs of unregulated capitalism, particularly the  need of the rich to find outlets for their surplus capital.  Yet, Hobson argued, imperial possessions did not pay off  economically for the country as a whole. Only unscrupulous  special-interest groups profited from them, at the  expense of both the European taxpayer and the natives.  Moreover, Hobson argued that the quest for empire diverted  popular attention away from domestic reform and  the need to reduce the great gap between rich and poor.  These and similar arguments were not very persuasive,  however. Most people then (and now) were sold on the  idea that imperialism was economically profitable for the  homeland, and a broad and genuine enthusiasm for empire  developed among the masses.  Hobson and many other critics struck home, however,  with their moral condemnation of whites imperiously ruling  nonwhites. They rebelled against crude Social Darwinian  thought. “O Evolution, what crimes are committed in  thy name! cried one foe. Another sardonically coined a  new beatitude: “Blessed are the strong, for they shall prey  on the weak.10 Kipling and his kind were lampooned as  racist bullies whose rule rested on brutality, racial contempt,  and the Maxim machine gun.

In their empires, Europeans  imposed military dictatorships on Africans and Asians;  forced them to work involuntarily, almost like slaves; and  discriminated against them shamelessly. Only by renouncing  imperialism, its critics insisted, and giving captive  peoples the freedoms Western society had struggled for  since the French Revolution would Europeans be worthy  of their traditions. Europeans who denounced the imperialist  tide provided colonial peoples with a Western ideology  of liberation. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" To peoples in Africa and Asia, Western expansion represented  a profoundly disruptive assault. Everywhere it threatened  traditional ruling classes, traditional economies,  and traditional ways of life. Christian missionaries and  European secular ideologies challenged established beliefs  and values. Non-Western peoples experienced a crisis  of identity, one made all the more painful by the  power and arrogance of the white intruders. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" • What was the general pattern of non-Western responses  to Western expansion, and how did India, Japan, and China  meet the imperialist challenge?  The Pattern of Response "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Generally, the initial response of African and Asian rulers  to aggressive Western expansion was to try to drive the  unwelcome foreigners away. This was the case in China,  Japan, and upper Sudan, as we have seen. Violent anti- foreign reactions exploded elsewhere again and again, but  the superior military technology of the industrialized West  almost invariably prevailed. Beaten in battle, many Africans  and Asians concentrated on preserving their cultural traditions  at all costs. Others found themselves forced to reconsider  their initial hostility. Some (such as Ismail of Egypt)  concluded that the West was indeed superior in some ways  and that it was therefore necessary to reform their societies  and copy some European achievements, especially if they  wished to escape full-blown Western political rule. Thus it  is possible to think of responses to the Western impact as a  spectrum, with “traditionalists at one end, “westernizers  or “modernizers at the other, and many shades of opinion  in between. Both before and after European domination,  the struggle among these groups was often intense. With "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" time, however, the modernizers tended to gain the upper  hand. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When the power of both the traditionalists and the  modernizers was thoroughly shattered by superior force,  the great majority of Asians and Africans accepted imperial  rule. Political participation in non-Western lands was  historically limited to small elites, and the masses were  used to doing what their rulers told them. In these circumstances  Europeans, clothed in power and convinced of their  righteousness, governed smoothly and effectively. They  received considerable support from both traditionalists (local  chiefs, landowners, religious leaders) and modernizers  (Western-educated professional classes and civil servants). "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Nevertheless, imperial rule was in many ways an imposing  edifice built on sand. Support for European rule  among the conforming and accepting millions was shallow  and weak. Thus the conforming masses followed  with greater or lesser enthusiasm a few determined personalities  who came to oppose the Europeans. Such leaders  always arose, both when Europeans ruled directly and  when they manipulated native governments, for at least  two basic reasons. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" First, the nonconformists—the eventual anti-imperialist  leaders—developed a burning desire for human dignity.  They came to feel that such dignity was incompatible with  foreign rule. Second, potential leaders found in the Western  world the ideologies and justification for their protest.  They discovered liberalism, with its credo of civil liberty  and political self-determination. They echoed the demands  of anti-imperialists in Europe and America that the  West live up to its own ideals. Above all, they found themselves  attracted to modern nationalism, which asserted  that every people had the right to control its own destiny.  After 1917 anti-imperialist revolt would find another  weapon in Lenin’s version of Marxian socialism. Thus the  anti-imperialist search for dignity drew strength from Western  thought and culture, as is apparent in the development  of three major Asian countries—India, Japan, and China. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" India was the jewel of the British Empire, and no colonial  area experienced a more profound British impact. Unlike  Japan and China, which maintained a real or precarious  independence, and unlike African territories, which were  annexed by Europeans only at the end of the nineteenth  century, India was ruled more or less absolutely by Britain  for a very long time.

Yet it practiced strict job discrimination  and social segregation, and most of its members quite  frankly considered the jumble of Indian peoples and castes  to be racially inferior. As Lord Kitchener, one of the most  distinguished top military commanders in India, stated: "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" It is this consciousness of the inherent superiority of the European  which has won for us India. However well educated  and clever a native may be, and however brave he may prove  himself, I believe that no rank we can bestow on him would  cause him to be considered an equal of the British officer.12 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" British women played an important part in the imperial  enterprise, especially after the opening of the Suez  Canal in 1869 made it much easier for civil servants and  businessmen to bring their wives and children with them  to India. These British families tended to live in their  own separate communities, where they occupied large  houses with well-shaded porches, handsome lawns, and  a multitude of servants. It was the wife’s responsibility  to manage this complex household. Many officials’ wives  learned to relish their duties, and they directed their households  and servants with the same self-confident authoritarianism  that characterized British political rule in India.  (See the feature “Listening to the Past: A British Woman  in India on pages 876–877.) "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A small minority of British women—many of them  feminists, social reformers, or missionaries, both married  and single—sought to go further and shoulder the “white  women’s burden in India, as one historian has described  it.13 These women tried especially to improve the lives of  Indian women, both Hindu and Muslim, and to move  them closer through education and legislation to the better  conditions that they believed Western women had attained.  Their greatest success was educating some elite  Hindu women who took up the cause of reform. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" With British men and women sharing a sense of mission  as well as strong feelings of racial and cultural superiority,  the British acted energetically and introduced many desirable  changes to India. Realizing that they needed well- educated Indians to serve as skilled subordinates in the  government and army, the British established a modern  system of progressive secondary education in which all instruction  was in English. Thus through education and government  service, the British offered some Indians excellent  opportunities for both economic and social advancement.  High-caste Hindus, particularly quick to respond, emerged  as skillful intermediaries between the British rulers and the  Indian people, and soon they formed a new elite profoundly  influenced by Western thought and culture. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This new bureaucratic elite played a crucial role in "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" modern economic development, which was a second result  of British rule. Irrigation projects for agriculture, the  world’s third-largest railroad network for good communications,  and large tea and jute plantations geared to the  world economy were all developed. Unfortunately, the  lot of the Indian masses improved little, for the increase  in production was eaten up by population increase. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Finally, with a well-educated, English-speaking Indian  bureaucracy and modern communications, the British  created a unified, powerful state. They placed under the  same general system of law and administration the different  Hindu and Muslim peoples and the vanquished kingdoms  of the entire subcontinent—groups that had fought  each other for centuries and had been repeatedly conquered  by Muslim and Mongol invaders. It was as if Europe,  with its many states and varieties of Christianity,  had been conquered and united in a single great empire. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In spite of these achievements, the decisive reaction  to European rule was the rise of nationalism among the  Indian elite. No matter how anglicized and necessary a  member of the educated classes became, he or she could  never become the white ruler’s equal. The top jobs, the  best clubs, the modern hotels, and even certain railroad  compartments were sealed off to brown-skinned Indians.  The peasant masses might accept such inequality as the  latest version of age-old oppression, but the well-educated,  English-speaking elite eventually could not. For the elite,  racial discrimination meant injured pride and bitter injustice.  It flagrantly contradicted those cherished Western  concepts of human rights and equality. Moreover, it was  based on dictatorship, no matter how benign. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" By 1885, when educated Indians came together to  found the predominately Hindu Indian National Congress,  demands were increasing for the equality and self- government that Britain had already granted white-settler  colonies, such as Canada and Australia. By 1907, emboldened  in part by Japan’s success (see the next section), the  radicals in the Indian National Congress were calling for  complete independence. Even the moderates were demanding  home rule for India through an elected parliament.  Although there were sharp divisions between  Hindus and Muslims, Indians were finding an answer to  the foreign challenge. The common heritage of British  rule and Western ideals, along with the reform and revitalization  of the Hindu religion, had created a genuine  movement for national independence. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When Commodore Matthew Perry arrived in Japan in  1853 with his crude but effective gunboat diplomacy, "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \f 871 871  Japan was a complex feudal society. At the top stood a figurehead  emperor, but real power was in the hands of a  hereditary military governor, the shogun. With the help  of a warrior nobility known as samurai, the shogun governed  a country of hard-working, productive peasants and  city dwellers. Often poor and restless, the intensely proud  samurai were humiliated by the sudden American intrusion  and the unequal treaties with Western countries. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When foreign diplomats and merchants began to settle  in Yokohama, radical samurai reacted with a wave of antiforeign  terrorism and antigovernment assassinations  between 1858 and 1863. The imperialist response was  swift and unambiguous. An allied fleet of American, British,  Dutch, and French warships demolished key forts, further  weakening the power and prestige of the shogun’s  government. Then in 1867, a coalition led by patriotic  samurai seized control of the government with hardly  any bloodshed and restored the political power of the  emperor. This was the Meiji Restoration, a great turning  point in Japanese development. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In 1871 the new leaders abolished the old feudal structure  of aristocratic, decentralized government and formed  a strong unified state. Following the example of the French  Revolution, they dismantled the four-class legal system  and declared social equality. They decreed freedom of  movement in a country where traveling abroad had been  a most serious crime. They created a free, competitive,  government-stimulated economy. Japan began to build  railroads and modern factories. Thus the new generation  adopted many principles of a free, liberal society, and, as in  Europe, such freedom resulted in a tremendously creative  release of human energy. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Yet the overriding concern of Japan’s political leadership  was always a powerful state, and to achieve this, more  than liberalism was borrowed from the West. A powerful  modern navy was created, and the army was completely  reorganized along European lines, with three-year military  service for all males and a professional officer corps. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Responding to Western Imperialism • "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The immediate, all-important goal of the new government  was to meet the foreign threat. The battle cry of the  Meiji reformers was “Enrich the state and strengthen the  armed forces. Yet how were these tasks to be done? In  an about-face that was one of history’s most remarkable  chapters, the young but well-trained, idealistic but flexible  leaders of Meiji Japan dropped their antiforeign attacks.  Convinced that Western civilization was indeed superior  in its military and industrial aspects, they initiated from  above a series of measures to reform Japan along modern  lines. In the broadest sense, the Meiji leaders tried to harness  the power inherent in Europe’s dual revolution in order  to protect their country and catch up with the West. "}

Following  the model of the German Empire, Japan established an  authoritarian constitution and rejected democracy. The  power of the emperor and his ministers was vast, that of  the legislature limited. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Japan successfully copied the imperialism of Western  society. Expansion not only proved that Japan was strong;  it also cemented the nation together in a great mission.  Having “opened Korea with the gunboat diplomacy of  imperialism in 1876, Japan decisively defeated China in a  war over Korea in 1894 and 1895 and took Formosa  (modern-day Taiwan). In the next years, Japan competed  aggressively with the leading European powers for influence  and territory in China, particularly Manchuria. There  Japanese and Russian imperialism met and collided. In  1904 Japan attacked Russia without warning, and after a  bloody war, Japan emerged with a valuable foothold in  China, Russia’s former protectorate over Port Arthur (see  Map 26.3). By 1910, with the annexation of Korea, Japan  had become a major imperialist power. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Japan became the first non-Western country to use an  ancient love of country to transform itself and thereby  meet the many-sided challenge of Western expansion.  Moreover, Japan demonstrated convincingly that a modern  Asian nation could defeat and humble a great Western  power. Many Chinese nationalists were fascinated by  Japan’s achievement. A group of patriots in French-ruled  southern Vietnam sent Vietnamese students to Japan to  learn the island empire’s secret of success. Japan provided  patriots throughout Asia and Africa with an inspiring example  of national recovery and liberation. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Toward Revolution in China "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In 1860 the two-hundred-year-old Qing Dynasty in China  appeared on the verge of collapse. Efforts to repel foreigners  had failed, and rebellion and chaos wracked the country.  Yet the government drew on its traditional strengths  and made a surprising comeback that lasted more than  thirty years. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Two factors were crucial in this reversal. First, the traditional  ruling groups temporarily produced new and effective  leadership. Loyal scholar-statesmen and generals  quelled disturbances such as the great Tai Ping rebellion.  The empress dowager Tzu Hsi, a truly remarkable woman,  governed in the name of her young son and combined  shrewd insight with vigorous action to revitalize the  bureaucracy. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Second, destructive foreign aggression lessened, for the  Europeans had obtained their primary goal of commercial  and diplomatic relations. Indeed, some Europeans  contributed to the dynasty’s recovery. A talented Irishman  effectively reorganized China’s customs office and  increased the government tax receipts, while a sympathetic  American diplomat represented China in foreign  lands and helped strengthen the central government.  Such efforts dovetailed with the dynasty’s efforts to adopt  some aspects of Western government and technology  while maintaining traditional Chinese values and beliefs. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The parallel movement toward domestic reform and  limited cooperation with the West collapsed under the  blows of Japanese imperialism. The Sino-Japanese War of  1894 to 1895 and the subsequent harsh peace treaty revealed  China’s helplessness in the face of aggression, triggering  a rush for foreign concessions and protectorates in  China. At the high point of this rush in 1898, it appeared  that the European powers might actually divide China  among themselves, as they had recently divided Africa.  Probably only the jealousy each nation felt toward its imperialist  competitors saved China from partition, although  the U.S. Open Door policy, which opposed formal annexation  of Chinese territory, may have helped tip the balance.  In any event, the tempo of foreign encroachment greatly  accelerated after 1894. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" So, too, did the intensity and radicalism of the Chinese  reaction. Like the leaders of the Meiji Restoration, some  modernizers saw salvation in Western institutions. In 1898  the government launched a desperate hundred days of  reform in an attempt to meet the foreign challenge. More  radical reformers, such as the revolutionary Sun Yat-sen  (1866–1925), who came from the peasantry and was educated  in Hawaii by Christian missionaries, sought to overthrow  the dynasty altogether and establish a republic. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" On the other side, some traditionalists turned back  toward ancient practices, political conservatism, and fanatical  hatred of the “foreign devils. “Protect the country,  destroy the foreigner was their simple motto. Such conservative,  antiforeign patriots had often clashed with foreign  missionaries, whom they charged with undermining  reverence for ancestors and thereby threatening the Chinese  family and the entire society. In the agony of defeat  and unwanted reforms, secret societies such as the Boxers  rebelled. In northeastern China, more than two hundred  foreign missionaries and several thousand Chinese Christians  were killed. Once again the imperialist response was  swift and harsh. Peking was occupied and plundered by  foreign armies. A heavy indemnity was imposed. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" In the nineteenth century, the industrializing West entered  the third and most dynamic phase of its centuries- old expansion into non-Western lands. In so doing,  Western nations promoted a prodigious growth of world  trade, forced reluctant countries such as China and Japan  into the globalizing economy, and profitably subordinated  many lands to their economic interests. Western  nations also sent forth millions of emigrants to the sparsely  populated areas of European settlement, which generally  limited migration from Asia. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" After 1875, Western countries grabbed vast political  empires in Africa and rushed to establish political influence  in Asia. The reasons for this culminating surge were  many, but the economic thrust of robust industrial capitalism,  an ever-growing lead in technology, and the competitive  pressures of European nationalism were particularly  important. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Western expansion had far-reaching consequences. For  the first time in human history, the world became in many  ways a single unit. Moreover, European expansion diffused  the ideas and techniques of a highly developed civilization.  Yet the West relied on force to conquer and rule, and it  treated non-Western peoples as racial inferiors. Thus non- Western elites, often armed with Western doctrines, gradually  responded to the Western challenge. As the histories  of India, Japan, and China show, non-Western elites  launched a national, anti-imperialist struggle for dignity,  genuine independence, and modernization. This struggle  would emerge as a central drama of world history after the  great European civil war of 1914 to 1918, which reduced  the West’s technological advantage and shattered its self- confidence and complacent moral superiority.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Guides for housekeeping became popular in  Europe in the nineteenth century as middle-class  women funneled great energy into their homes. A  British woman in India probably consulted The  Complete Indian Housekeeper and Cook by Flora  Annie Steel and Grace Gardiner, a bestseller  published in 1888 and frequently updated. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Steel (1847–1929) moved to India in 1867 with her  husband, a civil engineer, and lived there until the  family returned to England in 1889. Accustomed to  directing a large household with several Indian  servants, Steel believed herself well qualified to offer  advice “to English girls to whom fate may assign the  task of being house-mothers in our Eastern empire.  The following passage focuses on how the British  mistress should manage her Indian servants, and  along with practical suggestions it lays bare some  basic attitudes and assumptions of Europeans in  colonial settings. Steel subsequently wrote books on  India, education, and women’s issues. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Housekeeping in India, when once the first  strangeness has worn off, is a far easier task in many  ways than it is in England, though it none the less  requires time, and, in this present transitional  period, an almost phenomenal patience. . . . "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And, first it must be distinctly understood that it  is not necessary, or in the least degree desirable, that  an educated woman should waste the best years of  her life in scolding and petty supervision. Life holds  higher duties, and it is indubitable that friction and  over-zeal is a sure sign of a bad housekeeper.... "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Easy, however, as the actual housekeeping is in  India, the personal attention of the mistress is  quite as much needed here as at home. The  Indian servant, it is true, learns more readily, and  is guiltless of the sniffiness with which Mary Jane  [the servant in England] receives suggestions, but  a few days of absence or neglect on the part of the  mistress, results in the servants falling into their  old habits with the inherited conservatism of dirt.  This is, of course, disheartening, but it has to be "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 876 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" faced as a necessary condition of life, until a few  generations of training shall have started the  Indian servant on a new inheritance of habit. It  must never be forgotten that at present those  mistresses who aim at anything beyond keeping a  good table are in the minority, and that  pioneering is always arduous work. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The first duty of a mistress is, of course, to be  able to give intelligible orders to her servants;  therefore it is necessary she should learn to speak  Hindustani. No sane Englishwomen would dream  of living, say, for twenty years, in Germany, Italy,  or France, without making the attempt, at any  rate, to learn the language. . . . "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The next duty is obviously to insist on her  orders being carried out. And here we come to  the burning question: “How is this to be done?  Certainly, there is at present very little to which  we can appeal in the average Indian servant, but  then, until it is implanted by training, there is very  little sense of duty in a child; yet in some well- regulated nurseries obedience is a foregone  conclusion. The secret lies in making rules, and  keeping to them. The Indian servant is a child in  everything save age, and should be treated as a  child; that is to say, kindly, but with the greatest  firmness. The laws of the household should be  those of the Medes and Persians, and first faults  should never go unpunished. By overlooking a  first offence, we lose the only opportunity we have  of preventing it becoming a habit. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But it will be asked, How are we to punish our  servants when we have no hold either on their  minds or bodies? . . . "}

"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A first step was the creation in 1873 of the conservative  Three Emperors’ League, which linked the monarchs  of Austria-Hungary, Germany, and Russia in an  alliance against radical movements. In 1877 and 1878,  when Russia’s victories in a war with the Ottoman Empire  threatened the balance of Austrian and Russian interests  in the Balkans and the balance of British and  Russian interests in the entire Middle East, Bismarck  played the role of sincere peacemaker. But his balancing  efforts at the Congress of Berlin in 1878 infuriated Russian  nationalists, and this led Bismarck to conclude a defensive  military alliance with Austria against Russia in  1879. This alliance lasted until 1918 and the end of  World War I. Motivated by tensions with France, Italy  joined Germany and Austria in 1882, thereby forming  what became known as the Triple Alliance.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Germany’s decision to add a large, enormously expensive  fleet of big-gun battleships to its already expanding  navy also heightened tensions after 1907. German nationalists,  led by the extremely persuasive Admiral Alfred  von Tirpitz, saw a large navy as the legitimate mark of a  great world power and as a source of pride and patriotic  unity. But British leaders such as David Lloyd George  saw it as a detestable military challenge, which forced  them to spend the “People’s Budget (see page 835) on  battleships rather than social welfare. Unscrupulous journalists  and special-interest groups in both countries also  portrayed healthy competition in foreign trade and investment  as a form of economic warfare. In 1909 the  mass-circulation London Daily Mail hysterically informed  its readers in a series of reports that “Germany is deliberately  preparing to destroy the British Empire.2 By then  Britain was psychologically, if not officially, in the Franco- Russian camp. The leading nations of Europe were divided  into two hostile blocs, both ill-prepared to deal with  upheaval on Europe’s southeastern frontier. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Outbreak of War "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the early years of the twentieth century, war in the Balkans  was as inevitable as anything can be in human history.  The reason was simple: nationalism was destroying the Ottoman  Empire in Europe and threatening to break up the  Austro-Hungarian Empire. The only questions were what  kinds of wars would occur and where they would lead. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Greece had long before led the struggle for national  liberation, winning its independence in 1832. In 1875  widespread nationalist rebellion in the European provinces  of the sprawling Ottoman Empire had resulted in Turkish  repression, Russian intervention, and Great Power tensions.  Bismarck had helped resolve this crisis at the 1878  Congress of Berlin, which worked out the partial division  of Turkish possessions in Europe. Austria-Hungary obtained  the right to “occupy and administer Bosnia and  Herzegovina. Serbia and Romania won independence,  and a part of Bulgaria won local autonomy. The Ottoman  Empire retained important Balkan holdings, for Austria- Hungary and Russia each feared the other’s domination  of totally independent states in the area (see Map 27.1). "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" By 1903, however, nationalism in southeastern Europe  was on the rise once again. Serbia led the way, becoming  openly hostile toward both Austria-Hungary and  the Ottoman Empire. The Serbs, a Slavic people, looked  to Slavic Russia for support of their national aspirations.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Then, in 1912, in the First Balkan War, Serbia joined  Greece and Bulgaria to attack the Ottoman Empire and  then quarreled with Bulgaria over the spoils of victory—  a dispute that led in 1913 to the Second Balkan War.  Austria intervened in 1913 and forced Serbia to give up  Albania. After centuries, nationalism had finally destroyed  the Ottoman Empire in Europe (see Map 27.2). This  sudden but long-awaited event elated the Balkan nationalists  and dismayed the leaders of multinational Austria- Hungary. The former hoped and the latter feared that  Austria might be next to be broken apart. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Within this tense context, Archduke Francis Ferdinand,  heir to the Austrian and Hungarian thrones, and his wife,  Sophie, were assassinated by Serbian revolutionaries living  in Bosnia on June 28, 1914, during a state visit to the  Bosnian capital of Sarajevo. After some hesitation, the  leaders of Austria-Hungary concluded that Serbia was  implicated and had to be severely punished once and for  all. On July 23 Austria-Hungary finally presented Serbia  with an unconditional ultimatum. The Serbian government  had forty-eight hours in which to agree to demands  that would amount to ceding control of the Serbian  state. When Serbia replied moderately but evasively,  Austria began to mobilize and then declared war on Serbia  on July 28. Thus a desperate multinational Austria- Hungary deliberately chose war in a last-ditch attempt to  stem the rising tide of hostile nationalism within its  borders and save the existing state. The “Third Balkan  War had begun. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Of prime importance in Austria-Hungary’s fateful decision  was Germany’s unconditional support. Emperor  William II and his chancellor, Theobald von Bethmann- Hollweg, realized that war between Austria and Russia was  the most probable result, for a resurgent Russia could  not stand by, as in the Bosnian crisis, and simply watch  the Serbs be crushed. Yet Bethmann-Hollweg apparently  hoped that while Russia (and therefore France) would go  to war, Great Britain would remain neutral, unwilling to  fight for “Russian aggression in the distant Balkans.

Paris and France had been  miraculously saved (see Map 27.3). "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Soon, with the armies stalled, both sides began to dig  trenches to protect themselves from machine-gun fire.  By November 1914, an unbroken line of trenches extended  from the Belgian ports through northern France,  past the fortress of Verdun, and on to the Swiss frontier.  In the face of this unexpected stalemate, slaughter on the  western front began in earnest. The defenders on both  sides dug in behind rows of trenches, mines, and barbed  wire. For days and even weeks, ceaseless shelling by heavy  artillery supposedly “softened up the enemy in a given  area (and also signaled the coming attack). Then young  draftees and their junior officers went “over the top of  the trenches in frontal attacks on the enemy’s line. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The cost in lives of this trench warfare was staggering,  the gains in territory minuscule. The massive French and  British offensives during 1915 never gained more than  3 miles of blood-soaked earth from the enemy. In the Battle  of the Somme in the summer of 1916, the British and  French gained an insignificant 125 square miles at the cost  of 600,000 dead or wounded, while the Germans lost  500,000 men. In that same year the unsuccessful German  campaign against Verdun cost 700,000 lives on both sides.  British poet Siegfried Sassoon (1886–1967) wrote of the  Somme offensive, “I am staring at a sunlit picture of Hell. "}

Controlling  much of the Ottoman Empire’s territory along the Red  Sea, an area known as the Hejaz (see Map 27.5), Hussein  managed in 1915 to win vague British commitments for  an independent Arab kingdom. Thus in 1916 Hussein  revolted against the Turks, proclaiming himself king of  the Arabs. He joined forces with the British under T. E.  Lawrence, who in 1917 led Arab tribesmen and Indian  soldiers in a highly successful guerrilla war against the  Turks on the Arabian peninsula. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Similar victories were eventually scored in the Ottoman  province of Iraq. Britain occupied the southern  Iraqi city of Basra in 1914 and captured Baghdad in  1917. In September 1918 British armies and their Arab  allies rolled into Syria. This offensive culminated in the  triumphal entry of Hussein’s son Faisal into Damascus.  Throughout Syria and Iraq there was wild Arab rejoicing.  Many patriots expected a large, unified Arab nation-state  to rise from the dust of the Ottoman collapse. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As world war engulfed and revolutionized the Middle  East, it also spread to some parts of East Asia and Africa.  Instead of revolting as the Germans hoped, the colonial  subjects of the British and French generally supported their  foreign masters, providing crucial supplies and fighting in  Europe and the Ottoman Empire. They also helped local  British and French commanders seize Germany’s colonies  around the globe. The Japanese, allied in Asia with the  British since 1902, similarly used the war to grab German  outposts in the Pacific Ocean and on the Chinese mainland,  infuriating Chinese patriots and heightening longstanding  tensions between China and Japan. More than a  million Africans and Asians served in the various armies  of the warring powers; more than double that number  served as porters to carry equipment. The French, facing a  shortage of young men, made especially heavy use of colonial  troops. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In April 1917 the United States declared war on Germany,  another crucial development in the expanding  conflict. American intervention grew out of the war at  sea, sympathy for the Triple Entente, and the increasing  desperation of total war. At the beginning of the war,  Britain and France had established a total naval blockade "}

In early 1915  Germany retaliated with a counter-blockade using the murderously  effective submarine, a new weapon that violated  traditional niceties of fair warning under international law.  In May 1915 a German submarine sank the British passenger  liner Lusitania,  claiming more than 1,000 lives, among  them 139 Americans. President Woodrow Wilson protested  vigorously. Germany was forced to relax its submarine warfare  for almost two years; the alternative was almost certain  war with the United States. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Early in 1917, the German military command—confident  that improved submarines could starve Britain into submission  before the United States could come to its rescue—  resumed unrestricted submarine warfare. Like the invasion  of Belgium, this was a reckless gamble. “German submarine  warfare against commerce, President Wilson had told  a sympathetic Congress and people, “is a warfare against  mankind. Thus the last uncommitted great nation, as  fresh and enthusiastic as Europe had been in 1914, entered  the world war in April 1917, almost three years after it began.  Eventually the United States was to tip the balance in  favor of the Triple Entente and its allies. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" In August 1914, most people greeted the outbreak of  hostilities enthusiastically. In every country, the masses believed  that their nation was in the right and defending itself  from aggression. With the exception of a few extreme  left-wingers, even socialists supported the war. Everywhere  the support of the masses and working class contributed  to national unity and an energetic war effort. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" By mid-October generals and politicians had begun to  realize that more than patriotism would be needed to  win the war, whose end was not in sight. Each country  experienced a relentless, desperate demand for men and  weapons. In each country, economic life and organization  had to change and change fast to keep the war machine  from sputtering to a stop. And change they did. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \f 891 891  In each country, a government of national unity began to  plan and control economic and social life in order to wage  total war. Free-market capitalism was abandoned, at least  “for the duration. Instead, government planning boards  established priorities and decided what was to be produced  and consumed. Rationing, price and wage controls, and  even restrictions on workers’ freedom of movement were  imposed by government. Only through such regimentation  could a country make the greatest possible military effort.  Thus, though there were national variations, the great  nations all moved toward planned economies commanded  by the established political leadership. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The economy of total war blurred the old distinction between  soldiers on the battlefield and civilians at home. The  war was a war of whole peoples and entire populations.  Based on tremendously productive industrial economies not  confined to a single nation, total war yielded an effective—  and therefore destructive—war effort on all sides. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Food was also rationed in accordance with physical  need. Men and women doing hard manual work were  given extra rations. During the last two years of the war,  only children and expectant mothers received milk rations.  At the same time, Germany failed to tax the war  profits of private firms heavily enough. This failure contributed  to massive deficit financing, inflation, the growth  of a black market, and the eventual re-emergence of class  conflict. "}

With the First World  War, state socialism became for the first time a realistic  economic blueprint rather than a utopian program. Germany  illustrates the general trend. It also went furthest in  developing a planned economy to wage total war. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As soon as war began, Walter Rathenau, the talented,  foresighted Jewish industrialist in charge of Germany’s  largest electric company, convinced the government to  set up the War Raw Materials Board to ration and  distribute raw materials. Under Rathenau’s direction,  every useful material from foreign oil to barnyard manure  was inventoried and rationed. Moreover, the board  launched successful attempts to produce substitutes such  as synthetic rubber and synthetic nitrates, needed to make  explosives and essential to the blockaded German war machine.  An aggressive recycling campaign, including everything  from fruit peels to women’s hair, augmented these  efforts. "}

People  averaged little more than one thousand calories a day.  Thus in Germany total war led to the establishment of  history’s first “totalitarian society, and war production  increased while some people starved to death. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Great Britain mobilized for total war less rapidly and  less completely than Germany, for it could import materials  from its empire and from the United States. By 1915,  however, a serious shortage of shells had led to the establishment  of the Ministry of Munitions under David Lloyd  George. The ministry organized private industry to produce  for the war, controlled profits, allocated labor, fixed  wage rates, and settled labor disputes. By December 1916,  when Lloyd George became prime minister, the British  economy was largely planned and regulated. Great Britain  had followed successfully in Germany’s footsteps. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Social Impact "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The social impact of total war was no less profound than  the economic impact, though again there were important "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" national variations. The millions of men at the front and  the insatiable needs of the military created a tremendous  demand for workers. Jobs were available for everyone. This  situation—seldom, if ever, seen before 1914, when unemployment  and poverty had been facts of urban life—  brought about momentous changes. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" One such change was greater power and prestige for labor  unions. Having proved their loyalty in August 1914,  labor unions cooperated with war governments on work  rules, wages, and production schedules in return for real  participation in important decisions. This entry of labor  leaders and unions into policymaking councils paralleled  the entry of socialist leaders into the war governments. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The role of women changed dramatically. In every  country, large numbers of women left home and domestic  service to work in industry, transportation, and offices.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Brittain grew up in a wealthy business family in  northern England, bristling at small-town conventions  and discrimination against women. Very close to her  brother Edward, two years her junior, Brittain read  voraciously and dreamed of being a successful writer.  Finishing boarding school and beating down her father’s  objections, she prepared for Oxford’s rigorous  entry exams and won a scholarship to its women’s college.  Brittain also fell in love with Roland Leighton, an  equally brilliant student from a literary family and her  brother’s best friend. All three, along with two more  close friends, Victor Richardson and Geoffrey Thurlow,  confidently prepared to enter Oxford in late 1914. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When war suddenly approached in July 1914, Brittain  shared with millions of Europeans a thrilling surge  of patriotic support for her government, a pro-war  enthusiasm she later played down in her published  writings. She wrote in her diary that her “great fear  was that England would declare its neutrality and commit  the “grossest treachery toward France.* She seconded  Roland’s decision to enlist, agreeing with her  sweetheart’s glamorous view of war as “very ennobling  and very beautiful. Later, exchanging anxious letters  in 1915 with Roland in France, Vera began to see the  conflict in personal, human terms. She wondered if any  victory or defeat could be worth Roland’s life. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Struggling to quell her doubts, Brittain redoubled  her commitment to England’s cause and volunteered as  an army nurse. For the next three years she served with  distinction in military hospitals in London, Malta, and  northern France, repeatedly torn between the vision of  noble sacrifice and the reality of human tragedy. She  lost her sexual inhibitions caring for mangled male  bodies, and she longed to consummate her love with  Roland. Awaiting his return on leave on Christmas Day  in 1915, she was greeted instead with a telegram:  Roland had been killed two days before. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Roland’s death was the first of the devastating blows  that eventually overwhelmed Brittain’s idealistic patriotism.  In 1917, first Geoffrey and then Victor died from  gruesome wounds. In early 1918, as the last great German  offensive covered the floors of her war-zone hospital  with maimed and dying German prisoners, the bone- weary Vera felt a common humanity and saw only "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" more victims. A few weeks  later brother Edward—her last  hope—died in action. When  the war ended, she was, she  said, a “complete automaton,  with “my deepest emotions  paralyzed if not dead. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Returning to Oxford and  finishing her studies, Brittain  gradually recovered. She  formed a deep, restorative  friendship with another talented  woman writer, Winifred  Holtby, published novels and  articles, and became a leader in  the feminist campaign for gender  equality.

Finally, Brittain succeeded in coming to grips  with them in Testament of Youth, her powerful antiwar  autobiography. The unflinching narrative spoke to the  experiences of an entire generation and became a runaway  bestseller. Above all perhaps, Brittain captured the  ambivalent, contradictory character of the war, when  millions of young people found excitement, courage, and  common purpose but succeeded only in destroying their  lives with their superhuman efforts and futile sacrifices.  Becoming ever more committed to pacifism, Brittain  opposed England’s entry into World War II. "}

Why did Brittain volunteer as a nurse, as many women  did? Judging from her account, how might wartime  nursing have influenced women of her generation?  3. In portraying the ambivalent, contradictory  character of World War I for Europe’s youth, was  Brittain describing the contradictory character of all  modern warfare?  *Quoted in the excellent study by P.

{"prompt":"","completion":" War promoted greater social equality, blurring class distinctions  and lessening the gap between rich and poor. This  blurring was most apparent in Great Britain, where wartime  hardship was never extreme. In fact, the bottom third of the  population generally lived better than they ever had, for the  poorest gained most from the severe shortage of labor. In  continental countries, greater equality was reflected in full  employment, rationing according to physical needs, and a  sharing of hardships. There, too, society became more uniform  and more egalitarian, in spite of some war profiteering. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Finally, death itself had no respect for traditional social  distinctions. It savagely decimated the young aristocratic  officers who led the charge, and it fell heavily on the mass  of drafted peasants and unskilled workers who followed.  Yet death often spared the aristocrats of labor, the skilled  workers and foremen. Their lives were too valuable to  squander at the front, for they were needed to train the  newly recruited women and older unskilled men laboring  valiantly in war plants at home. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Growing Political Tensions "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" During the first two years of war, most soldiers and civilians  supported their governments. Belief in a just cause, patriotic  nationalism, the planned economy, and a sharing of  burdens united peoples behind their various national  leaders. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Each government employed rigorous censorship to control  public opinion, and each used both crude and subtle  propaganda to maintain popular support. German propaganda  hysterically pictured black soldiers from France’s  African empire raping German women, while German  atrocities in Belgium and elsewhere were ceaselessly recounted  and exaggerated by the French and British. Patriotic  posters and slogans, slanted news, and biased editorials  inflamed national hatreds and helped sustain superhuman  efforts. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" By the spring of 1916, however, people were beginning  to crack under the strain of total war. In April 1916,  Irish nationalists in Dublin tried to take advantage of this  situation and rose up against British rule in their great  Easter Rebellion. A week of bitter fighting passed before "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" the rebels were crushed and their leaders executed. On  May 1, 1916, several thousand demonstrators in Berlin  heard the radical socialist leader Karl Liebknecht (1871–  1919) shout, “Down with the government! Down with  the war! Liebknecht was immediately arrested and imprisoned,  but his daring action electrified Europe’s far  left. Strikes and protest marches over inadequate food  began to flare up on every home front. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Soldiers’ morale also began to decline. Italian troops mutinied.  Numerous French units refused to fight after the  disastrous French offensive of May 1917. Only tough military  justice for leaders and a tacit agreement with the troops  that there would be no more grand offensives enabled the  new general in chief, Henri Philippe Pétain, to restore order.  A rising tide of war-weariness and defeatism also swept  France’s civilian population before Georges Clemenceau  emerged as a ruthless and effective wartime leader in November  1917. Clemenceau (1841–1929) established a virtual  dictatorship, pouncing on strikers and jailing without  trial journalists and politicians who dared to suggest a compromise  peace with Germany. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The strains were worse for the Central Powers. In October  1916, the chief minister of Austria was assassinated by  a young socialist crying, “Down with Absolutism! We  want peace!4 The following month, when feeble old Emperor  Francis Joseph died, a symbol of unity disappeared.  In spite of absolute censorship, political dissatisfaction and  conflicts among nationalities grew. In April 1917, Austria’s  chief minister summed up the situation in the gloomiest  possible terms. The country and army were exhausted.  Another winter of war would bring revolution and disintegration.  Both Czech and Yugoslav leaders demanded autonomous  democratic states for their peoples. The British  blockade kept tightening; people were starving. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The strain of total war and of the Auxiliary Service Law  was also evident in Germany. In the winter of 1916 to  1917, Germany’s military position appeared increasingly  desperate. Stalemates and losses in the west were matched  by temporary Russian advances in the east: hence the military’s  insistence on an all-or-nothing gamble of unrestricted  submarine warfare when the Triple Entente refused in December  1916 to consider peace on terms favorable to the  Central Powers. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Also, the national political unity of the first two years of  war was collapsing as the social conflict of prewar Germany  re-emerged. A growing minority of moderate socialists in  the Reichstag called for a compromise “peace without annexations  or reparations. Such a peace was unthinkable  for conservatives and military leaders. So also was the surge  in revolutionary agitation and strikes by war-weary workers  that occurred in early 1917. When the bread ration was "}

Thus militaristic Germany, like its ally Austria-Hungary  (and its enemy France), was beginning to crack in 1917.  Yet it was Russia that collapsed first and saved the Central  Powers—for a time. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Russian Revolution of 1917 was one of modern history’s  most momentous events. Directly related to the  growing tensions of World War I, it had a significance far  beyond the wartime agonies of a single European nation.  The Russian Revolution opened a new era. For some, it  was Marx’s socialist vision come true; for others, it was  the triumph of dictatorship. To all, it presented a radically  new prototype of state and society. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" • Why did World War I bring socialist revolution in Russia?  The Fall of Imperial Russia "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Like its allies and its enemies, Russia embraced war with  patriotic enthusiasm in 1914. At the Winter Palace, while  throngs of people knelt and sang, “God save the tsar, Tsar  Nicholas II (r. 1894–1917) repeated the oath Alexander I  had sworn in 1812 and vowed never to make peace as long  as the enemy stood on Russian soil. Russia’s lower house,  the Duma, voted war credits. Conservatives anticipated  expansion in the Balkans, while liberals and most socialists  believed alliance with Britain and France would bring democratic  reforms. For a moment, Russia was united. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Unprecedented artillery barrages used up Russia’s supplies  of shells and ammunition, and better-equipped German  armies inflicted terrible losses. In 1915 substantial  numbers of Russian soldiers were sent to the front without  rifles; they were told to find their arms among the  dead. There were 2 million Russian casualties in 1915  alone. Nevertheless, Russia’s battered peasant army did  not collapse but continued to fight courageously, and  Russia moved toward full mobilization on the home front.  The Duma and organs of local government took the lead,  setting up special committees to coordinate defense, industry,  transportation, and agriculture. These efforts improved  the military situation. Yet there were many failures,  and Russia mobilized less effectively for total war than  the other warring nations. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The great problem was leadership. Under the constitution  resulting from the revolution of 1905 (see pages "}

Legislation proposed by  the Duma, which was weighted in favor of the wealthy  and conservative classes, was subject to the tsar’s veto.  Moreover, Nicholas II fervently wished to maintain the  sacred inheritance of supreme royal power. A kindly,  slightly stupid man, Nicholas failed to form a close partnership  with his citizens in order to fight the war more effectively.  He came to rely instead on the old bureaucratic  apparatus, distrusting the moderate Duma, rejecting popular  involvement, and resisting calls to share power. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As a result, the Duma, the educated middle classes,  and the masses became increasingly critical of the tsar’s  leadership. In September 1915 parties ranging from conservative  to moderate socialist formed the Progressive  bloc, which called for a completely new government responsible  to the Duma instead of the tsar. In answer,  Nicholas temporarily adjourned the Duma and announced  that he was traveling to the front in order to  lead and rally Russia’s armies. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" His departure was a fatal turning point. With the tsar  in the field with the troops, control of the government  was taken over by the hysterical empress, Tsarina Alexandra,  and a debauched adventurer and self-proclaimed  holy man, Rasputin. Nicholas’s wife was a strong-willed  woman with a hatred of parliaments. Having constantly  urged her husband to rule absolutely, Alexandra tried  to do so herself in his absence.

He refused to confiscate large landholdings  and give them to peasants, fearing that such drastic  action in the countryside would only complete the disintegration  of Russia’s peasant army. For the patriotic Kerensky,  as for other moderate socialists, the continuation of  war was still the all-important national duty.

Modeled  on the revolutionary soviets of 1905, the Petrograd Soviet  was a huge, fluctuating mass meeting of two thousand to  three thousand workers, soldiers, and socialist intellectuals.  Seeing itself as a true grassroots revolutionary democracy,  this counter- or half-government suspiciously watched the  provisional government and issued its own radical orders,  further weakening the provisional government.

Lenin demanded a small, disciplined,  elitist party, while his opponents wanted a more democratic  party with mass membership. The Russian party of Marxian  socialism promptly split into two rival factions. Lenin’s  camp was called Bolsheviks, or “majority group; his opponents  were Mensheviks, or “minority group.

After the March revolution the German  government provided the impatient Lenin, his wife, and  about twenty trusted colleagues with safe passage across  Germany and back into Russia in April 1917. The Germans  hoped that Lenin would undermine the sagging war effort  of the world’s freest society. They were not disappointed. "}

He was charged with being a  German agent, and indeed he and the Bolsheviks were  getting money from Germany.5 But no matter. Intrigue  between Kerensky, who became prime minister in July,  and his commander in chief, General Lavr Kornilov, resulted  in Kornilov’s leading a feeble attack against the  provisional government in September. In the face of this  rightist “counter-revolutionary threat, the Bolsheviks  were rearmed and redeemed. Kornilov’s forces disintegrated,  but Kerensky lost all credit with the army, the only  force that might have saved him and democratic government  in Russia. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Trotsky and the Seizure of Power "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Throughout the summer, the Bolsheviks had appealed  very effectively to the workers and soldiers of Petrograd,  markedly increasing their popular support. Party membership  had soared from 50,000 to 240,000, and in October  the Bolsheviks gained a fragile majority in the  Petrograd Soviet. It was now Lenin’s supporter Leon  Trotsky (1879–1940), a spellbinding revolutionary orator  and independent radical Marxist, who brilliantly executed  the Bolshevik seizure of power. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Painting a vivid but untruthful picture of German and  counter-revolutionary plots, Trotsky first convinced the  Petrograd Soviet to form a special military-revolutionary  committee in October and make him its leader. Military  power in the capital passed into Bolshevik hands. Then,  on the night of November 6, militants from Trotsky’s  committee joined with trusty Bolshevik soldiers to seize  government buildings and pounce on members of the  provisional government. Then they went on to the congress  of soviets.

{"prompt":"","completion":" The Bolsheviks came to power for three key reasons.  First, by late 1917 democracy had given way to anarchy:  power was there for those who would take it. Second, in  Lenin and Trotsky the Bolsheviks had an utterly determined  and truly superior leadership, which both the tsarist  government and the provisional government lacked. Third,  in 1917 the Bolsheviks succeeded in appealing to many  soldiers and urban workers, people who were exhausted  by war and eager for socialism. With time, many workers "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" History is full of short-lived coups and unsuccessful revolutions.  The truly monumental accomplishment of Lenin,  Trotsky, and the rest of the Bolsheviks was not taking  power but keeping it. In the next four years, the Bolsheviks  went on to conquer the chaos they had helped  create, and they began to build their kind of dictatorial  socialist society. The conspirators became conquerors. How  was this done? "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Unlike many of his colleagues, Lenin acknowledged  that Russia had lost the war with Germany and that the  only realistic goal was peace at any price. That price was  very high. Germany demanded in December 1917 that  the Soviet government give up all its western territories.  These areas were inhabited by Poles, Finns, Lithuanians,  and other non-Russians—all those people who had been  conquered by the tsars over three centuries and put into  the “prisonhouse of nationalities, as Lenin had earlier  called the Russian empire. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" At first, Lenin’s fellow Bolsheviks would not accept such  great territorial losses. But when German armies resumed  their unopposed march into Russia in February 1918,  Lenin had his way in a very close vote in the Central Committee  of the party. “Not even his greatest enemy can deny  that at this moment Lenin towered like a giant over his  Bolshevik colleagues.6 A third of old Russia’s population  was sliced away by the German meat ax in the Treaty of  Brest-Litovsk in March 1918. With peace, Lenin had  escaped the certain disaster of continued war and could  pursue his goal of absolute political power for the  Bolsheviks—now renamed Communists—within Russia. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Lenin had the genius to profit from developments over  which he and the Bolsheviks had no control. Since summer,  a peasant revolution had been sweeping across Russia  as the tillers of the soil invaded and divided among themselves  the estates of the landlords and the church. Peasant  seizure of the land—a Russian 1789—was not very Marxian,  but it was quite unstoppable in 1917. Thus Lenin’s  first law, which supposedly gave land to the peasants, actually  merely approved what peasants were already doing.  Urban workers’ great demand in November was direct  control of individual factories by local workers committees.  This, too, Lenin ratified with a decree in November. "}

By the end of the year, White armies  were on the attack. In October 1919, it appeared they  might triumph, as they closed in on Lenin’s government  from three sides. Yet they did not. By the spring of 1920,  the White armies had been almost completely defeated,  and the Bolshevik Red Army had retaken Belorussia and  Ukraine. The following year, the Communists also reconquered  the independent nationalist governments of  the Caucasus. The civil war was over; Lenin had won. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Lenin and the Bolsheviks won for several reasons. Strategically,  they controlled the center, while the Whites were  always on the fringes and disunited. Moreover, the poorly  defined political program of the Whites was vaguely conservative,  and it did not unite all the foes of the Bolsheviks  under a progressive, democratic banner. Most important,  the Communists quickly developed a better army, an army  for which the divided Whites were no match. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Once again, Trotsky’s leadership was decisive. The Bolsheviks  had preached democracy in the army and elected  officers in 1917. But beginning in March 1918, Trotsky as  war commissar re-established the draft and the most drastic  discipline for the newly formed Red Army. Soldiers deserting  or disobeying an order were summarily shot. Moreover,  Trotsky made effective use of former tsarist army  officers, who were actively recruited and given unprecedented  powers of discipline over their troops. In short,  Trotsky formed a disciplined and effective fighting force. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Bolsheviks also mobilized the home front. Establishing  war communism—the application of the total  war concept to a civil conflict—they seized grain from  peasants, introduced rationing, nationalized all banks and  industry, and required everyone to work. Although these  measures contributed to a breakdown of normal economic  activity, they also served to maintain labor discipline  and to keep the Red Army supplied. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" “Revolutionary terror also contributed to the Communist  victory. The old tsarist secret police was re-established  as the Cheka, which hunted down and executed thousands  of real or supposed foes, such as the tsar and his family  and other “class enemies. Moreover, people were shot or  threatened with being shot for minor nonpolitical failures.  The terror caused by the secret police became a tool of the  government. The Cheka sowed fear, and fear silenced  opposition. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Finally, foreign military intervention in the civil war ended  up helping the Communists. After Lenin made peace with  Germany, the Allies (United States, Britain, Japan) sent  troops to Archangel and Vladivostok to prevent war materiel  they had sent the provisional government from being  captured by the Germans. After the Soviet government nationalized  all foreign-owned factories without compensation  and refused to pay all of Russia’s foreign debts,  Western governments, particularly France, began to support  White armies in the south and west. Yet these efforts  were small and halfhearted. In 1919 Western peoples were  sick of war, and few Western politicians believed in a military  crusade against the Bolsheviks. Thus Allied intervention  in the civil war did not aid the Whites effectively,  though it did permit the Communists to appeal to the patriotic  nationalism of ethnic Russians, in particular former "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \f tsarist army officers. Allied intervention was both too little  and too much. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Together, the Russian Revolution and the Bolshevik triumph  were one of the reasons the First World War was  such a great turning point in modern history. A radically  new government, based on socialism and one-party dictatorship,  came to power in a great European state, maintained  power, and eagerly encouraged worldwide revolution.  Although halfhearted constitutional monarchy in Russia  was undoubtedly headed for some kind of political crisis  before 1914, it is hard to imagine the triumph of the most  radical proponents of change and reform except in a situation  of total collapse. That was precisely what happened  to Russia in the First World War. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Victory over revolutionary Russia boosted sagging German  morale, and in the spring of 1918 the Germans launched  their last major attack against France. Yet this offensive  failed, just as those before it had. With breathtaking rapidity,  the United States, Great Britain, and France decisively  defeated Germany militarily. The guns of world war finally  fell silent. Then as civil war spread in Russia and as chaos  engulfed much of eastern Europe, the victorious Western  Allies came together in Paris to establish a lasting peace. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Expectations were high; optimism was almost unlimited.  The Allies labored intensively and soon worked out  terms for peace with Germany and for the creation of  the peacekeeping League of Nations. Nevertheless, the  hopes of peoples and politicians were soon disappointed,  for the peace settlement of 1919 turned out to be a failure.  Rather than creating conditions for peace, it sowed  the seeds of another war.

For a time, German  armies pushed forward, coming within thirty-five miles  of Paris. But Ludendorff’s exhausted, overextended forces  never broke through. They were decisively stopped in  July at the second Battle of the Marne, where 140,000  fresh American soldiers saw action. Adding 2 million  men in arms to the war effort by August, the late but  massive American intervention decisively tipped the scales  in favor of Allied victory. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" By September British, French, and American armies were  advancing steadily on all fronts, and a panicky General Ludendorff  realized that Germany had lost the war. Yet he insolently  insisted that moderate politicians shoulder the  shame of defeat, and on October 4 the emperor formed a  new, more liberal German government to sue for peace. As  negotiations over an armistice dragged on, an angry and  frustrated German people finally rose up. On November 3,  sailors in Kiel mutinied, and throughout northern Germany  soldiers and workers began to establish revolutionary councils  on the Russian soviet model. The same day, Austria- Hungary surrendered to the Allies and began breaking  apart. Revolution broke out in Germany, and masses of  workers demonstrated for peace in Berlin. With army discipline  collapsing, the emperor abdicated and fled to Holland.  Socialist leaders in Berlin proclaimed a German republic on  November 9 and simultaneously agreed to tough Allied  terms of surrender. The armistice went into effect on November  11, 1918. The war was over. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Military defeat brought political revolution to Germany  and Austria-Hungary, as it had to Russia. In Austria- Hungary the revolution was primarily nationalistic and republican  in character. Having started the war to preserve  an antinationalistic dynastic state, the Habsburg empire  had perished in the attempt. In its place, independent  Austrian, Hungarian, and Czechoslovakian republics were  proclaimed, while a greatly expanded Serbian monarchy  united the South Slavs and took the name Yugoslavia. The  prospect of firmly establishing the new national states overrode  class considerations for most people in east-central  Europe. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The German Revolution of November 1918 resembled  the Russian Revolution of March 1917. In both cases, a  genuine popular uprising welled up from below, toppled  an authoritarian monarchy, and brought the establishment "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" of a liberal provisional republic. In both countries, liberals  and moderate socialists took control of the central government,  while workers’ and soldiers’ councils formed a  counter-government. In Germany, however, the moderate  socialists and their liberal allies won, and the Lenin-like  radical revolutionaries in the councils lost. In communist  terms, the liberal, republican revolution in Germany in  1918 was only half a revolution: a bourgeois political revolution  without a communist second installment. It was  Russia without Lenin’s Bolshevik triumph. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There were several reasons for the German outcome.  The great majority of Marxian socialist leaders in the  Social Democratic Party were, as before the war, really  pink and not red. They wanted to establish real political  democracy and civil liberties, and they favored the gradual  elimination of capitalism. They were also German  nationalists, appalled by the prospect of civil war and revolutionary  terror. Moreover, there was less popular support  among workers, soldiers, and peasants. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Of crucial importance was the fact that the moderate  German Social Democrats, unlike Kerensky and company,  accepted defeat and ended the war the day they took power.  This act ended the decline in morale among soldiers and  prevented the regular army, with its conservative officer  corps, from disintegrating. When radicals headed by Karl  Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg and their supporters in  the councils tried to seize control of the government in  Berlin in January, the moderate socialists called on the army  to crush the uprising. Liebknecht and Luxemburg were arrested  and then brutally murdered by army leaders. Their  murders, widely believed to have had government support,  caused many working-class activists in the Social Democratic  Party to break away in anger and join the pro-Lenin  German Communist Party that Liebknecht’s group had  just founded. Finally, even if the moderate socialists had  followed Liebknecht and Luxemburg on the Leninist path,  it is very unlikely they would have succeeded. Civil war in  Germany would certainly have followed. And the Allies,  who were already occupying western Germany according  to the terms of the armistice, would have marched on to  Berlin and ruled Germany directly. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" The real powers at the conference were the United  States, Great Britain, and France, for Germany was not  allowed to participate and Russia was locked in civil war  and did not attend. Italy was considered part of the Big  Four, but its role was quite limited. Almost immediately  the three great Allies began to quarrel. President Wilson,  who was wildly cheered by European crowds as the  spokesman for a new idealistic and democratic international  cooperation, was almost obsessed with creating the  League of Nations. Wilson insisted that this question  come first, for he passionately believed that only a permanent  international organization could protect member  states from aggression and avert future wars. Wilson  had his way, although Lloyd George of Great Britain and  especially Clemenceau of France were unenthusiastic.  They were primarily concerned with punishing Germany. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Playing on British nationalism, Lloyd George had already  won a smashing electoral victory in December on  the popular platform of making Germany pay for the war.  “We shall, he promised, “squeeze the orange until the  pips squeak. Personally inclined to make a somewhat  moderate peace with Germany, Lloyd George was to a  considerable extent a captive of demands for a total victory  worthy of the sacrifices of total war against a totally  depraved enemy.

He feared that sooner or later Germany with its  60 million people would attack France with its 40 million unless  the Germans were permanently weakened. Moreover,  France had no English Channel (or Atlantic Ocean) as  a reassuring barrier against German aggression. Wilson, "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" In the end, convinced that France could not afford to  face Germany alone in the future, Clemenceau agreed to  a compromise. He gave up the French demand for a  Rhineland buffer state in return for a formal defensive alliance  with the United States and Great Britain. Under  the terms of this alliance, both Wilson and Lloyd George  promised that their countries would come to France’s  aid in the event of a German attack. Thus Clemenceau  appeared to win his goal of French security, as Wilson  had won his of a permanent international organization.  The Allies moved quickly to finish the settlement, believing  that any adjustments would later be possible within the  dual framework of a strong Western alliance and the  League of Nations (see Map 27.4). "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Treaty of Versailles between the Allies and Germany  was the key to the settlement, and the terms were  not unreasonable as a first step toward re-establishing international  order. Had Germany won, it seems certain  that France and Belgium would have been treated with  greater severity, as Russia had been at Brest-Litovsk.

However, when the fighting stopped, the  British and the French chose instead to honor secret  wartime agreements to divide and rule the Ottoman  lands. Most important, in 1916 Britain and France had  agreed that France would receive modern-day Lebanon  and Syria, and much of southern Turkey, and Britain  would receive Palestine, Transjordan, and Iraq.

Germany had been  punished but not dismembered. A new world organization  complemented a traditional defensive alliance of satisfied  powers.

Chapter Summary "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" World War I had truly revolutionary consequences because,  first and foremost, it was a war of committed peoples. In  France, Britain, and Germany in particular, governments  drew on genuine popular support. This support reflected in  part the diplomatic origins of the war, which citizens saw as  growing out of an unwanted crisis in the Balkans and an inflexible  alliance system of opposing blocs. More importantly,  popular support reflected the way western European  society had been unified under the nationalist banner in the  later nineteenth century, despite the fears that the growing  socialist movement aroused in conservatives.

Very shortly France was to take actions against  Germany that would feed the fires of German resentment  and seriously undermine democratic forces in the new republic.  The great hopes of early 1919 had turned to ashes  by the end of the year. The Western alliance had collapsed,  and a grandiose plan for permanent peace had given way to  a fragile truce. For this and for what came later, the United  States must share a large part of the guilt. "}

In Russia  the Bolsheviks established a radical regime, smashed  existing capitalist institutions, and stayed in power with a  new kind of authoritarian rule. Whether the new Russian  regime was truly Marxian or socialist was questionable, but  it indisputably posed a powerful, ongoing revolutionary  challenge to Europe and its colonial empires. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" More subtle but quite universal in its impact was an administrative  revolution. This revolution, born of the need  to mobilize entire societies and economies for total war,  greatly increased the power of government. Freewheeling  market capitalism and a well-integrated world economy  were among the many casualties of the administrative revolution,  and greater social equality was everywhere one of  its results. Thus even in European countries where a communist  takeover never came close to occurring, society  still experienced a great revolution. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Finally, the “war to end war did not bring peace—  only a fragile truce. In the West, the Allies failed to maintain  their wartime solidarity. Germany remained unrepentant  and would soon have more grievances to nurse.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Among the small band of thinkers in the late nineteenth  century who challenged the belief in progress and the general  faith in the rational human mind, German philosopher  Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900) was particularly influential.  The son of a Lutheran minister, Nietzsche rejected  Christianity and became a professor of classical languages  until ill health forced him to retire at an early age. Never a  systematic philosopher, Nietzsche wrote as a prophet in  a provocative and poetic style. His first great work in  1872 argued that ever since classical Athens, the West had  overemphasized rationality and stifled the passion and animal  instinct that drive human activity and true creativity.  Nietzsche went on to question all values. He claimed  that Christianity embodied a “slave morality that glorified  weakness, envy, and mediocrity. In Nietzsche’s most famous  line, a wise fool proclaims that “God is dead, dead  because he has been murdered by lackadaisical modern  Christians who no longer really believe in him. Nietzsche  viewed the pillars of conventional morality—reason, democracy,  progress, respectability—as outworn social and  psychological constructs whose influence was suffocating  self-realization and excellence. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Primary Source: God Is Dead, the Victim of Science "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Nietzsche painted a dark world, foreshadowing perhaps  his loss of sanity in 1889. The West was in decline; false  values had triumphed. The death of God left people disoriented  and depressed. The only hope for the individual  was to accept the meaninglessness of human existence  and then make that very meaninglessness a source of self- defined personal integrity and hence liberation. This would  at least be possible for a few superior individuals who  could free themselves from the humdrum thinking of the  masses and become true heroes. Little read during his active  years, Nietzsche attracted growing attention in the  early twentieth century, especially from German radicals  who found inspiration in Nietzsche’s ferocious assault on  the conventions of pre-1914 imperial Germany. Subsequent  generations have each discovered new Nietzsches,  and his influence remains enormous to this day. "}

In English-speaking countries,  the main development was the acceptance of logical  empiricism (or logical positivism) in university circles. In  continental countries, the primary development in philosophy  was existentialism. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Logical empiricism was truly revolutionary. It quite  simply rejected most of the concerns of traditional philosophy,  from the existence of God to the meaning of  happiness, as nonsense and hot air. This outlook began  primarily with Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein  (1889–1951), who later immigrated to England,  where he trained numerous disciples. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Wittgenstein argued in his pugnacious ???O "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" ?S  (Essay on Logical Philosophy) in 1922 that  philosophy is only the logical clarification of thoughts,  and therefore it becomes the study of language, which  expresses thoughts. The great philosophical issues of the  ages—God, freedom, morality, and so on—are quite literally  senseless, a great waste of time, for statements  about them can be neither tested by scientific experiments  nor demonstrated by the logic of mathematics.  Statements about such matters reflect only the personal  preferences of a given individual. As Wittgenstein put it  in the famous last sentence of his work, “Of what one  cannot speak, of that one must keep silent. Logical empiricism,  which has remained dominant in England and  the United States to this day, drastically reduced the scope  of philosophical inquiry. Anxious people could find few,  if any, answers in this direction. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Some looked for answers in existentialism. Highly diverse  and even contradictory, existential thinkers were  loosely united in a courageous search for moral values in  a world of terror and uncertainty. Theirs were true voices  of the age of anxiety. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Most existential thinkers in the twentieth century were  atheists. Often inspired by Nietzsche, who had already  proclaimed the death of God and called for new values,  they did not believe a supreme being had established humanity’s  fundamental nature and given life its meaning.  In the words of the famous French existentialist Jean-Paul  Sartre (1905–1980), human beings simply exist: “They  turn up, appear on the scene. Only after they “turn up  do they seek to define themselves. Honest human beings  are terribly alone, for there is no God to help them. They  are hounded by despair and the meaninglessness of life.  The crisis of the existential thinker epitomized the modern  intellectual crisis—the shattering of beliefs in God,  reason, and progress. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Existentialists did recognize that human beings, unless  they kill themselves, must act. Indeed, in the words of  Sartre, “man is condemned to be free. There is therefore  the possibility—indeed, the necessity—of giving meaning  to life through actions, of defining oneself through choices.  To do so, individuals must become “engaged and choose  their own actions courageously and consistently and in full  awareness of their inescapable responsibility for their own  behavior. In the end, existentialists argued, human beings  can overcome life’s absurdity. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Modern existentialism first attained prominence in Germany  in the 1920s when philosophers Martin Heidegger  and Karl Jaspers found a sympathetic audience among disillusioned  postwar university students.

On the other,  men and women had more than ever to define themselves  by their actions. Specifically, each individual had to  choose whether to join the resistance against Hitler or  accept and even abet tyranny. The writings of Sartre, who  along with Albert Camus (1913–1960) was the leading  French existentialist, became enormously influential. Himself  active in the French resistance, Sartre and his colleagues  offered a powerful answer to profound moral issues and  the contemporary crisis. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Revival of Christianity "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The loss of faith in human reason and in continual progress  also led to a renewed interest in the Christian view of the  world. Christianity and religion in general had been on  the defensive in intellectual circles since the Enlightenment.  In the years before 1914, some theologians, especially  Protestant ones, had felt the need to interpret Christian  doctrine and the Bible so that they did not seem to contradict  science, evolution, and common sense. Christ was  therefore seen primarily as the greatest moral teacher, and  the “supernatural aspects of his divinity were strenuously  played down. Indeed, some modern theologians were embarrassed  by the miraculous, unscientific aspects of Christianity  and turned away from them. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Especially after World War I, a number of thinkers and  theologians began to revitalize the fundamentals of Christianity.  Sometimes described as Christian existentialists  because they shared the loneliness and despair of atheistic  existentialists, they stressed human beings’ sinful nature,  the need for faith, and the mystery of God’s forgiveness.  The revival of fundamental Christian belief after World  War I was fed by rediscovery of the work of nineteenth- century Danish religious philosopher Søren Kierkegaard  (1813–1855), whose ideas became extremely influential.  Having rejected formalistic religion, Kierkegaard had eventually  resolved his personal anguish over his imperfect nature  by making a total religious commitment to a remote  and majestic God. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Similar ideas were brilliantly developed by Swiss Protestant  theologian Karl Barth (1886–1968), whose many  influential writings after 1920 sought to re-create the religious  intensity of the Reformation. For Barth, the basic  fact about human beings is that they are imperfect, sinful  creatures whose reason and will are hopelessly flawed.  Religious truth is therefore made known to human beings  only through God’s grace. People have to accept God’s "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Among Catholics, the leading existential Christian  thinker was Gabriel Marcel (1887–1973). Born into a  cultivated French family, where his atheistic father was  “gratefully aware of all that ...art owed to Catholicism  but regarded Catholic thought itself as obsolete and tainted  with absurd superstitions,2 Marcel found in the Catholic  Church an answer to what he called the postwar “broken  world. Catholicism and religious belief provided the  hope, humanity, honesty, and piety for which he hungered.  Flexible and gentle, Marcel and his countryman  Jacques Maritain (1882–1973) denounced anti-Semitism  and supported closer ties with non-Catholics. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" After 1914 religion became much more relevant and  meaningful to thinking people than it had been before  the war. In addition to Marcel and Maritain, many other  illustrious individuals turned to religion between about  1920 and 1950. Poets T. S. Eliot and W. H. Auden, novelists  Evelyn Waugh and Aldous Huxley, historian Arnold  Toynbee, Oxford professor C. S. Lewis, psychoanalyst  Karl Stern, physicist Max Planck, and philosopher Cyril  Joad were all either converted to religion or attracted to  it for the first time. Religion, often of a despairing, existential  variety, was one meaningful answer to terror and  anxiety. In the words of a famous Roman Catholic convert,  English novelist Graham Greene, “One began to  believe in heaven because one believed in hell.3 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The New Physics "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Ever since the scientific revolution of the seventeenth century,  scientific advances and their implications had greatly  influenced the beliefs of thinking people. By the late  nineteenth century, science was one of the main pillars  supporting Western society’s optimistic and rationalistic  view of the world. The Darwinian concept of evolution  had been accepted and assimilated in most intellectual  circles. Progressive minds believed that science, unlike  religion and philosophical speculation, was based on hard  facts and controlled experiments. Science seemed to have  achieved an unerring and almost complete picture of  reality. Unchanging natural laws seemed to determine  physical processes and permit useful solutions to more  and more problems. All this was comforting, especially  to people who were no longer committed to traditional  religious beliefs. And all this was challenged by the  new physics. "}

In 1905 the German-Jewish genius  Albert Einstein (1879–1955)  went further than the Curies and  Planck in undermining Newtonian  physics. His famous theory of special  relativity postulated that time  and space are relative to the viewpoint  of the observer and that only  the speed of light is constant for all  frames of reference in the universe.  In order to make his revolutionary  and paradoxical idea somewhat  comprehensible to the nonmathematical  layperson, Einstein later used  analogies involving moving trains.  For example, if a woman in the  middle of a moving car got up and  walked forward to the door, she  had gone, relative to the train, a  half car length. But relative to an  observer on the embankment, she  had gone farther. The closed framework  of Newtonian physics was  quite limited compared to that of  Einsteinian physics, which unified an  apparently infinite universe with  the incredibly small, fast-moving  subatomic world. Moreover, Einstein’s  theory stated clearly that  matter and energy are interchangeable  and that even a particle of matter  contains enormous levels of  potential energy.  The 1920s opened the “heroic  age of physics, in the apt words of  one of its leading pioneers, Ernest  Rutherford (1871–1937). Breakthrough  followed breakthrough. In  1919 Rutherford showed that the  atom could be split. By 1944 seven  subatomic particles had been identified,  of which the most important "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 919  was the neutron. The neutron’s capacity to pass  through other atoms allowed for even more intense  experimental bombardment of matter, leading  to chain reactions of unbelievable force. This  was the road to the atomic bomb. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Although few nonscientists understood this  revolution in physics, the implications of the new  theories and discoveries, as presented by newspapers  and popular writers, were disturbing to millions  of men and women in the 1920s and  1930s. The new universe was strange and troubling.  It lacked any absolute objective reality.  Everything was “relative, that is, dependent on  the observer’s frame of reference. Moreover, the  universe was uncertain and undetermined, without  stable building blocks. In 1927 German  physicist Werner Heisenberg (1901–1976) formulated  the “principle of uncertainty, which  postulates that because it is impossible to know  the position and speed of an individual electron,  it is therefore impossible to predict its behavior.  Instead of Newton’s dependable, rational laws,  there seemed to be only tendencies and probabilities  in an extraordinarily complex and uncertain  universe. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Freudian Psychology "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Moreover, a universe described by abstract  mathematical symbols seemed to have little to do  with human experience and human problems.  When, for example, Planck was asked what science  could contribute to resolving conflicts of  values, his response was simple: “Science is not  qualified to speak to this question. Physics, the  queen of the sciences, no longer provided people  easy, optimistic answers—for that matter, it did  not provide any answers at all. "}

Thus after the First  World War, the popular interpretation of Freud reflected  and encouraged growing sexual experimentation, particularly  among middle-class women. For more serious students,  the psychology of Freud and his followers drastically  undermined the old, easy optimism about the rational and  progressive nature of the human mind. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Twentieth-Century Literature "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The general intellectual climate of pessimism, relativism,  and alienation was also articulated in literature. Novelists  developed new techniques to express new realities. The  great nineteenth-century novelists had typically written  as all-knowing narrators, describing realistic characters  and their relationship to an understandable, if sometimes  harsh, society. In the twentieth century, most major writers  adopted the limited, often confused viewpoint of a  single individual. Like Freud, these novelists focused their  attention on the complexity and irrationality of the human  mind, where feelings, memories, and desires are forever  scrambled. The great French novelist Marcel Proust  (1871–1922), in his semi-autobiographical ?E  ????T  (1913–1927), recalled bittersweet memories  of childhood and youthful love and tried to discover  their innermost meaning. To do so, Proust lived like a  hermit in a soundproof Paris apartment for ten years, withdrawing  from the present to dwell on the past. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Serious novelists also used the stream-of-consciousness  technique to explore the psyche. In ????M  (1922),  Virginia Woolf (1882–1941) created a novel made up  of a series of internal monologues, in which ideas and  emotions from different periods of time bubble up as  randomly as from a patient on a psychoanalyst’s couch.

Into an account of an ordinary day  in the life of an ordinary man, Joyce weaves an extended  ironic parallel between his hero’s aimless wanderings  through the streets and pubs of Dublin and the  adventures of Homer’s hero Ulysses on his way home  from Troy. Abandoning conventional grammar and blending  foreign words, puns, bits of knowledge, and scraps of  memory together in bewildering confusion, the language  of ?S  is intended to mirror modern life itself: a gigantic  riddle waiting to be unraveled. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As creative writers turned their attention from society  to the individual and from realism to psychological relativity,  they rejected the idea of progress. Some even described  “anti-utopias, nightmare visions of things to  come. In 1918 an obscure German high school teacher  named Oswald Spengler (1880–1936) published ???E  ???  ?T  which quickly became an international  sensation. According to Spengler, every culture experiences  a life cycle of growth and decline. Western civilization,  in Spengler’s opinion, was in its old age, and death  was approaching in the form of conquest by the yellow  race. T. S. Eliot (1888–1965), in his famous poem ?E  ???D  (1922), depicts a world of growing desolation,  although after his conversion to Anglo-Catholicism  in 1927, Eliot came to hope cautiously for humanity’s  salvation. No such hope appears in the work of Franz  Kafka (1883–1924), whose novels ???L  (1925) and  ????(1926), as well as several of his greatest short  stories, portray helpless individuals crushed by inexplicably  hostile forces.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Modernism in the arts was loosely unified by a revolution  in architecture. This revolution intended nothing less  than a transformation of the physical framework of urban  society according to a new principle: functionalism.  Buildings, like industrial products, should be useful and  “functional—that is, they should serve, as well as possible,  the purpose for which they were made. Thus architects  and designers had to work with engineers, town  planners, and even sanitation experts. Moreover, they had  to throw away useless ornamentation and find beauty and  aesthetic pleasure in the clean lines of practical constructions  and efficient machinery. Franco-Swiss genius Le Corbusier  (1887–1965) insisted that “a house is a machine  for living in.5 "}

The musical notes in a given piece  were no longer united and organized by a key; instead  they were independent and unrelated. Schönberg’s twelve- tone music of the 1920s arranged all twelve notes of the  scale in an abstract, mathematical pattern, or “tone row.  This pattern sounded like no pattern at all to the ordinary  listener and could be detected only by a highly trained  eye studying the musical score. Accustomed to the harmonies  of classical and romantic music, audiences generally  resisted modern atonal music. Only after the Second  World War did it begin to win acceptance. "}

Until after World War II at the earliest, these revolutionary  changes in art and music appealed mainly to a minority  of “highbrows and not to the general public.

The long-declining traditional  arts and amusements of people in villages and small towns  almost vanished, replaced by standardized, commercial  entertainment. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Moving pictures were first shown as a popular novelty  in naughty peepshows—“What the Butler Saw—and  penny arcades in the 1890s, especially in Paris. The first  movie houses date from an experiment in Los Angeles in  1902. They quickly attracted large audiences and led to  the production of short, silent action films such as the  eight-minute ?????Y  of 1903.

In the 1920s, Mack Sennett (1884–1960) and his  zany Keystone Kops specialized in short, slapstick comedies  noted for frantic automobile chases, custard-pie battles, and  gorgeous bathing beauties. Screen stars such as Mary  Pickford and Lillian Gish, Douglas Fairbanks and Rudolf  Valentino, became household names, with their own “fan  clubs. Yet Charlie Chaplin (1889–1978), a funny little  Englishman working in Hollywood, was unquestionably  the king of the “silver screen in the 1920s. In his enormously  popular role as the lonely Little Tramp, complete  with baggy trousers, battered derby, and an awkward, shuffling  walk, Chaplin symbolized the “gay spirit of laughter  in a cruel, crazy world.8 Chaplin also demonstrated that in  the hands of a genius, the new medium could combine  mass entertainment and artistic accomplishment.

The greatest appeal of motion pictures was that  they offered ordinary people a temporary escape from the  hard realities of everyday life.

{"prompt":"","completion":" The pursuit of real and lasting peace proved difficult for  many reasons. Germany hated the Treaty of Versailles.  France was fearful and isolated. Britain was undependable,  and the United States had turned its back on European  problems. Eastern Europe was in ferment, and no one  could predict the future of communist Russia. Moreover,  the international economic situation was poor and greatly  complicated by war debts and disrupted patterns of trade.  Yet for a time, from 1925 to late 1929, it appeared that  peace and stability were within reach. When the subsequent  collapse of the 1930s mocked these hopes and  brought the rise of brutal dictators, the disillusionment of  liberals in the democracies was intensified. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Germany was the key to lasting peace. Yet to Germans of  all political parties, the Treaty of Versailles represented a  harsh, dictated peace, to be revised or repudiated as soon  as possible. The treaty had neither broken nor reduced  Germany, which was potentially still the strongest country  in Europe. Thus the treaty had fallen between two  stools: too harsh for a peace of reconciliation, too soft for  a peace of conquest. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Moreover, with ominous implications for the future,  France and Great Britain did not see eye to eye on Germany.  By the end of 1919, France wanted to stress the  harsh elements in the Treaty of Versailles. Most of the war  in the west had been fought on French soil, and the expected  costs of reconstruction, as well as repaying war  debts to the United States, were staggering. Thus French  politicians believed that massive reparations from Germany  were a vital economic necessity. Also, having compromised  with President Wilson only to be betrayed by  America’s failure to ratify the treaty, many French leaders  saw strict implementation of all provisions of the Treaty of  Versailles as France’s last best hope. Large reparation payments  could hold Germany down indefinitely, and France  would realize its goal of security. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The British soon felt differently. Prewar Germany had  been Great Britain’s second-best market in the entire world,  and after the war a healthy, prosperous Germany appeared  to be essential to the British economy.

Facing possible occupation of more of its territory, the  young German republic—generally known as the Weimar  Republic—made its first payment in 1921. Then in 1922,  wracked by rapid inflation and political assassinations and  motivated by hostility and arrogance as well, the Weimar  Republic announced its inability to pay more. It proposed  a moratorium on reparations for three years, with the  clear implication that thereafter reparations would be either  drastically reduced or eliminated entirely. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The British were willing to accept a moratorium on reparations,  but the French were not. Led by their tough- minded prime minister, Raymond Poincaré (1860–1934),  they decided they had to either call Germany’s bluff or see  the entire peace settlement dissolve to France’s great disadvantage.  So, despite strong British protests, in early January  1923, armies of France and its ally Belgium moved out of  the Rhineland and began to occupy the Ruhr district, the  heartland of industrial Germany, creating the most serious  international crisis of the 1920s.

But with Russia hostile and  communist, and with Britain and the United States unwilling  to make any firm commitments, France turned to  the newly formed states of eastern Europe for diplomatic  support.

Thus after five long years of hostility and tension,  culminating in a kind of undeclared war in the Ruhr in  1923, Germany and France decided to give compromise  and cooperation a try.

Germany’s yearly  reparations were reduced and depended on the level of  German economic prosperity. Germany would also receive  large loans from the United States to promote German  recovery. In short, Germany would get private loans  from the United States and pay reparations to France and  Britain, thus enabling those countries to repay the large  sums they owed the United States. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This circular flow of international payments was complicated  and risky, but for a while it worked. The German  republic experienced a spectacular economic recovery.  With prosperity and large, continual inflows of American  capital, Germany easily paid about $1.3 billion in reparations  in 1927 and 1928, enabling France and Britain to  pay the United States. In this way the Americans belatedly  played a part in the general economic settlement  that, though far from ideal, facilitated the worldwide recovery  of the late 1920s. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This economic settlement was matched by a political  settlement. In 1925 the leaders of Europe signed  a number of agreements at Locarno, Switzerland.

His parents were  Berlin innkeepers and retailers of bottled beer, and only  Gustav of their five children was able to attend high  school. Attracted first to literature and history, Stresemann  later turned to economics, earned a doctoral degree,  and quickly reached the top as a manager and  director of German trade associations. A highly intelligent  extrovert with a knack for negotiation, Stresemann  entered the Reichstag in 1907 as a business-oriented  liberal and nationalist. When World War I erupted, he  believed, like most Germans, that Germany had acted  defensively and was not at fault. He emerged as a strident  nationalist and urged German annexation of conquered  foreign territories. Germany’s collapse in defeat and  revolution devastated Stresemann. He seemed a prime  candidate for the hateful extremism of the far right. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Yet although Stresemann opposed the Treaty of  Versailles as an unjust and unrealistic imposition, he  turned back toward the center. He accepted the new  Weimar Republic and played a growing role in the  Reichstag as the leader of his own small probusiness  party. His hour came in the Ruhr crisis, when French  and Belgian troops occupied the district. Named chancellor  in August 1923, he called off passive resistance  and began talks with the French. His government also  quelled communist uprisings; put down rebellions in  Bavaria, including Hitler’s attempted coup; and ended  runaway inflation with a new currency. Stresemann  fought to preserve German unity, and he succeeded. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Voted out as chancellor in November 1923, Stresemann  remained as foreign minister in every government  until his death in 1929. Proclaiming a policy of peace  and agreeing to pay reparations, he achieved his greatest  triumph in the Locarno agreements of 1925 (see page  930). But the interlocking guarantees of existing French  and German borders (and the related agreements to  resolve peacefully all disputes with Poland and Czechoslovakia)  did not lead the French to make any further  concessions that might have disarmed Stresemann’s  extremist foes.

His unwillingness to guarantee  Germany’s eastern borders (see Map 27.4 on page  904), which is often criticized, reflects his conviction  that keeping some Germans under Polish and  Czechoslovak rule created a ticking time bomb in Europe.  Stresemann was no less convinced that war on  Poland would almost certainly re-create the Allied  coalition that had crushed Germany in 1918.* His  insistence on the necessity of peace in the east as well  as the west was prophetic.

{"prompt":"","completion":" The situation in France had numerous similarities to  that in Germany. Communists and Socialists battled for  the support of the workers. After 1924 the democratically  elected government rested mainly in the hands of coalitions  of moderates, and business interests were well  represented. France’s great accomplishment was rapid rebuilding  of its war-torn northern region. The expense of  this undertaking led, however, to a large deficit and substantial  inflation. By early 1926, the franc had fallen to 10  percent of its prewar value, causing a severe crisis. Poincaré  was recalled to office, while Briand remained minister for  foreign affairs. The Poincaré government proceeded to  slash spending and raise taxes, restoring confidence in the  economy. The franc was “saved, stabilized at about one- fifth of its prewar value.

Committed to  the kind of moderate, “revisionist socialism that had  emerged before World War I (see pages 840–842), the  Labour Party replaced the Liberal Party as the main opposition  to the Conservatives. The new prominence of the  Labour Party reflected the decline of old liberal ideals of  competitive capitalism, limited government control, and  individual responsibility. In 1924 and 1929, the Labour  Party under Ramsay MacDonald (1866–1937) governed  the country with the support of the smaller Liberal Party.  Yet Labour moved toward socialism gradually and democratically,  so that the middle classes were not overly frightened  as the working classes won new benefits. "}

The  last line of Baldwin’s greatest speech in March 1925 summarized  his international and domestic programs: “Give us  peace in our time, O Lord. In spite of such conflicts as the  1926 strike by hard-pressed coal miners, which ended in  an unsuccessful general strike, social unrest in Britain was  limited in the 1920s and in the 1930s as well. In 1922  Britain granted southern, Catholic Ireland full autonomy  after a bitter guerrilla war, thereby removing another  source of prewar friction.

{"prompt":"","completion":" There is no agreement among historians and economists  about why the Great Depression was so deep and lasted  so long. Thus it is best to trace the course of the great  collapse before trying to identify what caused it. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Though economic activity was already declining moderately  in many countries by early 1929, the crash of the  stock market in the United States in October of that year  triggered the collapse into the Great Depression. The  American economy had prospered in the late 1920s, but  there were large inequalities in income and a serious imbalance  between “real investment and stock market  speculation. Thus net investment—in factories, farms,  equipment, and the like—actually fell from $3.5 billion  in 1925 to $3.2 billion in 1929. In the same years, as  money flooded into stocks, the value of shares traded on  the exchanges soared from $27 billion to $87 billion. As  a financial historian concluded in an important study, “It  should have been clear to everybody concerned that a  crash was inevitable under such conditions.11 Of course  it was not. Irving Fisher, one of America’s most brilliant  economists, was highly optimistic in 1929 and fully invested  in stocks. He then lost his entire fortune and would  have been forced from his house if his university had not  bought it and rented it to him. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The American stock market boom was built on borrowed  money. Many wealthy investors, speculators, and  people of modest means had bought stocks by paying  only a small fraction of the total purchase price and borrowing  the remainder from their stockbrokers. Such buying  “on margin was extremely dangerous. When prices  started falling, the hard-pressed margin buyers either had  to put up more money, which was often impossible, or  sell their shares to pay off their brokers. Thus thousands  of people started selling all at once. The result was a financial  panic. Countless investors and speculators were  wiped out in a matter of days or weeks. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The general economic consequences were swift and severe.  Stripped of wealth and confidence, battered investors  and their fellow citizens started buying fewer goods.

{"prompt":"","completion":" 935  The financial panic in the United States triggered a  worldwide financial crisis. Throughout the 1920s, American  bankers and investors had lent large amounts of  capital to many countries. Many of these loans were short- term, and once panic broke, New York bankers began recalling  them. Gold reserves thus began to flow out of  European countries, particularly Germany and Austria,  toward the United States. It became very hard for European  business people to borrow money, and the panicky  public began to withdraw its savings from the banks. These  banking problems eventually led to the crash of the largest  bank in Austria in 1931 and then to general financial  chaos. The recall of private loans by American bankers  also accelerated the collapse in world prices, as business  people around the world dumped industrial goods and  agricultural commodities in a frantic attempt to get cash  to pay what they owed.

{"prompt":"","completion":" The financial crisis led to a general crisis of production:  between 1929 and 1933, world output of goods fell by  an estimated 38 percent. As this happened, each country  turned inward and tried to go it alone. In 1931, for example,  Britain went off the gold standard, refusing to convert  bank notes into gold, and reduced the value of its money.  Britain’s goal was to make its goods cheaper and therefore  more salable in the world market. But because more than  twenty nations, including the United States in 1934, also  went off the gold standard, few countries gained a real advantage.  Similarly, country after country followed the example  of the United States when in 1930 it raised protective  tariffs to their highest levels ever and tried to seal off  shrinking national markets for American producers only.  Within this context of fragmented and destructive economic  nationalism, recovery finally began in 1933. "}

"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Although opinions differ, two factors probably best explain  the relentless slide to the bottom from 1929 to  early 1933. First, the international economy lacked a  leadership able to maintain stability when the crisis came.  Specifically, as a noted American economic historian concluded,  the seriously weakened British, the traditional  leaders of the world economy, “couldn’t and the United  States wouldn’t stabilize the international economic  system in 1929.12 The United States, which had momentarily  played a positive role after the occupation of the  Ruhr, cut back its international lending and erected high  tariffs. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The second factor was poor national economic policy  in almost every country. Governments generally cut their  budgets and reduced spending when they should have run  large deficits in an attempt to stimulate their economies.  After World War II, such a “counter-cyclical policy, advocated  by John Maynard Keynes, became a well-established  weapon against downturn and depression. But in the  1930s, Keynes’s prescription was generally regarded with  horror by orthodox economists. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Mass Unemployment "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The need for large-scale government spending was tied  to mass unemployment. As the financial crisis led to  cuts in production, workers lost their jobs and had little  money to buy goods. In Britain unemployment had averaged  12 percent in the 1920s; between 1930 and 1935,  it averaged more than 18 percent. Far worse was the case  of the United States, where unemployment had averaged  only 5 percent in the 1920s. In 1932 unemployment  soared to about 33 percent of the entire labor force: 14  million people were out of work (see Map 28.1). Only by  pumping new money into the economy could the government  increase demand and break the vicious cycle  of decline. "}

He and his “brain trust  of advisers adopted policies echoing the American experience  in World War I, when the American economy had  been thoroughly planned and regulated. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Innovative programs promoted agricultural recovery, a  top priority. Almost half of the American population still  lived in rural areas, and American farmers were hard hit  by the depression. Roosevelt’s decision to leave the gold  standard and devalue the dollar was designed to raise American  prices and rescue farmers. The Agricultural Adjustment  Act of 1933 also aimed at raising prices and farm  income by limiting production. These planning measures  worked for a while, and farmers repaid Roosevelt in 1936  with overwhelming support. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Relief programs like the WPA were part of the New  Deal’s most fundamental commitment, the commitment  to use the federal government to provide for the welfare  of all Americans.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Other social measures aimed in the same direction.  Following the path blazed by Germany’s Bismarck in the  1880s, the U.S. government in 1935 established a national  social security system, with old-age pensions and  unemployment benefits, to protect many workers against  some of life’s uncertainties. The National Labor Relations  Act of 1935 gave union organizers the green light  by declaring collective bargaining to be the policy of the  United States. Union membership more than doubled,  from 4 million in 1935 to 9 million in 1940. In general,  between 1935 and 1938 government rulings and social  reforms chipped away at the privileges of the wealthy and  tried to help ordinary people. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Yet despite undeniable accomplishments in social reform,  the New Deal was only partly successful as a response  to the Great Depression. At the height of the  recovery in May 1937, 7 million workers were still unemployed,  as opposed to a high of 15 million in 1933.  The economic situation then worsened seriously in the  recession of 1937 and 1938, and unemployment was still  a staggering 10 million when war broke out in Europe in  September 1939.

All this spending  required a large bureaucracy and high taxes, first on  the rich and then on practically everyone. Yet both private  and cooperative enterprise thrived, as did democracy.

Economic stagnation  both reflected and heightened an ongoing political  crisis. There was no stability in government. As before  1914, the French parliament was made up of many political  parties, which could never cooperate for very long. In  1933, for example, five coalition cabinets formed and fell  in rapid succession. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The French lost the underlying unity that had made  government instability bearable before 1914. Fascist-type  organizations agitated against parliamentary democracy  and looked to Mussolini’s Italy and Hitler’s Germany for  inspiration (see Chapter 29). In February 1934, French  fascists and semifascists rioted and threatened to overturn  the republic. At the same time, the Communist Party and  many workers opposed to the existing system were looking  to Stalin’s Russia for guidance. The vital center of  moderate republicanism was sapped from both sides. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 939  Frightened by the growing strength of the fascists at  home and abroad, the Communists, the Socialists, and  the Radicals formed an alliance—the Popular Front—for  the national elections of May 1936. Their clear victory  reflected the trend toward polarization. The number of  Communists in the parliament jumped dramatically from  10 to 72, while the Socialists, led by Léon Blum, became  the strongest party in France, with 146 seats. The really  quite moderate Radicals slipped badly, and the conservatives  lost ground to the semifascists. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the next few months, Blum’s Popular Front government  made the first and only real attempt to deal  with the social and economic problems of the 1930s in  France. Inspired by Roosevelt’s New Deal, the Popular  Front encouraged the union movement and launched a  far-reaching program of social reform, complete with paid  vacations and a forty-hour workweek. Popular with workers  and the lower middle class, these measures were quickly  sabotaged by rapid inflation and cries of revolution from  fascists and frightened conservatives. Wealthy people  sneaked their money out of the country, labor unrest grew,  and France entered a severe financial crisis. Blum was  forced to announce a “breathing spell in social reform. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The fires of political dissension were also fanned by  civil war in Spain. Communists demanded that France  support the Spanish republicans, while many French conservatives  would gladly have joined Hitler and Mussolini  in aiding the attack of Spanish fascists. Extremism grew,  and France itself was within sight of civil war. Blum was  forced to resign in June 1937, and the Popular Front  quickly collapsed. An anxious and divided France drifted  aimlessly once again, preoccupied by Hitler and German  rearmament. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" After the First World War, Western society entered a complex  and difficult era—truly an age of anxiety. Intellectual  life underwent a crisis marked by pessimism, uncertainty,  and fascination with irrational forces. Ceaseless experimentation  and rejection of old forms characterized art and  music, while motion pictures and radio provided new,  standardized entertainment for the masses. Intellectual and  artistic developments that had been confined to small avantgarde  groups before 1914, along with the insecure state of  mind they expressed, gained wider currency. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Politics and economics were similarly disrupted. In the  1920s, political leaders groped to create an enduring  peace and rebuild the prewar prosperity, and for a brief  period late in the decade, they even seemed to have succeeded.  Then the Great Depression, growing out of the  complicated international financial system and the speculative  boom and bust in the U.S. stock market, shattered  that fragile stability. Uncertainty returned with redoubled  force in the 1930s. The international economy collapsed,  and unemployment struck millions worldwide. The  democracies turned inward as they sought to cope with  massive domestic problems and widespread disillusionment.  Generally speaking, they were not very successful,  although relief measures and social concern eased distress  and prevented revolutions in the leading Western nations.  The old liberal ideals of individual rights and responsibilities,  elected government, and economic freedom declined  and seemed outmoded to many. And in many countries of "}

Popularly elected govern- ments and basic civil liberties declined drastically in Europe.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Nazi armies were defeated by a great coalition, and today we want to  believe that the era of totalitarian dictatorship was a terrible accident, that  Stalin’s slave-labor camps and Hitler’s gas chambers “can’t happen  again.

The Khmer Rouge inflicted genocide on its people  in Kampuchea, and civil war in Bosnia and in Rwanda led to racially motivated  atrocities recalling the horrors of World War II.

Thus it is all the more vital that we understand Europe’s  era of brutal and aggressive dictatorship in order to guard against the possibility  of its recurrence in the future. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The era of dictatorship is a highly disturbing chapter in the history of  Western civilization. The key development was not only the resurgence  of authoritarian rule but also the rise of a particularly ruthless and dynamic  tyranny. This new kind of tyranny reached its full realization in the  Soviet Union and Nazi Germany in the 1930s. Stalin and Hitler mobilized  their peoples for enormous undertakings and ruled with unprecedented  severity.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Both conservative and radical dictatorships swept through  Europe in the 1920s and 1930s. Although these two types  of dictatorship shared some characteristics and sometimes  overlapped in practice, they were in essence profoundly  different. Conservative authoritarian regimes were an old  story in Europe. Radical, totalitarian dictatorships were a  new and frightening development. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" • What was the nature of radical totalitarian dictatorship,  and how did it differ from conservative authoritarianism?  Conservative Authoritarianism "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The traditional form of antidemocratic government in  European history was conservative authoritarianism. Like  Catherine the Great in Russia and Metternich in Austria,  the leaders of such governments tried to prevent major  changes that would undermine the existing social order.  To do so, they relied on obedient bureaucracies, vigilant  police departments, and trustworthy armies. Popular participation  in government was forbidden or limited to such  natural allies as landlords, bureaucrats, and high church  officials. Liberals, democrats, and socialists were persecuted  as subversive radicals, often finding themselves in  jail or exile. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Yet old-fashioned authoritarian governments were limited  in their power and in their objectives. They had neither  the ability nor the desire to control many aspects of  their subjects’ lives. Nor did they wish to do so. Preoccupied  with the goal of mere survival, these governments  largely limited their demands to taxes, army recruits, and  passive acceptance. As long as the people did not try to  change the system, they often had considerable personal  independence. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" After the First World War, this kind of authoritarian  government revived, especially in the less-developed eastern  part of Europe. There the parliamentary regimes that  had been founded on the wreckage of empires in 1918  fell one by one. By early 1938, only economically and socially  advanced Czechoslovakia remained true to liberal  political ideals. Conservative dictators also took over in  Spain and Portugal. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There were several reasons for this development.  These lands lacked a strong tradition of self-government,  with its necessary restraint and compromise. Moreover,  many of these new states, such as Yugoslavia, were torn  by ethnic conflicts that threatened their very existence.  Dictatorship appealed to nationalists and military leaders "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" as a way to repress such tensions and preserve national  unity. Large landowners and the church were still powerful  forces in these largely agrarian areas, and they often  looked to dictators to save them from progressive land  reform or communist agrarian upheaval. So did some members  of the middle class, which was small and weak in  eastern Europe. Finally, though some kind of democracy  managed to stagger through the 1920s in Austria, Bulgaria,  Romania, Greece, Estonia, and Latvia, the Great  Depression delivered the final blow to those countries  by 1936. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Although some of the conservative authoritarian regimes  adopted certain Hitlerian and fascist characteristics in the  1930s, their general aims were limited. They were concerned  more with maintaining the status quo than with  forcing society into rapid change or war. This tradition  continued into the twenty-first century, especially in  some of the military dictatorships that ruled in Latin  America until the late 1980s. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Radical Totalitarian Dictatorships "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Conservative authoritarianism predominated in the smaller  states of central and eastern Europe by the mid-1930s,  but a new kind of radical dictatorship emerged in the  Soviet Union, Germany, and, to a lesser extent, Italy. Almost  all scholars agree that the leaders of these radical  dictatorships violently rejected parliamentary restraint and  liberal values. Scholars also agree that these dictatorships  exercised unprecedented control over the masses and  sought to mobilize them for action. However, there has  always been controversy over the interpretation of these  regimes. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" One extremely useful approach relates the radical dictatorships  to the rise of modern totalitarianism. The concept  of totalitarianism emerged in the 1920s and 1930s,  although it is frequently and mistakenly seen as developing  only after 1945 as part of anti-Soviet propaganda during  the cold war. In 1924 Benito Mussolini spoke of the  “fierce totalitarian will of his movement in Italy. In the  1930s more and more British, American, and German exiled  writers used the concept of totalitarianism to describe  what they saw happening before their eyes. They linked  Italian and especially German fascism with Soviet communism  in “a ‘new kind of state’ that could be called totalitarian.  With the alliance between Hitler and Stalin in  1939, “all doubts about the totalitarian nature of both  dictatorships “were swept away for most Americans.1 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Early writers believed that modern totalitarian dictatorship  burst on the scene with the revolutionary total  war effort of 1914–1918. The war called forth a ten"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \f 947 947  dency to subordinate all institutions and all classes to the  state in order to achieve one supreme objective: victory.  As the French thinker Elie Halévy put it in 1936 in his  influential The Era of Tyrannies, the varieties of modern  totalitarian tyranny—fascism, Nazism, and communism—  could be thought of as “feuding brothers with a common  father: the nature of modern war.2 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Writers such as Halévy believed that the crucial experience  of World War I was carried further by Lenin and the  Bolsheviks during the Russian civil war. Lenin showed how  a dedicated minority could achieve victory over a less determined  majority and subordinate institutions and human  rights to the needs of a single group—the Communist  Party—and its leader. Providing a model for single-party  dictatorship, Lenin inspired imitators, including Adolf  Hitler. The modern totalitarian state reached maturity in  the 1930s in the Stalinist U.S.S.R. and Nazi Germany. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Embellishing on early insights, numerous Western political  scientists and historians argued in the 1950s and  1960s that the totalitarian state used modern technology  and communications to exercise complete political power.  But it did not stop there. Increasingly, the state took over  and tried to control just as completely the economic, social,  intellectual, and cultural aspects of people’s lives. Deviation  from the norm, even in art or family behavior,  could become a crime. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This vision of total state represented a radical revolt  against liberalism. Classical liberalism (see page 753) sought  to limit the power of the state and protect the rights of the  individual. Moreover, liberals stood for rationality, peaceful  progress, economic freedom, and a strong middle class. All  of that disgusted totalitarians as sentimental slop. They believed  in willpower, preached conflict, and worshiped violence.  The individual was infinitely less valuable than the  state. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Unlike old-fashioned authoritarianism, modern totalitarianism  was based not on an elite but on people who  had already become engaged in the political process, most  notably through commitment to nationalism and socialism.  Thus totalitarian societies were fully mobilized societies  moving toward some goal and possessing boundless  dynamism. As soon as one goal was achieved at the cost of  enormous sacrifice, another arose at the leader’s command  to take its place. Thus totalitarianism was a permanent  revolution, an unfinished revolution, in which rapid,  profound change imposed from on high went on forever. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In developing the concept of totalitarianism, scholars  recognized that there were major differences between  Stalin’s communist U.S.S.R. and Hitler’s Nazi Germany.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Scholarly interest in fascism declined in the 1950s but  revived thereafter. Comparative studies of fascist movements  all across Europe showed that they shared many  characteristics, including extreme, often expansionist nationalism;  an antisocialism aimed at destroying working- class movements; alliances with powerful capitalists and  landowners; a dynamic and violent leader; and glorification  of war and the military. Yet these studies also highlighted  how fascist movements generally failed to gain  political power. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In recent years, many historians have tended to adopt "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" a third approach, emphasizing the uniqueness of developments  in each country. This is especially true for  Hitler’s Germany, where some elements of the totalitarian  interpretation have been nuanced and revised, as we  shall see. A similar revaluation of Stalin’s U.S.S.R. began  after the fall of communism opened the former Soviet  Union’s archives to new research. For many of today’s  historians, the differences within broad historical patterns  often seem more important than the similarities. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In summary, these conclusions seem appropriate. First,  although the concept of totalitarianism has been questioned,  it remains a valuable tool for historical understanding.  It correctly highlights that both Hitler’s Germany and  Stalin’s Soviet Union made an unprecedented “total claim  on the belief and behavior of their respective citizens, as a "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \f noted scholar has recently concluded.3 Second, antidemocratic,  antisocialist fascist movements sprang up all over  Europe, but only in Italy and Germany (and some would  say Spain) were they able to take power. Studies of fascist  movements seeking to gain power locate important common  elements, but they do not explain what fascist governments  in Italy and Germany actually did. Finally, it  is important to remember that the problem of Europe’s  radical dictatorships is complex and that there are few easy  answers. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Lenin’s harshest critics claim that he established the basic  outlines of a modern totalitarian dictatorship after the  Bolshevik Revolution and during the Russian civil war. If  this is so, then Joseph Stalin (1879–1953) certainly finished  the job. A master of political infighting, Stalin cautiously  consolidated his power and eliminated his enemies  in the mid-1920s. Then in 1928, as undisputed leader of  the ruling Communist Party, he launched the first five- year plan—the “revolution from above, as he so aptly  termed it. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The five-year plans were extremely ambitious. Often incorrectly  considered a mere set of economic measures  to speed up the Soviet Union’s industrial development,  the five-year plans actually marked the beginning of a renewed  attempt to mobilize and transform Soviet society  along socialist lines. The ultimate goal of the plans was to  generate new attitudes, new loyalties, and a new socialist  humanity. The means Stalin and the small Communist  Party elite chose in order to do so were constant propaganda,  enormous sacrifice by the people, and the concentration  of all power in party hands. Thus the Soviet Union  in the 1930s became a dynamic, modern totalitarian state. "}

Many farms were in ruins, and food supplies were exhausted.  In southern Russia, drought combined with the  ravages of war to produce the worst famine in generations.  Industrial production also broke down completely. The  Bolsheviks had destroyed the economy as well as their foes. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Stalin’s Soviet Union • "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 949  Bolshevik sailors at Kronstadt, the tough but ever-flexible  Lenin changed course. In March 1921, he announced  the New Economic Policy (NEP), which re-established  limited economic freedom in an attempt to rebuild agriculture  and industry. During the civil war, the Bolsheviks had  simply seized grain without payment. Now peasant producers  were permitted to sell their surpluses in free markets,  and private traders and small handicraft manufacturers  were allowed to reappear. Heavy industry, railroads, and  banks, however, remained wholly nationalized. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The NEP was shrewd and successful both politically  and economically. Politically, it was a necessary but temporary  compromise with the Soviet Union’s overwhelming  peasant majority. Realizing that his government was not  strong enough to take land from the peasants and turn  them into state workers, Lenin made a deal with the only  force capable of overturning his government. Economically,  the NEP brought rapid recovery. In 1926 industrial  output surpassed the level of 1913, and Soviet peasants  were producing almost as much grain as before the war. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As the economy recovered and the government partially  relaxed its censorship and repression, an intense  struggle for power began in the inner circles of the Communist  Party, for Lenin had left no chosen successor  when he died in 1924. The principal contenders were the  stolid Stalin and the flamboyant Trotsky. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The son of a shoemaker, Joseph Dzhugashvili—later  known as Stalin—studied for the priesthood but was expelled  from his theological seminary, probably for rude  rebelliousness. By 1903 he was a Bolshevik revolutionary  in southern Russia. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Stalin was a good organizer but a poor speaker and  writer, with no experience outside of Russia. Trotsky, a  great and inspiring leader who had planned the 1917  takeover (see page 898) and then created the victorious  Red Army, appeared to have all the advantages. Yet it was  Stalin who succeeded Lenin. Stalin won because he was  more effective at gaining the all-important support of the  party, the only genuine source of power in the one-party  state. Rising to general secretary of the party’s Central  Committee just before Lenin’s first stroke in 1922, Stalin  used his office to win friends and allies with jobs and  promises. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The practical Stalin also won because he appeared better  able than the brilliant Trotsky to relate Marxian teaching  to Soviet realities in the 1920s.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Domestically, there was the problem of the peasants.  For centuries the peasants had wanted to own the land,  and finally they had it. Sooner or later, the communists  reasoned, the peasants would become conservative little  capitalists and pose a threat to the regime. At the same  time, the mainly urban communists believed that the  feared and despised “class enemy in the villages could  be squeezed to provide the enormous sums needed for  all-out industrialization. Thus Stalin decided on a war  against the peasantry in order to bring it under the control  of the state and to make it pay the costs of the new  socialist offensive. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" That war was collectivization—the forcible consolida"}

Beginning in 1929, peasants all over the Soviet  Union were ordered to give up their land and animals  and become members of collective farms, although  they continued to live in their own homes. As for the  kulaks, the better-off peasants, Stalin instructed party  workers to “liquidate them as a class. Stripped of land  and livestock, the kulaks were generally not even permitted  to join the collective farms. Many starved or were deported  to forced-labor camps for “re-education. "}

Large numbers of peasants slaughtered  their animals and burned their crops in sullen,  hopeless protest. Between 1929 and 1933, the number  of horses, cattle, sheep, and goats in the Soviet Union  fell by at least half. Nor were the state-controlled collective  farms more productive. The output of grain barely  increased between 1928 and 1938. Collectivized agriculture  was unable to make any substantial financial contribution  to Soviet industrial development in the first  five-year plan. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The human dimension of the tragedy was absolutely  staggering. As one leading historian writes in outrage,  “The number dying in Stalin’s war against the peasants  was higher than the total deaths of all the countries in  World War I.

{"prompt":"","completion":" In Ukraine the drive against peasants snowballed into  a general assault on Ukrainians as reactionary nationalists  and enemies of socialism. Thus in 1932, as collectivization  and deportations continued, Stalin and his associates  set levels of grain deliveries for the Ukrainian collective at  excessively high levels, and they refused to relax those  quotas or even allow food relief when Ukrainian communist  leaders reported that starvation was occurring. The  result was a terrible man-made famine in Ukraine in  1932 and 1933, which probably claimed 6 million lives. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Collectivization, justly called the “second serfdom,  was a cruel but real victory for communist ideologues. By  the end of 1932, fully 60 percent of peasant families had  been herded onto collective farms; by 1938, 93 percent.  Regimented as employees of the state and dependent on  the state-owned tractor stations, the collectivized peasants  were no longer even a potential political threat to  Stalin and the Communist Party. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Peasants fought back with indirect daily opposition  and forced the supposedly all-powerful state to make  modest compromises. Peasants secured the right to limit  a family’s labor on the state-run farms and to cultivate  tiny family plots, which provided them with much of  their food. In 1938 these family plots produced 22 per"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" cent of all Soviet agricultural produce on only 4 percent  of all cultivated land. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The industrial side of the five-year plans was more  successful—indeed, quite spectacular. Soviet industry produced  about four times as much in 1937 as it had in  1928. No other major country had ever achieved such  rapid industrial growth. Heavy industry led the way; consumer  industry grew quite slowly. A new heavy industrial  complex was built almost from scratch in western Siberia.  Industrial growth also went hand in hand with urban development,  and more than 25 million people migrated to  cities during the 1930s. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The great industrialization drive, concentrated between  1928 and 1937, was an awe-inspiring achievement purchased  at enormous sacrifice. The sudden creation of dozens  of new factories required a great increase in total investment.  The money for investment was collected from the  people by means of heavy, hidden sales taxes. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Two other factors contributed importantly to rapid industrialization:  firm labor discipline and foreign engineers.  Between 1930 and 1932, trade unions lost most of their  power. The government could assign workers to any job  anywhere in the country, and individuals could not move  without the permission of the police. When factory managers  needed more hands, they called on their counterparts  on the collective farms, who sent them millions of  “unneeded peasants over the years. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Foreign engineers were hired to plan and construct  many of the new factories. Highly skilled American engineers,  hungry for work in the depression years, were particularly  important until newly trained Soviet experts began  to replace them after 1932. The gigantic mills of the new  Siberian steel industry were modeled on America’s best.  Thus Stalin’s planners harnessed even the skill and technology  of capitalist countries to promote the surge of socialist  industry. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Life and Culture in Soviet Society "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The aim of Stalin’s five-year plans was to create a new  kind of society and human personality as well as a strong  industrial economy and a powerful army. Stalin and his  helpers were good Marxian economic determinists. Once  everything was owned by the state, they believed, a socialist  society and a new kind of human being would inevitably  emerge. Their utopian vision of a new humanity  floundered, but they did build a new society, whose broad  outlines existed into the mid-1980s. Life in this society  had both good and bad aspects. "}

Indeed, the most careful studies show that the  average nonfarm wage apparently purchased only about  half as many goods in 1932 as in 1928. After 1932 real  wages rose slowly, so that in 1937 workers could buy  about 60 percent of what they had bought in 1928  and less than in 1913. Collectivized peasants experienced  greater declines. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Life was hard in Stalin’s Soviet Union. The masses of  people lived primarily on black bread and wore old, shabby  clothing. There were constant shortages in the stores, although  very heavily taxed vodka was always readily available.  A shortage of housing was a particularly serious  problem. Millions were moving into the cities, but the  government built few new apartments. A relatively lucky  family received one room for all its members and shared  both a kitchen and a toilet with others on the floor. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Life was hard but by no means hopeless. Idealism and  ideology had real appeal for many communists, who saw  themselves heroically building the world’s first socialist  society while capitalism crumbled in a worldwide depression  and degenerated into fascism in the West. This optimistic  belief in the future of the Soviet Union also  attracted many disillusioned Westerners to communism  in the 1930s. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The keys to improving one’s position were specialized  skills and technical education. Rapid industrialization required  massive numbers of trained experts, such as skilled  workers, engineers, and plant managers. Thus the Stalinist  state broke with the egalitarian policies of the 1920s  and provided tremendous incentives to those who could  serve its needs. It paid the mass of unskilled workers and  collective farmers very low wages, but it dangled high  salaries and many special privileges before its growing  technical and managerial elite. This elite joined with the  political and artistic elites in a new upper class, whose  members were rich, powerful, and insecure. Thus millions  struggled for an education. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The radical transformation of Soviet society had a profound  impact on women’s lives. Marxists had traditionally  believed that both capitalism and the middle-class husband  exploited women. The Russian Revolution of 1917 immediately  proclaimed complete equality of rights for women.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Soviet society also demanded great sacrifices from  women. The vast majority of women simply had to work  outside the home. Wages were so low that it was almost  impossible for a family or couple to live only on the husband’s  earnings. Men continued to dominate the very  best jobs. Finally, rapid change and economic hardship  led to many broken families, creating further physical and  emotional strains for women. In any event, the massive  mobilization of women was a striking characteristic of  the Soviet state. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Culture lost its autonomy in the 1930s and became  thoroughly politicized through constant propaganda and  indoctrination. Party activists lectured workers in factories  and peasants on collective farms, while newspapers,  films, and radio broadcasts endlessly recounted socialist  achievements and capitalist plots. Whereas the 1920s had  seen considerable experimentation in modern art and theater,  intellectuals were ordered by Stalin to become “engineers  of human minds. Writers and artists who could  effectively combine genuine creativity and political propaganda  became the darlings of the regime. It became increasingly  important for the successful writer and artist to  glorify Russian nationalism. Russian history was rewritten  so that early tsars such as Ivan the Terrible and Peter  the Great became worthy forerunners of the greatest Russian  leader of all—Stalin. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" In the mid-1930s, the great offensive to build  socialism and a new socialist personality culminated in  ruthless police terror and a massive purging of the Communist  Party. First used by the Bolsheviks in the civil war  to maintain their power, terror as state policy was revived  in the collectivization drive against the peasants.

Although Stalin himself probably ordered  Kirov’s murder, he used the incident to launch a reign  of terror. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In August 1936, sixteen prominent Old Bolsheviks  confessed to all manner of plots against Stalin in spectacular  public trials in Moscow. Then in 1937 the secret  police arrested a mass of lesser party officials and newer  members, also torturing them and extracting more confessions  for more show trials. In addition to the party  faithful, union officials, managers, intellectuals, army officers,  and countless ordinary citizens were struck down.  In all, at least 8 million people were probably arrested,  and millions of these were executed or never returned  from prisons and forced-labor camps. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Stalin and the remaining party leadership recruited 1.5  million new members to take the place of those purged.  Thus more than half of all Communist Party members in  1941 had joined since the purges. “These new men were  ‘thirty-something’ products of the Second Revolution of  the 1930s, Stalin’s upwardly mobile yuppies, so to speak.7  Often sons (and daughters) of workers, they had usually  studied in the new technical schools, and they soon proved  capable of managing the government and large-scale production.  A product of the great purges, this new generation  of Stalin-formed communists would serve the leader  effectively until his death in 1953, and they would govern  the Soviet Union until the early 1980s. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Stalin’s mass purges remain baffling, for almost all historians  believe that those purged posed no threat and  confessed to crimes they had not committed. Certainly  the highly publicized purges sent a warning to the people:  no one was secure; everyone had to serve the party and its  leader with redoubled devotion. Some Western scholars  have also argued that the terror reflected a fully developed  totalitarian state, which must always be fighting real or  imaginary enemies. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The long-standing Western interpretation that puts the  blame for the great purges on Stalin, which became very  popular in Russia after the fall of communism, has nevertheless  been challenged. Some historians argue that Stalin’s  fears were exaggerated but real. Moreover, these fears and  suspicions were shared by many in the party and in the  general population.

At the same time, Mussolini and his supporters were the  first to call themselves “fascists—revolutionaries determined  to create a certain kind of totalitarian state. Yet few  scholars today would argue that Mussolini succeeded.

{"prompt":"","completion":" The Seizure of Power "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the early twentieth century, Italy was a liberal state with  civil rights and a constitutional monarchy. On the eve  of the First World War, the parliamentary regime finally  granted universal male suffrage, and Italy appeared to be  moving toward democracy. But there were serious problems.  Much of the Italian population was still poor, and  many peasants were more attached to their villages and  local interests than to the national state. Moreover, the papacy,  many devout Catholics, conservatives, and landowners  remained strongly opposed to liberal institutions and  to the heirs of Cavour and Garibaldi—the middle-class  lawyers and politicians who ran the country largely for their  own benefit. Relations between church and state were often  tense. Class differences were also extreme, and a powerful  revolutionary socialist movement had developed. Only  in Italy among the main European countries did the radical  left wing of the Socialist Party gain the leadership as early as  1912, and only in Italy did the Socialist Party unanimously  oppose the war from the very beginning.9 "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" The Russian Revolution inspired and energized Italy’s  revolutionary socialist movement. The Socialist Party  quickly lined up with the Bolsheviks, and radical workers  and peasants began occupying factories and seizing land  in 1920. These actions scared and mobilized the property- owning classes. Moreover, after the war the pope  lifted his ban on participation by Catholics in Italian politics,  and a strong Catholic party quickly emerged. Thus  by 1921 revolutionary socialists, antiliberal conservatives,  and frightened property owners were all opposed—  though for different reasons—to the liberal parliamentary  government. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Into these crosscurrents of unrest and fear stepped  the blustering, bullying Benito Mussolini (1883–1945).  Son of a village schoolteacher and a poor blacksmith,  Mussolini began his political career as a Socialist Party  leader and radical newspaper editor before World War I.  In 1914, powerfully influenced by antidemocratic cults  of violent action, the young Mussolini urged that Italy  join the Allies, a stand for which he was expelled from  the Italian Socialist Party. Later Mussolini fought at the  front and was wounded in 1917. Returning home, he began  organizing bitter war veterans like himself into a  band of fascists—from the Italian word for “a union of  forces. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" At first Mussolini’s program was a radical combination  of nationalist and socialist demands, including territorial  expansion, benefits for workers, and land reform for peasants.  As such, it competed directly with the well-organized  Socialist Party and failed to get off the ground. When  Mussolini saw that his violent verbal assaults on rival Socialists  won him growing support from conservatives and  the frightened middle classes, he shifted gears in 1920. In  thought and action, Mussolini was a striking example of  the turbulent uncertainty of the age of anxiety. "}

Striking a conservative  note in his speeches and gaining the sympathetic  neutrality of army leaders, Mussolini demanded the resignation  of the existing government and his own appointment  by the king. In October 1922, to force matters, a large  group of fascists marched on Rome to threaten the king  and force him to call on Mussolini. The threat worked.  Victor Emmanuel III (r. 1900–1946), who had no love for  the old liberal politicians, asked Mussolini to form a new  cabinet.

Mussolini’s ministers, however, included old  conservatives, moderates, and even two reform-minded  Socialists. A new electoral law was passed giving two- thirds of the representatives in the parliament to the  party that won the most votes, a change that allowed the  Fascist Party and its allies to win an overwhelming majority  in 1924. Shortly thereafter, five of Mussolini’s thugs  kidnapped and murdered Giacomo Matteotti, the leader  of the Socialists in the parliament.

Freedom of  the press was abolished, elections were fixed, and the  government ruled by decree. Mussolini arrested his political  opponents, disbanded all independent labor unions,  and put dedicated Fascists in control of Italy’s schools.  Moreover, he created a fascist youth movement, fascist  labor unions, and many other fascist organizations. Mussolini  trumpeted his goal in a famous slogan of 1926:  “Everything in the state, nothing outside the state, nothing  against the state. By the end of that year, Italy was  a one-party dictatorship under Mussolini’s unquestioned  leadership. "}

It never destroyed the old power  structure, as the Communists did in the Soviet Union, or  succeeded in dominating it, as the Nazis did in Germany.  Membership in the Fascist Party was more a sign of an  Italian’s respectability than a commitment to radical change.  Interested primarily in personal power, Mussolini was content  to compromise with the old conservative classes that  controlled the army, the economy, and the state.

There was no land reform. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Although he moved to Munich in 1913 to avoid being  drafted in the Austrian army, the lonely Hitler greeted the  outbreak of the First World War as a salvation. He later  wrote in his autobiography, Mein Kampf, that, “overcome  by passionate enthusiasm, I fell to my knees and thanked  heaven out of an overflowing heart. The struggle and  discipline of war gave life meaning, and Hitler served  bravely as a dispatch carrier on the western front. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When Germany was suddenly defeated in 1918, Hitler’s  world was shattered. Not only was he a fanatical nationalist,  but war was also his reason for living. Convinced  that Jews and Marxists had “stabbed Germany in the  back, he vowed to fight on. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In late 1919, Hitler joined a tiny extremist group in  Munich called the German Workers’ Party. In addition to  denouncing Jews, Marxists, and democrats, the German  Workers’ Party promised unity under a uniquely German  “national socialism that would abolish the injustices of  capitalism and create a mighty “people’s community. By  1921 Hitler had gained absolute control of this small but  growing party. He was already a master of mass propaganda  and political showmanship. His most effective tool  was the mass rally, where he often worked his audience  into a frenzy with wild, demagogic attacks on the Versailles  treaty, the Jews, the war profiteers, and Germany’s  Weimar Republic.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Party membership multiplied tenfold after early 1922.  In late 1923, the Weimar Republic seemed on the verge  of collapse, and Hitler, inspired by Mussolini’s recent  easy victory, decided on an armed uprising in Munich.  Despite the failure of the poorly organized plot and Hitler’s  arrest, Nazism had been born. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hitler’s Road to Power "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" At his trial, Hitler violently denounced the Weimar Republic,  and he gained enormous publicity and attention.  Moreover, he learned from his unsuccessful revolt. Hitler  concluded that he had to undermine, rather than overthrow,  the government and come to power legally through  electoral competition. He forced his more violent supporters  to accept his new strategy. He also used his brief  prison term to dictate Mein Kampf. There he expounded  on his basic themes: “race, with a stress on anti-Semitism;  “living space, with a sweeping vision of war and conquered  territory; and the leader-dictator (Führer), with  unlimited, arbitrary power. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the years of prosperity and relative stability between  1924 and 1929, Hitler concentrated on building his National  Socialist German Workers’ Party, or Nazi Party. By  1928 the party had 100,000 highly disciplined members  under Hitler’s absolute control. To appeal to the middle- class voters, Hitler de-emphasized the anticapitalist  elements of national socialism and vowed to fight Bolshevism.  Yet the Nazis remained a small splinter group in  1928, when they received only 2.6 percent of the vote  in the general elections and twelve seats in the Reichstag.  There the Nazi deputies pursued the legal strategy of using  democracy to destroy democracy. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Great Depression, shattering economic prosperity  from 1929 on, presented Hitler with a fabulous opportunity.  Unemployment jumped from 1.3 million in 1929 to  5 million in 1930. By the end of 1932, an incredible 43  percent of the labor force was unemployed. Industrial  production fell by one-half between 1929 and 1932. No  factor contributed more to Hitler’s success than the economic  crisis. Never very interested in economics before,  Hitler began promising German voters economic as well  as political and international salvation. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Above all, Hitler rejected free-market capitalism and  advocated government programs to bring recovery. Hitler  pitched his speeches especially to middle- and lowermiddle- class groups—small business people, officeworkers,  artisans, and peasants—as well as to skilled workers  striving for middle-class status. Seized by panic as bankruptcies  increased, unemployment soared, and the Communists  made dramatic election gains, great numbers  of middle- and lower-middle-class people “voted their  pocketbooks10 and deserted the conservative and moderate  parties for the Nazis. In the election of 1930, the  Nazis won 6.5 million votes and 107 seats, and in July  1932 they gained 14.5 million votes—38 percent of the  total—and became the largest party in the Reichstag. "}

To arouse such hysterical fanaticism,  he believed that all propaganda had to be limited  to a few simple, endlessly repeated slogans. But now when  he harangued vast audiences with wild oratory and simple  slogans, he featured “national rebirth and the “crimes  of the Versailles treaty.

National recovery, exciting and  rapid change, and personal advancement were the appeals  of Nazism to millions of German youths. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Another reason Hitler came to power was that normal  democratic government broke down as early as May  1930. Unable to gain the support of a majority in the  Reichstag, Chancellor (chief minister) Heinrich Brüning  convinced the president, the aging war hero General  Hindenburg, to authorize rule by decree.

In complicated infighting in 1932, he  cleverly succeeded in gaining additional support from  key people in the army and big business. These people  thought they could use Hitler for their own advantage to  get increased military spending, fat contracts, and tough  measures against workers. Many conservative and nationalistic  politicians thought similarly. They thus accepted  Hitler’s demand to join the government only if he became  chancellor. There would be only two other National  Socialists and nine solid conservatives as ministers,  and in such a coalition government, they reasoned, Hitler  could be used and controlled. On January 30, 1933, Adolf  Hitler, leader of the largest party in Germany, was legally  appointed chancellor by Hindenburg. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Nazi State and Society "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hitler moved rapidly and skillfully to establish an unshakable  dictatorship. Continuing to maintain legal appearances,  he immediately called for new elections. In the  midst of a violent electoral campaign, the Reichstag  building was partly destroyed by fire. Hitler screamed  that the Communist Party was responsible, and he convinced  President Hindenburg to sign dictatorial emergency  acts that practically abolished freedom of speech  and assembly as well as most personal liberties. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When the Nazis won only 44 percent of the vote in the  elections, Hitler immediately outlawed the Communist  Party and arrested its parliamentary representatives. Then  on March 23, 1933, the Nazis pushed through the Reich- stag the so-called Enabling Act, which gave Hitler absolute  dictatorial power for four years. Armed with the Enabling  Act, Hitler and the Nazis moved to smash or control all independent  organizations. Their deceitful stress on legality,  coupled with divide-and-conquer techniques, disarmed the  opposition until it was too late for effective resistance. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Germany soon became a one-party state. Only the Nazi  Party was legal. Elections were farces. The Reichstag was  jokingly referred to as the most expensive glee club in the  country, for its only function was to sing hymns of praise to  the Führer.

Yet this fractured system  suited Hitler and his purposes. He could play the established  bureaucracy against his private, personal “party  government and maintain his freedom of action. Hitler  could concentrate on general principles and the big decisions,  which he always made. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the economic sphere, one big decision outlawed strikes  and abolished independent labor unions, which were replaced  by the Nazi Labor Front. Professional people—  doctors and lawyers, teachers and engineers—also saw  their previously independent organizations swallowed up  by Nazi associations. Publishing houses were put under  Nazi control, and universities and writers were quickly  brought into line. Democratic, socialist, and Jewish literature  was put on ever-growing blacklists. Passionate students  and pitiful professors burned forbidden books in  public squares. Modern art and architecture were ruthlessly  prohibited. Life became violently anti-intellectual.  By 1934 a brutal dictatorship characterized by frightening  dynamism and obedience to Hitler was already largely in  place. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Only the army retained independence, and Hitler moved  brutally and skillfully to establish his control there, too.  The Nazi storm troopers (the SA), the quasi-military band  of 3 million toughs in brown shirts who had fought communists  and beaten up Jews before the Nazis took power,  expected top positions in the army and even talked of a  “second revolution against capitalism. Hitler decided that  the SA leaders had to be eliminated. Needing to preserve  good relations with the army as well as with big business,  he struck on the night of June 30, 1934. Hitler’s elite  personal guard—the SS—arrested and shot without trial  roughly a thousand SA leaders and assorted political enemies.  Shortly thereafter army leaders swore a binding oath  of “unquestioning obedience . . . to the Leader of the German  State and People, Adolf Hitler. The SS grew rapidly.  Under its methodical, inhuman leader, Heinrich Himmler  (1900–1945), the SS joined with the political police, the  Gestapo, to expand its network of special courts and concentration  camps. Nobody was safe. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" From the beginning, Jews were a special object of Nazi  persecution. By the end of 1934, most Jewish lawyers, doctors,  professors, civil servants, and musicians had lost their  jobs and the right to practice their professions. In 1935 the  infamous Nuremberg Laws classified as Jewish anyone having  one or more Jewish grandparents and deprived Jews of  all rights of citizenship. By 1938 roughly 150,000 of Germany’s  half a million Jews had emigrated, sacrificing almost  all their property in order to leave Germany. "}

A well- organized wave of violence, known to history as “Kristallnacht,  smashed windows, looted shops, and destroyed  homes and synagogues. German Jews were then rounded  up and made to pay for the damage. Another 150,000 Jews  fled Germany. Some Germans privately opposed these outrages,  but most went along or looked the other way. This  lack of opposition reflected anti-Semitism to a degree still  being debated by historians, but it certainly reflected the  strong popular support Hitler’s government enjoyed. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hitler’s Popularity "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hitler had promised the masses economic recovery—“work  and bread—and he delivered. Breaking with Brüning’s  do-nothing policies, Hitler launched a large public works  program to help pull Germany out of the depression. Work  began on superhighways, offices, gigantic sports stadiums,  and public housing. Hitler also appointed as Germany’s  central banker a well-known conservative named Hjalmar  Schacht, who skillfully restored credit and business. In  1936 an openly aggressive Hitler broke with Schacht, and  Germany turned decisively toward rearmament and preparation  for war. As a result of these policies (and plain good  luck), unemployment dropped steadily, from 6 million in  January 1933 to about 1 million in late 1936. By 1938  there was a shortage of workers, as unemployment fell to 2  percent, and women began to take jobs previously denied  them by the antifeminist Nazis. Thus between 1932 and  1938, the standard of living for the average employed  worker increased moderately. The profits of business rose  sharply. For millions of people, economic recovery was tangible  evidence that Nazi promises were more than show  and propaganda. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For the masses of ordinary German citizens who were  not Jews, Slavs, Gypsies, Jehovah’s Witnesses, communists,  or homosexuals, Hitler’s government meant greater  equality and more opportunities. In 1933 the position  of the traditional German elites—the landed aristocracy,  the wealthy capitalists, and the well-educated professional  classes—was still very strong. Barriers between classes were  generally high. Hitler’s rule introduced changes that lowered  these barriers. For example, stiff educational requirements,  which favored the well-to-do, were relaxed. The  new Nazi elite included many young and poorly educated  dropouts, rootless lower-middle-class people like Hitler  who rose to the top with breathtaking speed. More "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Yet few historians today believe that Hitler and the  Nazis brought about a real social revolution, as an earlier  generation of scholars often argued. Millions of modest  middle-class and lower-middle-class people felt that Germany  was becoming more open and equal, as Nazi propagandists  constantly claimed. But quantitative studies show  that the well-educated classes held on to most of their advantages  and that only a modest social leveling occurred  in the Nazi years. It is significant that the Nazis shared  with the Italian fascists the stereotypic view of women as  housewives and mothers. Only under the relentless pressure  of war did they reluctantly mobilize large numbers of  German women for work in offices and factories. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hitler’s rabid nationalism, which had helped him gain  power, continued to appeal to Germans after 1933. Ever  since the wars against Napoleon, many Germans had believed  in a special mission for a superior German nation.  The successes of Bismarck had furthered such feelings,  and near-victory in World War I made nationalists eager  for renewed expansion in the 1920s. Thus when Hitler  went from one foreign triumph to another and a great  German Empire seemed within reach, as we shall see, the  majority of the population was delighted and kept praising  the Führer’s actions well into World War II. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Not all Germans supported Hitler, however, and a number  of German groups actively resisted him after 1933.  Tens of thousands of political enemies were imprisoned,  and thousands were executed. But opponents of the Nazis  pursued various goals, and they were never unified, a fact  that helps account for their ultimate lack of success. In  the first years of Hitler’s rule, the principal resisters were the  communists and the socialists in the trade unions. But  the expansion of the SS system of terror after 1935 smashed  most of these leftists. A second group of opponents arose  in the Catholic and Protestant churches. However, their efforts  were directed primarily at preserving genuine religious  life, not at overthrowing Hitler. Finally in 1938 (and  again in 1942–1944), some high-ranking army officers,  who feared the consequences of Hitler’s reckless aggression,  plotted against him, unsuccessfully. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Hitler realized that his aggressive policies had to be  carefully camouflaged at first, for Germany’s army was  limited by the Treaty of Versailles to only one hundred  thousand men. As he told a group of army commanders  in February 1933, the early stages of his policy of “conquest  of new living space in the East and its ruthless Germanization  had serious dangers. If France had real  leaders, Hitler said, it would “not give us time but attack  us, presumably with its eastern satellites.12 Thus, although  Hitler loudly proclaimed his peaceful intentions,  Germany’s withdrawal from the League of Nations in  October 1933 indicated that Gustav Stresemann’s policy  of peaceful cooperation (see pages 930–932) was dead. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Following this action, Hitler sought to incorporate  independent Austria into a greater Germany. But a worried  Mussolini threatened to fight, and Hitler backed  down. When in March 1935 Hitler established a general  military draft and declared the “unequal disarmament  clauses of the Treaty of Versailles null and void, other countries  appeared to understand the danger. With France  taking the lead, Italy and Great Britain protested strongly  and warned against future aggressive actions. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Yet the emerging united front against Hitler quickly  collapsed. Of crucial importance, Britain adopted a policy  of appeasement, granting Hitler everything he could  reasonably want (and more) in order to avoid war. The  first step was an Anglo-German naval agreement in June  1935 that broke Germany’s isolation. The second step  came in March 1936 when Hitler suddenly marched his  armies into the demilitarized Rhineland, brazenly violating  the Treaties of Versailles and Locarno. This was the  last good chance to stop the Nazis, but an uncertain  France would not move without British support, and  Britain refused to act (Map 29.1). "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" British appeasement, which practically dictated French  policy, lasted far into 1939. It was motivated by British feelings  of guilt toward Germany and the pacifism of a population  still horrified by the memory of the First World War.

In the Battle of Britain, up to a thousand German planes  attacked British airfields and key factories in a single day,  dueling with British defenders high in the skies. Losses  were heavy on both sides. Then in September Hitler angrily  turned from military objectives to indiscriminate  bombing of British cities in an attempt to break British  morale. British aircraft factories increased production,  and the heavily bombed people of London defiantly dug  in. In September and October 1940, Britain was beating  Germany three to one in the air war. There was no possibility  of an immediate German invasion of Britain. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Turning from Britain and moving into the Balkans by  April 1941, Hitler now allowed his lifetime obsession  with a vast eastern European empire for the “master  race to dictate policy. In June 1941, German armies  suddenly attacked the Soviet Union along a vast front  (see Map 29.2).

In doing so, they showed what Nazi victory would have  meant. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hitler’s New Order was based firmly on the guiding  principle of Nazi totalitarianism: racial imperialism.  Within this New Order, the Nordic peoples—the Dutch,  Norwegians, and Danes—received preferential treatment,  for they were racially related to the master race, the Germans.

Many Poles, captured communists,  Gypsies, and Jehovah’s Witnesses were  murdered in cold blood. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" In 1941, as part of the “war of annihilation in the Soviet  Union, expulsion spiraled into extermination. On  the Russian front, Himmler’s special SS killing squads  and also regular army units forced Soviet Jews to dig giant  pits, which became mass graves as the victims were  lined up on the edge and cut down by machine guns.  Then in late 1941, Hitler and the Nazi leadership, in  some still-debated combination, ordered the SS to stop  all Jewish emigration from Europe and speeded up planning  for mass murder. As one German diplomat put it,  “The Jewish Question must be resolved in the course of  the war, for only so can it be solved without a worldwide  outcry.14 The “final solution of the Jewish question—  the murder of every single Jew—had begun. Jews were  systematically arrested, packed like cattle onto freight  trains, and dispatched to extermination camps. Many  Jews could hardly imagine the enormity of the crime that  lay before them. "}

As in Germany, only a few exceptional bystanders  did not turn a blind eye. Thus some scholars  have concluded that the key for most Germans (and most  people in occupied countries) was that they felt no personal  responsibility for Jews and therefore were not prepared  to help them. This meant that many individuals,  conditioned by Nazi racist propaganda but also influenced  by peer pressure and brutalizing wartime violence,  were psychologically prepared to join the SS ideologues  and perpetrate ever-greater crimes. They were ready to  plumb the depths of evil and to spiral downward from  mistreatment to arrest to mass murder. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" By late 1938, 1.5 million Japanese troops were bogged  down in China, holding a great swath of territory but unable  to defeat the Nationalists and the Communists (see  Map 29.3). Nor had Japan succeeded in building a large,  self-sufficient Asian economic zone, for it still depended  on oil and scrap metal from the Netherlands East Indies  and the United States. Thus Japanese leaders followed  events in Europe closely, looking for alliances and actions  that might improve their position in Asia. At home they  gave free rein to the anti-Western ultranationalism that  had risen in the 1920s and 1930s. In speeches, schools,  and newspapers ultranationalists proclaimed Japan’s liberating  mission in Asia, glorified the warrior virtues of  honor and sacrifice, and demanded absolute devotion to  the semidivine emperor. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The outbreak of war in Europe in 1939 and Hitler’s  early victories opened up opportunities for the Japanese  in Southeast Asia, where European empires appeared  vulnerable. Expanding the war in China, the Japanese  also pressured the Dutch to surrender control of the  Netherlands East Indies and its rich oil fields, but Dutch  colonial officials, backed by the British and the Americans,  refused. The United States had repeatedly condemned  Japanese aggression in China, and it now feared  that embattled Britain would collapse if it lost the support  of its Asian colonies. "}

The United States responded  with strong action, cutting off the sale of U.S. oil to  Japan and thereby reducing Japan’s oil supplies by 90  percent. Japanese leaders believed increasingly that war  with the United States was inevitable, for Japan’s battle  fleet would run out of fuel in eighteen months, and its industry  would be crippled. After much debate and almost  in desperation, Japanese leaders decided to launch a surprise  attack on the United States. They hoped to cripple  their Pacific rival, gain time to build a defensible Asian  empire, and eventually win an ill-defined compromise  peace. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Japanese attack on the U.S. naval base at Pearl  Harbor in the Hawaiian Islands was a complete surprise  but a limited success. On December 7, 1941, the Japanese  sank or crippled every American battleship, but by  chance all the all-important American aircraft carriers  were at sea and escaped unharmed. More important,  Pearl Harbor humiliated Americans and brought them  together in a spirit of anger and revenge. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Hitler immediately declared war on the United States.  Simultaneously, Japanese armies successfully attacked European  and American colonies in Southeast Asia.

{"prompt":"","completion":" The Japanese claimed that they were freeing Asians  from Western imperialism, and they called their empire  the Greater East Asian Co-prosperity Sphere. Some—  perhaps many—Japanese army officers and officials sincerely  believed that they were creating a mutually advantageous  union for the long-term development of  Asia. Initially they tapped currents of nationalist sentiment,  and most local populations were glad to see the  Western Powers go.

{"prompt":"","completion":" First of all, although the Japanese set up anticolonial  governments and promised genuine independence, real  power always rested with Japanese military commanders  and their superiors in Tokyo. The “independent governments  were basically shams. Second, the Japanese  never really delivered on their promises because they  were constantly improvising a frantic defense of their far- flung conquests from relentless attack by a determined  foe with vastly superior resources.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Most Jews deported to Auschwitz were murdered as  soon as they arrived, but the Nazis made some prisoners  into slave laborers and a few of these survived.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Like much of Italy’s small Jewish community, Levi’s  family belonged to the urban professional classes. The  young Primo graduated in 1941 from the University of  Turin with highest honors in chemistry. But since 1938,  when Italy introduced racial laws, he had faced growing  discrimination, and two years after graduation he  joined the antifascist resistance movement. Quickly  captured, he was deported to Auschwitz with 650 Italian  Jews in February 1944. Stone-faced SS men picked  only ninety-six men and twenty-nine women to work in  their respective labor camps. Primo was one of them. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Nothing prepared Levi for what he encountered.  The Jewish prisoners were kicked, punched, stripped,  branded with tattoos, crammed into huts, and worked  unmercifully. Hoping for some sign of prisoner solidarity  in this terrible environment, Levi found only a desperate  struggle of each against all and enormous status  differences among prisoners. Many stunned and bewildered  newcomers, beaten and demoralized by their  bosses—the most privileged prisoners—simply collapsed  and died. Others struggled to secure their own  privileges, however small, because food rations and  working conditions were so abominable that ordinary  Jewish prisoners perished in two to three months. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Sensitive and noncombative, Levi found himself sinking  into oblivion. But instead of joining the mass of the  “drowned, he became one of the “saved—a complicated  surprise with moral implications that he would  ponder all his life. As Levi explained in Survival in  Auschwitz (1947), the usual road to salvation in the  camps was some kind of collaboration with German  power.* Savage German criminals were released from  prison to become brutal camp guards; non-Jewish political  prisoners competed for jobs entitling them to better  conditions, and, especially troubling for Levi, a small  number of Jewish men plotted and struggled for the  power of life and death over other Jewish prisoners.  Though not one of these Jewish bosses, Levi believed  that he himself, like almost all survivors, had entered the  “gray zone of moral compromise. Only a very few superior  individuals, “the stuff of saints and martyrs, survived  the death camps without shifting their moral stance. "}

Levi also gained  critical support from three saintly prisoners, who refused to  do wicked and hateful acts. And he counted “luck as essential  for his survival: in the camp infirmary with scarlet  fever in February 1945 as advancing Russian armies prepared  to liberate the camp, Levi was not evacuated by the  Nazis and shot to death like most Jewish prisoners.

{"prompt":"","completion":" To further encourage mutual trust, the Allies adopted  the principle of the “unconditional surrender of Germany  and Japan.

{"prompt":"","completion":" The military resources of the Grand Alliance were awesome.  The strengths of the United States were its mighty  industry, its large population, and its national unity.

In  1943 it outproduced not only Germany, Italy, and Japan  but also all of the rest of the world combined. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Britain continued to make a great contribution as well.  The British economy was totally and effectively mobilized,  and the sharing of burdens through rationing and  heavy taxes on war profits maintained social harmony. By  early 1943 the Americans and the British were combining  small aircraft carriers with radar-guided bombers to rid  the Atlantic of German submarines. Britain, the impregnable  floating fortress, became a gigantic frontline staging  area for the decisive blow to the heart of Germany. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As for the Soviet Union, so great was its strength that  it might well have defeated Germany without Western  help. In the face of the German advance, whole factories  and populations were successfully evacuated to eastern  Russia and Siberia. There war production was reorganized  and expanded, and the Red Army was increasingly  well supplied and well led. Above all, Stalin drew on the  massive support and heroic determination of the Soviet  people, especially those in the central Russian heartland.

There, the Big Three jovially reaffirmed their determination  to crush Germany and searched for the appropriate  military strategy. Churchill, fearful of the military dangers  of a direct attack, argued that American and British  forces should follow up their Italian campaign with  an indirect attack on Germany through the Balkans.

When the Russian-backed communist army of North  Korea invaded South Korea in 1950, President Truman  acted swiftly. American-led United Nations forces  under General Douglas MacArthur intervened. Initially,  the North Koreans almost conquered the entire peninsula,  but the South Koreans and the Americans rallied  and advanced until China suddenly entered the war.  The bitter, bloody contest then seesawed back and forth  near where it had begun, as President Truman rejected  General MacArthur’s call to attack China and fired him  instead. In 1953 a fragile truce was negotiated, and the  fighting stopped. Thus the United States extended its  policy of containment to Asia but drew back from an  attack on communist China and possible nuclear war. "}

After Hitler’s invasion of the Soviet Union, the  Western Powers preferred to ignore this question and  hope for the best. But when Stalin later began to claim  the spoils of victory, the United States began to protest  and professed outrage. This belated opposition quite  possibly encouraged even more aggressive measures by  the always-suspicious Stalin, and it helped explode the  quarrel over eastern Europe into a global confrontation.

Their very able leader was  Alcide De Gasperi, a courageous antifascist firmly committed  to political democracy, economic reconstruction,  and moderate social reform. In France, too, the Catholic  Party also provided some of the best postwar leaders after  January 1946, when General Charles de Gaulle, the  inspiring wartime leader of the Free French, resigned after  having re-established the free and democratic Fourth  Republic. As Germany was partitioned by the cold war, a  purified Federal Republic of Germany (as West Germany  was officially known) found new and able leadership  among its Catholics. In 1949 Konrad Adenauer, the former  mayor of Cologne and a long-time anti-Nazi, began  his long, highly successful democratic rule; the Christian  Democrats became West Germany’s majority party for  a generation. In providing effective leadership for their  respective countries, the Christian Democrats were inspired  and united by a common Christian and European  heritage.

Britain followed  the same trend, as the newly elected socialist Labour  Party established a “welfare state.

Never  before had the European economy grown so fast. There  were many reasons for western Europe’s brilliant economic  performance. American aid helped the process get  off to a fast start. Moreover, economic growth became a  basic objective of all western European governments, for  leaders and voters were determined to avoid a return to  the dangerous and demoralizing stagnation of the 1930s.

But in 1927  Chiang Kai-shek (1887–1975), successor to Sun Yat-sen  (see page 872) and leader of the Guomindang, broke with  his more radical communist allies, headed by Mao Zedong  (Mao Tse-tung), and tried to destroy them.

Even war  could not force Mao and Chiang to cooperate. By late  1945 their long-standing quarrel had erupted in civil  war. Stalin gave Mao some aid, and the Americans gave  Chiang much more.

In British-mandated  Palestine, where after 1918 the British government established  a Jewish homeland alongside the Arab population,  violence and terrorism mounted on both sides. In  1947 the frustrated British decided to leave Palestine,  and the United Nations then voted in a nonbinding resolution  to divide Palestine into two states—one Arab and  one Jewish, which became Israel. The Jews accepted the  plan but the Arabs did not, and in 1948 they attacked the  Jewish state as soon as it was proclaimed. The Israelis  drove off the invaders and conquered more territory, as  roughly 900,000 Arabs fled or were expelled. Holocaust  survivors from Europe streamed into Israel, as Theodor  Herzl’s Zionist dream came true (see page 839).

In 1956 Nasser abruptly nationalized  the foreign-owned Suez Canal Company, the  last symbol and substance of Western power in the Middle  East. Infuriated, the British and the French, along  with the Israelis, invaded Egypt. This was, however, the  dying gasp of traditional imperial power: the Americans  joined with the Soviets to force the British, French, and  Israelis to withdraw. Nasser and anti-Western Egyptian  nationalism triumphed. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The failure of Britain and France to unseat Nasser in  1956 encouraged Arab nationalists in Algeria. The country’s  large French population considered colonial Algeria  an integral part of France and was determined to stay in  Algeria and continue dominating the Arab majority.  This settler determination made the Algerian war for  independence long, bloody, and dirty, with systematic  torture and numerous atrocities on both sides. In the  end, General de Gaulle, who had returned to power as  part of the movement to keep Algeria French, accepted  the principle of Algerian self-determination.

According to this view, neocolonialism  was a system designed to perpetuate Western  economic domination and undermine the promise of  political independence, thereby extending to Africa  (and much of Asia) the economic subordination that  the United States had established in Latin America in  the nineteenth century.

As early as 1944,  the leading members of the Communist Party were being  given a new motivating slogan: “The war on Fascism  ends, the war on capitalism begins.4 By early 1946,  Stalin was publicly singing the old tune that war was inevitable  as long as capitalism existed. Stalin’s new foreign  foe in the West provided an excuse for re-establishing a  harsh dictatorship.

The  Communist Parties of eastern Europe had established  one-party states by 1948, thanks to the help of the Red  Army and the Russian secret police. Rigid ideological indoctrination,  attacks on religion, and a lack of civil liberties  were soon facts of life. Industry was nationalized, and  the middle class was stripped of its possessions. Economic  life was then faithfully recast in the Stalinist mold. Forced  industrialization lurched forward without regard for human  costs. The collectivization of agriculture began. "}

Popular Communist leaders who, like Tito, had led the resistance  against Germany were purged as Stalin sought to  create absolutely obedient instruments of domination in  eastern Europe. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Reform and De-Stalinization,  1953–1964 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In 1953 the aging Stalin finally died, and the dictatorship  that he had built began to change. Even as Stalin’s heirs  struggled for power, they realized that reforms were necessary  because of the widespread fear and hatred of  Stalin’s political terrorism. The power of the secret police  was curbed, and many of the forced-labor camps were  gradually closed. Change was also necessary for economic  reasons. Moreover, Stalin’s belligerent foreign policy had  led directly to a strong Western alliance, which isolated  the Soviet Union. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" On the question of just how much change should be  permitted in order to preserve the system, the Communist  leadership was badly split. Conservatives wanted to  make as few changes as possible. Reformers, who were led  by Nikita Khrushchev, argued for major innovations.  Khrushchev (1894–1971), who had joined the party as an  uneducated coal miner in 1918 and risen to a high-level  position in the 1930s, emerged as the new ruler in 1955. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" The liberalization—or de-Stalinization, as it was called  in the West—of the Soviet Union was genuine. The  Communist Party jealously maintained its monopoly on  political power, but Khrushchev shook up the party and  brought in new members. Some resources were shifted  from heavy industry and the military toward consumer  goods and agriculture, and Stalinist controls over workers  were relaxed. The Soviet Union’s very low standard  of living finally began to improve and continued to rise  substantially throughout the booming 1960s. "}

It tells the story of a  prerevolutionary intellectual who rejects the violence and  brutality of the revolution of 1917 and the Stalinist years.

But after the new government  promised free elections and renounced Hungary’s  military alliance with Moscow, the Russian leaders  ordered an invasion and crushed the national and democratic  revolution. Fighting was bitter until the end, for  the Hungarians hoped that the United States would  come to their aid. When this did not occur, most people  in eastern Europe concluded that their only hope was to  strive for small domestic gains while following Russia  obediently in foreign affairs. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The End of Reform "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" By late 1962, opposition in party circles to Khrushchev’s  policies was strong, and in 1964 Khrushchev fell in a  bloodless palace revolution. Under Leonid Brezhnev  (1906–1982), the Soviet Union began a period of stagnation  and limited “re-Stalinization. The basic reason  for this development was that Khrushchev’s Communist  colleagues saw de-Stalinization as a dangerous threat to  the dictatorial authority of the party. The party had to  tighten up considerably while there was still time.  Khrushchev had to go. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Another reason for conservative opposition was that  Khrushchev’s policy toward the West was erratic and ultimately  unsuccessful. In 1958 he ordered the Western allies  to evacuate West Berlin within six months. In response,  the allies reaffirmed their unity in West Berlin, and  Khrushchev backed down. Then in 1961, as relations with  communist China deteriorated dramatically, Khrushchev  ordered the East Germans to build a wall between East  and West Berlin, thereby sealing off West Berlin in clear  violation of existing access agreements between the Great  Powers. The recently elected U.S. president, John F.  Kennedy, acquiesced to the construction of the Berlin  Wall. Emboldened and seeing a chance to change the balance  of military power decisively, Khrushchev ordered missiles  with nuclear warheads installed in Fidel Castro’s  communist Cuba in 1962. President Kennedy countered  with a naval blockade of Cuba. After a tense diplomatic cri"}

{"prompt":"","completion":" In 1964, Brezhnev and his supporters took over. Almost  immediately they started talking quietly of Stalin’s  “good points and ignoring his crimes. This change informed  Soviet citizens that further liberalization could  not be expected at home. Soviet leaders, determined  never to suffer Khrushchev’s humiliation in the face of  American nuclear superiority, also launched a massive  arms buildup. Yet Brezhnev and company proceeded cautiously  in the mid-1960s and avoided direct confrontation  with the United States. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In the wake of Khrushchev’s reforms, the 1960s brought  modest liberalization and more consumer goods to eastern  Europe, as well as somewhat greater national autonomy,  especially in Poland and Romania. In January 1968,  the reform elements in the Czechoslovak Communist  Party gained a majority and voted out the long-time Stalinist  leader in favor of Alexander Dubc?ek (1921–1992),  whose new government launched dramatic reforms. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Educated in Moscow, Dubc?ek was a dedicated Communist.  But he and his allies believed that they could  reconcile genuine socialism with personal freedom and  internal party democracy. Thus local decision making by  trade unions, managers, and consumers replaced rigid  bureaucratic planning, and censorship was relaxed. The  reform program proved enormously popular. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Although Dubc?ek remembered the lesson of the Hungarian  revolution and constantly proclaimed his loyalty to  the Warsaw Pact, the determination of the Czechoslovak  reformers to build what they called “socialism with a human  face frightened hard-line Communists. These fears  were particularly strong in Poland and East Germany,  where leaders knew full well that they lacked popular support.  Moreover, the Soviet Union feared that a liberalized  Czechoslovakia would eventually be drawn to neutrality  or even to the democratic West. Thus the Eastern bloc  countries launched a concerted campaign of intimidation  against the Czechoslovak leaders, and in August 1968,  500,000 Russian and allied eastern European troops suddenly  occupied Czechoslovakia. The Czechoslovaks made  no attempt to resist militarily, and the arrested leaders surrendered  to Soviet demands. The reform program was  abandoned, and the Czechoslovak experiment in humanizing  communism came to an end. Shortly after the invasion  of Czechoslovakia, Brezhnev declared the so-called  Brezhnev Doctrine, according to which the Soviet Union  and its allies had the right to intervene in any socialist  country whenever they saw the need.

{"prompt":"","completion":" A slowly rising standard of living for ordinary people  contributed to the apparent stability in the Soviet Union,  although long lines and innumerable shortages persisted.  Ambitious individuals had a tremendous incentive to do  as the state wished in order to gain access to special, well- stocked stores, to attend special schools, and to travel  abroad. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Another source of stability was the enduring nationalism  of ordinary Great Russians. Party leaders successfully  identified themselves with Russian patriotism,  stressing their role in saving the country during the Second  World War and protecting it now from foreign  foes, including eastern European “counter-revolutionaries.  Moreover, the politically dominant Great Russians,  who were concentrated in the central Russian heartland,  generally feared that greater freedom might result  in demands for autonomy and even independence "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" \f not only by eastern European nationalities but also by  the non-Russian nationalities within the Soviet Union  itself. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The strength of the government was expressed in the  re-Stalinization of culture and art. Critical free expression  disappeared. Acts of open nonconformity and public  protest were severely punished, but by sophisticated, cunning  methods. Most frequently, dissidents were blacklisted  and thus rendered unable to find decent jobs since  the government was the only employer. This fate was  enough to keep most in line. More determined protesters  were quietly imprisoned, while celebrated nonconformists  such as Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn were permanently expelled  from the country. Eliminating the worst aspects  of Stalin’s dictatorship strengthened the regime, and almost  all Western experts concluded that rule by a self- perpetuating Communist Party elite in the Soviet  Union appeared to be quite solid in the 1970s and early  1980s.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Yet beneath the dreary immobility of political life in  the Brezhnev era, the Soviet Union was actually experiencing  profound changes. Three of these changes, which  were seldom appreciated by Western observers at the  time, were particularly significant. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" First, the growth of the urban population, which had  raced forward at breakneck speed in the Stalin years, continued  rapidly in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1985 two- thirds of all Soviet citizens lived in cities, and one-quarter  lived in big cities. Of great significance, this expanding  urban population lost its old peasant ways, exchanging  them for more education, better job skills, and greater  sophistication. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Second, the number of highly trained scientists, managers,  and specialists expanded prodigiously, increasing  fourfold between 1960 and 1985. Thus the class of well- educated, pragmatic, and self-confident experts, which  played such an important role in restructuring industrial  societies after World War II (see the discussion in the  next section), continued to develop rapidly in the Soviet  Union after 1968. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Third, education and freedom for experts in their special  areas helped foster the gradual growth of Soviet public  opinion. Educated people read, discussed, and formed  definite ideas on important issues, many of which could  be approached and debated in “nonpolitical terms. Developing  ideas on such questions as environmental pollution  and urban transportation, educated urban people  increasingly saw themselves as worthy of having a voice  in society’s decisions, even its political decisions.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Populous, victorious, and wealthy, the United States  took the lead in Big Science after World War II. Between  1945 and 1965, spending on scientific research and development  in the United States grew five times as fast as the  national income, and by 1965 such spending took 3 percent  of all U.S. income. It was generally accepted that  government should finance science heavily in both the  “capitalist United States and the “socialist Soviet Union. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" One reason for the parallel between the two countries  was that science was not demobilized in either country  after the war. Scientists remained a critical part of every  major military establishment, and a large portion of all  postwar scientific research went for “defense. New weapons  such as rockets, nuclear submarines, and spy satellites  demanded breakthroughs no less remarkable than  those of radar and the first atomic bomb. After 1945  roughly one-quarter of all men and women trained in science  and engineering in the West—and perhaps more in  the Soviet Union—were employed full-time in the production  of weapons to kill other humans. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Sophisticated science, lavish government spending, and  military needs all came together in the space race of the  1960s. In 1957 the Soviets used long-range rockets developed  in their nuclear weapons program to put a satellite in  orbit. In 1961 they sent the world’s first cosmonaut circling  the globe. Embarrassed by Soviet triumphs, the United  States made an all-out U.S. commitment to catch up with  the Soviets and landed a crewed spacecraft on the moon in  1969. Four more moon landings followed by 1972. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The rapid expansion of government-financed research  in the United States attracted many of Europe’s best scientists  during the 1950s and 1960s. Thoughtful Europeans  lamented this “brain drain and feared that Europe  was falling hopelessly behind the United States in science  and technology. In fact, a revitalized Europe was already  responding to the American challenge, with countries  pooling their efforts on such Big Science projects as the  Concorde supersonic passenger airliner and the peaceful  uses of atomic energy. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The rise of Big Science and of close ties between science  and technology greatly altered the lives of scientists. The  scientific community grew much larger than ever before.  There were about four times as many scientists in Europe  and North America in 1975 as in 1945. Scientists, technologists,  engineers, and medical specialists were counted  after 1945, in part because there were so many of them. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" One consequence of the growth of science was its high  degree of specialization, for no one could possibly master  a broad field such as physics or medicine. Intense specialization  in new disciplines and subdisciplines increased the  rates at which both basic knowledge was acquired and  practical applications were made. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Highly specialized modern scientists and technologists  normally had to work as members of a team, which completely  changed the work and lifestyle of modern scientists.  A great deal of work therefore went on in large  bureaucratic organizations, where the individual was very  often a small cog in a great machine. The growth of large  scientific bureaucracies in government and private enterprise  suggested how scientists and technologists permeated  the entire society and many aspects of life. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Modern science became highly, even brutally, competitive.  This competitiveness is well depicted in Nobel Prize  winner James Watson’s fascinating book The Double Helix,  which tells how in 1953 Watson and an Englishman,  Francis Crick, discovered the structure of DNA, the molecule  of heredity. A brash young American Ph.D. in his  twenties, Watson seemed almost obsessed by the idea  that some other research team would find the solution  first and thereby deprive him of the fame and fortune he  desperately wanted. With so many thousands of like- minded researchers in the wealthy countries of the world,  scientific and technical knowledge rushed forward in the  postwar era. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Changes in the structure of the middle class were particularly  influential in the general drift toward a less rigid  class structure. In the nineteenth and early twentieth  centuries, the model for the middle class had been the  independent, self-employed individual who owned a  business or practiced a liberal profession such as law or  medicine. Ownership of property—very often inherited  property—and strong family ties had often been the keys  to wealth and standing within the middle class. After  1945 this pattern declined drastically in western Europe.  A new breed of managers and experts replaced traditional  property owners as the leaders of the middle class. Ability  to serve the needs of a big organization largely replaced  inherited property and family connections in determining  an individual’s social position in the middle and upper  middle classes. At the same time, the middle class grew  massively and became harder to define. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Top managers and ranking civil servants therefore  represented the model for a new middle class of salaried  specialists. Well paid and highly trained, often with backgrounds  in engineering or accounting, these experts increasingly  came from all social classes, even the working  class. Pragmatic and realistic, they were primarily concerned  with efficiency and practical solutions to concrete  problems. This new middle class was more open, democratic,  and insecure than the old propertied middle class. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The structure of the lower classes also became more  flexible and open. There was a mass exodus from farms  and the countryside, as one of the most traditional and  least mobile groups in European society drastically declined.  Meanwhile, the industrial working class ceased to  expand and began to decline, while job opportunities for  white-collar and service employees grew rapidly. Such employees  bore a greater resemblance to the new middle  class of salaried specialists than to industrial workers, who  were also better educated and more specialized. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" European governments were reducing class tensions  with a series of social security reforms.

Most European  governments also gave maternity grants and built  inexpensive public housing for low-income families and  individuals. These and other social reforms provided a  humane floor of well-being. Reforms also promoted  greater equality because they were expensive and were  paid for in part by higher taxes on the rich. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There were several reasons for these developments.  Rapid industrial and technological expansion created in  large corporations and government agencies a powerful  demand for technologists and managers. Moreover, the  old propertied middle class lost control of many family- owned businesses, and many small businesses (including  family farms) simply passed out of existence as their former  owners joined the ranks of salaried employees.

{"prompt":"","completion":" The rising standard of living and the spread of standardized  consumer goods also worked to level Western society,  as the percentage of income spent on food and drink  declined substantially. For example, the European automobile  industry expanded phenomenally after lagging far  behind the United States since the 1920s. In 1948 there  were only 5 million cars in western Europe, but in 1965  there were 44 million. Car ownership was democratized  and came within the range of better-paid workers. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Europeans took great pleasure in the products of the  “gadget revolution as well. Like Americans, Europeans  filled their houses and apartments with washing machines,  vacuum cleaners, refrigerators, dishwashers, radios, TVs,  and stereos. The purchase of consumer goods was greatly  facilitated by installment purchasing, which allowed people  to buy on credit. With the expansion of social security  safeguards, reducing the need to accumulate savings for  hard times and old age, ordinary people were increasingly  willing to take on debt. This change had far-reaching  consequences. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Leisure and recreation occupied an important place in  consumer societies. The most astonishing leisure-time  development was the blossoming of mass travel and  tourism. With month-long paid vacations required by  law in most European countries and widespread automobile  ownership, beaches and ski resorts came within the  reach of the middle class and much of the working class.  By the late 1960s, packaged tours with cheap group  flights and bargain hotel accommodations had made  even distant lands easily accessible. A French company  grew rich building imitation Tahitian paradises around  the world. At Swedish nudist colonies on secluded West  African beaches, officeworkers from Stockholm fleetingly  worshiped the sun in the middle of the long northern  winter. Truly, consumerism had come of age. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" New Roles for Women "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A growing emancipation of women in Europe and North  America was unquestionably one of the most significant  transformations of the cold war era. This historic development  grew out of long-term changes in the basic patterns  of motherhood and paid work outside the home. These  changing patterns altered women’s experiences and expectations,  preparing the way for the success of a new generation  of feminist thinkers and a militant women’s movement  in the 1970s and 1980s (see pages 1009–1010). "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Before the Industrial Revolution, most Europeans married  late. Once a woman was married, however, she usually  had children as long as she was fertile. By the late nineteenth  century, improved diet, higher incomes, and the  use of contraception within marriage were producing the "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" demographic transition from high birthrates and death  rates to low birthrates and death rates. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" These trends continued in the twentieth century. In the  1950s and 1960s, the typical woman in the West married  early and bore her children quickly. The postwar baby  boom did make for larger families and a fairly rapid population  growth of 1 to 1.5 percent per year in many European  countries. However, in the 1960s the long-term  decline in birthrates resumed, and from the mid-1970s on  in many European countries, the total population practically  stopped growing from natural increase, with limited  subsequent growth coming mainly from immigation. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The postwar culmination of the trends toward early  marriage, early childbearing, and small family size in  wealthy urban societies had revolutionary implications  for women. Above all, pregnancy and child care occupied  a much smaller portion of a woman’s life than in earlier  times. By the early 1970s, about half of Western women  were having their last baby by the age of twenty-six or  twenty-seven. When the youngest child trooped off to  kindergarten, the average mother had more than forty  years of life in front of her. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This was a momentous change. Throughout history  male-dominated society insisted on defining most women  as mothers or potential mothers, and motherhood was  very demanding.

{"prompt":"","completion":" The trend went the furthest in communist eastern Europe,  where women accounted for almost half of all employed  persons. In noncommunist western Europe and  North America, there was a good deal of variation, with  the percentage of married women in the workforce rising  from a range of roughly 20 to 25 percent in 1950 to a  range of 40 to 70 percent in the early 1980s. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Rising employment for married women went hand in  hand with the decline of the birthrate (see Figure 30.1).  Women who worked outside the home had significantly  fewer children than women of the same age who did not.  Raising a family while holding down a full-time job was a  tremendous challenge and often resulted in a woman’s  being grossly overworked. The multiple demands of job,  motherhood, and marriage became more manageable  with fewer children. "}

As the divorce rate rose in the 1960s, part-time work,  with its low pay and scanty benefits, meant poverty for  many women with teenage children. Finally, in the best of  circumstances, married working women still carried most  of the child-raising and housekeeping responsibilities. A  reason for many to accept part-time employment, this gendered  imbalance meant an exhausting “double day—on  the job and at home—for the full-time worker. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The injustices that married women encountered as wage  earners contributed greatly to the subsequent movement  for women’s equality and emancipation. A young unmarried  woman of a hundred years ago was more likely to accept  such problems as temporary nuisances because she  looked forward to marriage and motherhood for fulfillment.  In the postwar era, a married wage earner in her thirties  gradually developed a very different perspective. She  saw employment as a permanent condition within which  she, like her male counterpart, sought not only income but  also psychological satisfaction. Sexism and discrimination in "}

First, mass communications  and youth travel linked countries and continents  together. Second, the postwar baby boom meant  that young people became an unusually large part of the  population and could therefore exercise exceptional influence  on society as a whole. Third, postwar prosperity  and greater equality gave young people more purchasing  power than ever before.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Student protests in western Europe also highlighted  more general problems of youth, education, and a society  of specialists. In contrast to the United States, high  school and university educations in Europe had been limited  for centuries to a small elite. Whereas 22 percent of  the American population was going on to some form of  higher education in 1950, only 3 to 4 percent of western  European youths were doing so. Then enrollments skyrocketed.  By 1960 at least three times as many students  were going to some kind of university as had attended  before the war, and the number continued to rise sharply  until the 1970s. Reflecting the development of a more  democratic class structure and a growing awareness that  higher education was the key to success, European universities  gave more scholarships and opened their doors to  more students from the lower middle and lower classes.

{"prompt":"","completion":" The many tensions within the exploding university  population came to a head in the late 1960s and early  1970s. As in the United States, European university students  rose to challenge their university administrations  and even their governments. The most far-reaching of  these revolts occurred in France in 1968. Students occupied  buildings and took over the University of Paris,  which led to violent clashes with police.

Thoroughly frightened by the student-sparked  upheaval and fearing an eventual communist takeover, the  masses of France voted overwhelmingly for de Gaulle’s  party and a return to law and order. Workers went back to  work, and the mini-revolution collapsed. Yet the proud de  Gaulle and the postwar European renaissance that he represented  had been shaken, and within a year he resigned.

From the late  1940s on, most Americans and their leaders viewed the  world in terms of a constant struggle to stop the spread  of communism. As western Europe began to revive and  China established a communist government in 1949, efforts  to contain communism shifted to Asia. The bloody  Korean War (1950–1953) ended in stalemate, but the  United States did succeed in preventing a communist  victory in South Korea. After the defeat of the French in  Vietnam in 1954, the Eisenhower administration refused  to sign the Geneva Accords that temporarily divided the  country into two zones pending national unification by  means of free elections. President Eisenhower then acquiesced  in the refusal of the anticommunist South Vietnamese  government to accept the verdict of elections and  provided it with military aid. President Kennedy greatly  increased the number of American “military advisers to  sixteen thousand. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" After winning the 1964 election on a peace platform,  President Johnson greatly expanded the American role in  the Vietnam conflict. American strategy was to “escalate  the war sufficiently to break the will of the North Vietnamese  and their southern allies without resorting to  “overkill, which might risk war with the entire Communist  bloc. Thus South Vietnam received massive military  aid, American forces in the South gradually grew to half a  million men, and the United States bombed North Vietnam  with ever-greater intensity. But there was no invasion  of the North or naval blockade. In the end, the American  strategy of limited warfare backfired.

But Washington had been claiming that victory  in South Vietnam was in sight, and U.S. critics of the  Vietnam War quickly interpreted the bloody combat as  a decisive American defeat.

A second consequence of  the U.S. crisis was that after more than thirty-five years of  battle, the Vietnamese communists unified their country  in 1975 as a harsh dictatorial state.

{"prompt":"","completion":" One alternative to the badly damaged policy of containing  communism was the policy of détente, or the progressive  piecemeal relaxation of cold war tensions. Thus  while the cold war continued to rage outside Europe and  generally defined superpower relations between the Soviet  Union and the United States, West Germany took a  major step toward genuine peace in Europe. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" West German chancellor Willy Brandt (1913–1992)  took the lead when in December 1970 he flew to Poland  for the signing of a historic treaty of reconciliation. In  a dramatic moment rich in symbolism, Brandt laid a  wreath at the tomb of the Polish unknown soldier and  another at the monument commemorating the armed  uprising of Warsaw’s Jewish ghetto against occupying  Nazi armies. Standing before the ghetto memorial, a  somber Brandt fell to his knees and knelt as if in prayer.  “I wanted, Brandt said later, “to ask pardon in the name  of our people for a million-fold crime which was committed  in the misused name of the Germans.9 "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Brandt’s gesture at the Warsaw Ghetto memorial and  the treaty with Poland were part of his policy of reconciliation  with eastern Europe. Indeed, Brandt aimed at nothing  less than a comprehensive peace settlement for central  Europe and the two German states established after 1945.  The Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) had  long claimed that the communist German Democratic Republic  (East Germany) lacked free elections and hence any  legal or moral basis. West Germany also refused to accept  the loss of German territory taken by Poland and the Soviet  Union after 1945. But Brandt, the popular socialist  mayor of West Berlin when the Berlin Wall was built in  1961, believed that the wall showed the painful limitations  of West Germany’s official hard line toward communist  eastern Europe. A new foreign policy was needed. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Winning the chancellorship in 1969, Brandt negotiated  treaties with the Soviet Union, Poland, and Czechoslovakia  that formally accepted existing state boundaries  in return for a mutual renunciation of force or the threat  of force. Using the imaginative formula of “two German  states within one German nation, Brandt’s government  also broke decisively with the past and entered into direct  relations with East Germany. He aimed for modest practical  improvements rather than reunification, which at  that point was completely impractical. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The policy of détente reached its high point when all  European nations (except isolationist Albania), the United  States, and Canada signed the Final Act of the Helsinki  Conference in 1975. The thirty-five nations participating  agreed that Europe’s existing political frontiers could not  be changed by force. They also solemnly accepted nu"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" merous provisions guaranteeing the human rights and political  freedoms of their citizens. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Primary Source: The Helsinki Final Act: Human Rights  and Fundamental Freedoms Enunciated "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Optimistic hopes for détente in international relations  gradually faded in the later 1970s. Brezhnev’s Soviet Union  ignored the human rights provisions of the Helsinki agreement,  and East-West political competition remained very  much alive outside Europe. Many Americans became convinced  that the Soviet Union was taking advantage of détente,  steadily building up its military might and pushing  for political gains and revolutions in Africa, Asia, and Latin  America. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in December  1979, which was designed to save an increasingly unpopular  Marxist regime, was especially alarming. Many Americans  feared that the oil-rich states of the Persian Gulf would  be next, and once again they looked to the Atlantic alliance  and military might to thwart communist expansion. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" President Jimmy Carter (b. 1924), elected in 1976,  tried to lead the Atlantic alliance beyond verbal condemnation  and urged economic sanctions against the Soviet  Union. Yet only Great Britain among the European allies  supported the American initiative. The alliance showed  the same lack of concerted action when the Solidarity  movement rose in Poland. Some observers concluded  that the alliance had lost the will to think and act decisively  in dealing with the Soviet bloc. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Atlantic alliance endured, however. The U.S. military  buildup launched by Carter in his last years in office  was greatly accelerated by President Ronald Reagan  (1911–2004), who was swept into office in 1980 by a  wave of patriotism and economic discontent. The new  American leadership acted as if the military balance had  tipped in favor of the Soviet Union, which Reagan anathematized  as the “evil empire. Increasing defense spending  enormously, the Reagan administration concentrated  on nuclear arms and an expanded navy as keys to American  power in the post-Vietnam age. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A broad swing in the historical pendulum toward  greater conservatism in the 1980s gave Reagan invaluable  allies in western Europe. In Great Britain a strong- willed Margaret Thatcher worked well with Reagan and  was a forceful advocate for a revitalized Atlantic alliance.  After a strongly pro-American Helmut Kohl (b. 1930)  came to power with the conservative Christian Democrats  in 1982, West Germany and the United States once  again effectively coordinated military and political policy  toward the Soviet bloc. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Passing in the 1970s and early 1980s from détente  to confusion to regeneration, the Atlantic alliance bent, "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 1009  but it did not break. In maintaining the alliance, the Western  nations gave indirect support to ongoing efforts to  liberalize authoritarian communist eastern Europe and  probably helped convince the Soviet Union’s Mikhail  Gorbachev that endless cold war conflict was foolish and  dangerous. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Women’s Movement "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The 1970s marked the birth of a broad-based feminist  movement devoted to securing genuine gender equality  and promoting the general interests of women. Three  basic reasons accounted for this major development.  First, ongoing changes in underlying patterns of motherhood  and paid work created novel conditions and new  demands (see pages 1002–1004). Second, a vanguard of  feminist intellectuals articulated a powerful critique of  gender relations, which stimulated many women to rethink  their assumptions and challenge the status quo.  Third, taking a lesson from the civil rights movement in  the United States and worldwide student protest against  the Vietnam War, dissatisfied individuals recognized that  they had to band together if they were to influence politics  and secure fundamental reforms. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" One of the most influential works produced by this  new feminist wave was The Second Sex (1949) by the  French writer and philosopher Simone de Beauvoir  (1908–1986). Characterizing herself as a “dutiful daughter  of the bourgeoisie in childhood, the adolescent  Beauvoir came to see her pious and submissive mother as  foolishly renouncing any self-expression outside of home  and marriage and showing Beauvoir the dangers of a life  she did not want. A brilliant university student, Beauvoir  began at the Sorbonne a complex relationship with Jean- Paul Sartre, the future philosopher who became her lifelong  intellectual companion and sometime lover. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Beauvoir analyzed the position of women within the  framework of existential thought (see pages 916–917).  She argued that women—like all human beings—were in  essence free but that they had almost always been trapped  by particularly inflexible and limiting conditions. (See  the feature “Listening to the Past: A Feminist Critique of  Marriage on pages 1016–1017.) Only by means of courageous  action and self-assertive creativity could a woman  become a completely free person and escape the role of  the inferior “other that men had constructed for her  gender. Drawing on history, philosophy, psychology,  biology, and literature, Beauvoir’s massive investigation  inspired a generation of women intellectuals. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Primary Source: The Second Sex: Existential Feminism "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" One such woman was Betty Friedan (b. 1924), who  played a key role in reopening a serious discussion of  women’s issues in the United States. As a working wife  and the mother of three small children in the 1950s,  Friedan became acutely aware of the conflicting pressures  of career and family. Conducting an in-depth survey of  her classmates at Smith College fifteen years after their  graduation, she concluded that many well-educated  women shared her growing dissatisfaction. In her path- breaking study The Feminine Mystique (1963), Friedan  identified this dissatisfaction as the “problem that has no  name. According to Friedan, the cause of this nameless  problem was a crisis of identity. Women were not permitted  to become mature adults and genuine human beings.  Instead, they were expected to conform to a false,  infantile pattern of femininity and live (like Beauvoir’s  mother) for their husbands and children. In short,  women faced what feminists would soon call sexism, a  pervasive social problem that required drastic reforms. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When long-standing proposals to treat sex discrimination  as seriously as race discrimination fell again on deaf  ears, Friedan took the lead in 1966 in founding the  National Organization for Women (NOW) to press for  women’s rights. NOW flourished, growing from seven  hundred members in 1967 to forty thousand in 1974.  Many other women’s organizations of varying persuasions  rose to follow NOW in Europe and the United  States. Throughout the 1970s, a proliferation of publications,  conferences, and institutions devoted to women’s  issues reinforced the emerging international movement. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Although national peculiarities abounded, this movement  generally shared the common strategy of entering  the political arena and changing laws regarding women.  First, advocates of women’s rights pushed for new  statutes in the workplace: laws against discrimination,  “equal pay for equal work, and measures such as maternal  leave and affordable day care designed to help women  combine careers and family responsibilities. Second, the  movement concentrated on gender and family questions,  including the right to divorce (in some Catholic countries),  legalized abortion, the needs of single mothers,  and protection from rape and physical violence. In almost  every country, the effort to decriminalize abortion served  as a catalyst in mobilizing an effective, self-conscious  women’s movement (and in creating an opposition to it,  as in the United States). "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In countries that had long placed women in a subordinate  position, the legal changes were little less than revolutionary.  In Italy, for example, new laws abolished  restrictions on divorce and abortion, which had been  strengthened by Mussolini and defended energetically by  the Catholic Church in the postwar era. By 1988 divorce "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" and abortion were common in Italy, which had the lowest  birthrate in Europe. More generally, the sharply focused  women’s movement of the 1970s won new rights  for women. Subsequently, the movement became more  diffuse, a victim of both its successes and the resurgence  of an antifeminist opposition. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The accomplishments of the women’s movement encouraged  mobilization by many other groups. Gay men  and lesbian women pressed their own demands, organizing  politically and calling for an end to legal discrimination  and social harassment. People with physical disabilities  joined together to promote their interests. Thus many  subordinate groups challenged the dominant majorities, "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" and the expansion and redefinition of human liberty—  one of the great themes of modern Western and world  history—continued. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Troubled Economy "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For twenty years after 1945, most Europeans were preoccupied  with the possibilities of economic progress and  consumerism. The more democratic class structure also  helped to reduce social tension, and ideological conflict  went out of style. In the late 1960s, sharp criticism and  social conflict re-emerged, however, marking the passing  of postwar stability. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Yet it was the reappearance of economic crisis in the  early 1970s that brought the most serious challenges for  the average person. The postwar international monetary  system was based on the American dollar, valued in gold  at $35 an ounce. Giving foreign aid and fighting foreign  wars, the United States sent billions abroad. By early  1971, it had only $11 billion in gold left, and Europe  had accumulated U.S. $50 billion. Foreigners then panicked  and raced to exchange their dollars for gold. President  Richard Nixon responded by stopping the sale of  American gold. The value of the dollar fell sharply, and  inflation accelerated worldwide. Fixed rates of exchange  were abandoned, and great uncertainty replaced postwar  predictability in international trade and finance. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Even more damaging was the dramatic reversal in the  price and availability of energy. The great postwar boom  was fueled by cheap oil from the Middle East, which permitted  energy-intensive industries—automobiles, chemicals,  and electric power—to expand rapidly and lead other  sectors of the economy forward. By 1971 the Arab-led  Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)  had watched the price of crude oil decline consistently  compared with the rising price of manufactured goods  and had decided to reverse that trend by presenting a  united front against the oil companies. The stage was set  for a revolution in energy prices during the fourth Arab- Israeli war in October 1973, when Egypt and Syria  launched a surprise attack on Israel. OPEC then declared  an embargo on oil shipments to the United States, Israel’s  ally, and within a year crude oil prices quadrupled. Western  nations realized that the rapid price rise was economically  destructive, but they did nothing. Thus governments,  industry, and individuals had no other choice  than to deal piecemeal with the so-called oil shock—a  “shock that turned out to be an earthquake. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Coming on the heels of upheaval in the international  monetary system, the revolution in energy prices plunged  the world into its worst economic decline since the 1930s. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The energy-intensive industries that had driven the economy  up in the 1950s and 1960s now dragged it down. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 1011  Unemployment rose; productivity and living standards declined.  By 1976 a modest recovery was in progress. But  when a fundamentalist Islamic revolution struck Iran and  oil production collapsed in that country, the price of crude  oil doubled in 1979 and the world economy succumbed "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" One telling measure of the troubled economy was the  misery index, which combined rates of inflation and unemployment  in a single, powerfully emotional number.

Japan did better  than both Europe and the United States in this period. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, anxious observers,  recalling the disastrous consequences of the Great Depression,  worried that the Common Market would disintegrate  in the face of severe economic dislocation and that  economic nationalism would halt steps toward European  unity. Yet the Common Market—now officially known as  the European Economic Community—continued to attract  new members. In 1973 Denmark and Iceland, in addition  to Britain, finally joined. Greece joined in 1981,  and Portugal and Spain entered in 1986. The nations of  the European Economic Community also cooperated  more closely in international undertakings, and the movement  toward unity for western Europe stayed alive. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" The most pervasive consequences of economic stagnation  in the 1970s and early 1980s were probably psychological  and attitudinal.

"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The energetic response of governments to social needs  helps explain the sharp increase in total government  spending in most countries during the 1970s and early  1980s. In 1982 western European governments spent an  average of more than 50 percent of all national income,  as compared to only 37 percent fifteen years earlier. In all  countries, people were much more willing to see their  governments increase spending than raise taxes. This imbalance  contributed to the rapid growth of budget  deficits, national debts, and inflation. By the late 1970s,  a powerful reaction against government’s ever-increasing  role had set in, however, and Western governments were  gradually forced to introduce austerity measures to slow  the growth of public spending and the welfare state.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Part of a broad cultural shift toward greater conservatism,  growing voter dissatisfaction with government and  government spending helped bring Margaret Thatcher "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" (b. 1925) to power in Britain in 1979. Thatcher was determined  to scale back the role of government in Britain,  and in the 1980s—the “Thatcher years—she pushed  through a series of controversial “free-market policies  that transformed postwar Britain. In one of its most  popular actions, Thatcher’s Conservative government  encouraged low- and moderate-income renters in state- owned housing projects to buy their apartments at rock- bottom prices. This initiative, part of Thatcher’s broader  privatization campaign, created a whole new class of  property owners, thereby eroding the electoral base of  Britain’s socialist Labour Party. (See the feature “Individuals  in Society: Margaret Thatcher.)  President Ronald Reagan’s success in the United States  was more limited. With widespread popular support and  the agreement of most congressional Democrats as well as  Republicans, Reagan in 1981 pushed through major cuts  in income taxes all across the board. But Reagan and  Congress failed to cut government spending, which increased  as a percentage of national income in the course  of his presidency. Reagan’s massive military buildup was  partly responsible, but spending on social programs also  grew rapidly. The harsh recession of the early 1980s required  that the government spend more on unemployment  benefits, welfare benefits, and medical treatment for  the poor. Moreover, Reagan’s antiwelfare rhetoric mobilized  the liberal opposition and eventually turned many  moderates against him. Thus the budget deficit soared  and the U.S. government debt tripled in a decade. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The most striking temporary exception to the general  trend toward greater frugality was François Mitterrand  (1916–1996) of France. After his election as president  in 1981, Mitterrand led his Socialist Party on a lurch  to the left, launching a vast program of nationalization  and public investment designed to spend France  out of economic stagnation. By 1983 this attempt had  clearly failed. Mitterrand’s Socialist government was  then compelled to impose a wide variety of austerity  measures and to maintain those policies for the rest of the  decade. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" When governments were forced to restrain spending,  large scientific projects were often singled out for cuts.  These reductions reinforced the ongoing computer revolution,  which increased the efficiency of small businesses  and stimulated new ventures by young innovative entrepreneurs.  Big organizations lost some of their advantages  over small firms. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Individuals felt the impact of austerity at an early date,  for unlike governments, they could not pay their bills by  printing money and going ever further into debt. The  energy crisis of the 1970s forced them to re-examine not  only their fuel bills but also the whole pattern of self- indulgent materialism in the postwar years. A growing  number of experts and citizens concluded that the world  was running out of resources and decried wasteful industrial  practices and environmental pollution. In West Germany  young activists known as the Greens in 1979  founded a political party to fight for environmental causes.  The German Green movement elected some national  and local representatives, and similar parties developed  throughout Europe as environmentalism became a leading  societal concern. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Another consequence of austerity in both Europe and  North America was a leaner, tougher lifestyle in the 1970s  and early 1980s, featuring more attention to nutrition  and a passion for exercise. Correspondingly, there was  less blind reliance on medical science for good health and  a growing awareness that individuals had to accept a  large portion of the responsibility for illness and disease.  More people began to realize that they could substantially  increase their life spans simply by eating regular meals,  sleeping seven or eight hours each night, exercising two  or three times a week, maintaining moderate weight, forgoing  smoking, and using alcohol only in moderation. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Economic troubles also strengthened the new trends  within the family. Men and women were encouraged to  postpone marriage until they had put their careers on a  firm foundation, so the age of marriage rose sharply for  both sexes in many Western countries. Indeed, the very  real threat of unemployment—or “underemployment  in a dead-end job—seemed to shape the outlook of a  whole generation. College students of the 1980s were serious,  practical, and often conservative. As one young  woman at a French university told a reporter in 1985,  “Jobs are the big worry now, so everyone wants to learn  something practical.10 In France as elsewhere, the shift  away from the romantic visions and the political activism  of the late 1960s was astonishing. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Harder times also help explain why ever more women  entered or remained in the workforce after they did  marry. Although attitudes related to personal fulfillment  were one reason for the continuing increase—especially  for well-educated, upper-middle-class women—many  wives in poor and middle-class families simply had to  work outside the home because of economic necessity. As  in preindustrial Europe, the wife’s earnings provided the  margin of survival for millions of hard-pressed families. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Margaret Thatcher "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Margaret Thatcher (b. 1925), the first woman elected  to lead a major European state, stands as one of the most  significant leaders of the late twentieth century. The  controversial “Iron Lady attacked socialism, promoted  capitalism, and changed the face of modern Britain. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Born Margaret Roberts in a small city in southeastern  England, her father was a small shopkeeper who  instilled in his daughter the classic lower-middle-class  virtues—hard work, personal responsibility, and practical  education. A scholarship student at a local girls  school, she entered Oxford in 1943 to study chemistry  but soon found that politics was her passion. Elected  president of student Conservatives, she ran in 1950 for  Parliament in a solidly Labour district to gain experience.  Articulate and attractive, she also gained the attention  of Denis Thatcher, a wealthy businessman who  drove her to campaign appearances in his Jaguar. Married  a year later, the new Mrs. Thatcher abandoned  chemistry, went to law school, gave birth to twins, and  practiced as a tax attorney. In 1959, she returned to  politics and won a seat in the Conservative triumph. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" For the next fifteen years Mrs. Thatcher served in  Parliament and held various ministerial posts when the  Conservatives governed. In 1974, as the economy soured  and the Conservatives lost two close elections, a rebellious  Margaret Thatcher adroitly ran for the leadership  position of the Conservative Party and won. In the 1979  election, as the Labour government faced rampant inflation  and crippling strikes, Mrs. Thatcher promised to  reduce union power, lower taxes, and promote free markets.  Attracting swing votes from skilled workers, she  won and became prime minister. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A self-described “conviction politician, Thatcher  rejected postwar Keynesian efforts to manage the economy,  arguing that governments had created inflation by  printing too much money. Thus her government reduced  the supply of money and credit, and it refused to retreat  as interest rates and unemployment soared. Her popularity  plummeted. But Thatcher was saved by good  luck—and courage. In 1982, the generals ruling  Argentina suddenly seized the Falkland Islands off the  Argentine coast, the home of 1,800 British citizens. Ever  a staunch nationalist, Thatcher detached a naval armada  that recaptured the Falklands without a hitch. Britain  loved Thatcher’s determination, and the “Iron Lady  was re-elected in 1983. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Thatcher’s second term was the high point of her  success and influence. Her whole-hearted commitment  to privatization changed the face of British industry. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" More than fifty state- owned companies,  ranging from the state  tele-phone monopoly  to the nationalized steel  trust, were sold to  private investors. Small  investors were offered  shares at bargain prices  to promote “people’s  capitalism. Thatcher  also curbed the power  of British labor unions  with various laws and  actions. Most spectacularly,  when in 1984 the once-mighty coal miners rejected  more mine closings and doggedly struck for a  year, Thatcher stood firm and beat them. This outcome  had a profound psychological impact on the public. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Elected again in 1987, Thatcher became increasingly  stubborn, overconfident, and uncaring. Working well  with her ideological soul mate, U.S. president Ronald  Reagan, she opposed greater political and economic  unity within the European Community. This, coupled  with an unpopular effort to assert financial control  over city governments, proved her undoing. In 1990, as  in 1974, party stalwarts suddenly revolted and elected  a new Conservative leader. Raised to the peerage by  Queen Elizabeth II, the new Lady Thatcher then sat in  the largely ceremonial House of Lords. The transformational  changes of the Thatcher years endured, consolidated  by her Conservative successor and largely  accepted by the “New Labour prime minister, the  moderate Tony Blair. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Every human existence involves transcendence  and immanence at the same time; to go forward,  each existence must be maintained, for it to  expand toward the future it must integrate the  past, and while intercommunicating with others it  should find self-confirmation. These two  elements—maintenance and progression—are  implied in any living activity, and for man marriage  permits precisely a happy synthesis of the two. In  his occupation and his political life he encounters  change and progress, he senses his extension  through time and the universe; and when he is  tired of such roaming, he gets himself a home, a  fixed location, and an anchorage in the world. At  evening he restores his soul in the home, where  his wife takes care of his furnishings and children  and guards the things of the past that she keeps in  store. But she has no other job than to maintain "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" and provide for life in pure and unvarying  generality; she perpetuates the species without  change, she ensures the even rhythm of the days  and the continuity of the home, seeing to it that  the doors are locked. But she is allowed no direct  influence upon the future nor upon the world; she  reaches out beyond herself toward the social  group only through her husband as intermediary. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Marriage today still retains, for the most part,  this traditional form. . . . The male is called upon  for action, his vocation is to produce, fight, create,  progress, to transcend himself toward the totality  of the universe and the infinity of the future; but  traditional marriage does not invite woman to  transcend herself with him; it confines her in  immanence, shuts her up within the circle of  herself. She can thus propose to do nothing more  than construct a life of stable equilibrium in which  the present as a continuance of the past avoids the  menaces of tomorrow—that is, construct precisely  a life of happiness. . . . "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In domestic work, with or without the aid of  servants, woman makes her home her own, finds  social justification, and provides herself with an  occupation, an activity, that deals usefully and  satisfyingly with material objects—shining stoves,  fresh, clean clothes, bright copper, polished  furniture—but provides no escape from  immanence and little affirmation of  individuality.... Few tasks are more like the  torture of Sisyphus than housework, with its  endless repetition: the clean becomes soiled, the  soiled is made clean, over and over, day after day.  The housewife wears herself out marking time:  she makes nothing, simply perpetuates the  present. She never senses conquest of a positive  Good, but rather indefinite struggle against  negative Evil....Washing, ironing, sweeping,  ferreting out rolls of lint from under wardrobes—  all this halting of decay is also the denial of life; "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" \f for time simultaneously creates and destroys, and  only its negative aspect concerns the  housekeeper.... "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Thus woman’s work within the home gives her  no autonomy; it is not directly useful to society, it  does not open out on the future, it produces  nothing. It takes on meaning and dignity only as  it is linked with existent beings who reach out  beyond themselves, transcend themselves, toward  society in production and action. That is, far from  freeing the matron, her occupation makes her  dependent upon husband and children; she is  justified through them; but in their lives she is  only an inessential intermediary.... "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The tragedy of marriage is not that it fails to  assure woman the promised happiness—there is  no such thing as assurance in regard to  happiness—but that it mutilates her; it dooms her  to repetition and routine. The first twenty years of  woman’s life are extraordinarily rich, as we have  seen; she discovers the world and her destiny. At  twenty or thereabouts mistress of a home, bound  permanently to a man, a child in her arms, she  stands with her life virtually finished forever. Real  activities, real work, are the prerogative of her  man: she has mere things to occupy her which are  sometimes tiring but never fully satisfying. . . . "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Marriage should be a combining of two whole,  independent existences, not a retreat, an  annexation, a flight, a remedy.... The couple  should not be regarded as a unit, a close cell;  rather each individual should be integrated as such  in society at large, where each (whether male or  female) could flourish without aid; then  attachments could be formed in pure generosity  with another individual equally adapted to the  group, attachments that would be founded upon  the acknowledgment that both are free. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This balanced couple is not a utopian fancy:  such couples do exist, sometimes even within the  frame of marriage, most often outside it. Some  mates are united by a strong sexual love that  leaves them free in their friendships and in their  work; others are held together by a friendship that  does not preclude sexual liberty; more rare are  those who are at once lovers and friends but do  not seek in each other their sole reasons for living.  Many nuances are possible in the relations  between a man and a woman: in comradeship,  pleasure, trust, fondness, co-operation, and love,  they can be for each other the most abundant "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" • What does the study of history have  to tell us about the future?  The post–cold war years saw the realization of some of these hopes, but  the new era brought its own problems and tragedies. The cold war division  of Europe had kept a lid on ethnic conflicts and nationalism, which  suddenly burst into the open and led to a disastrous civil war in the former  Yugoslavia. Moreover, most western European economies were  plagued by high unemployment and struggling to adapt to the wide-open  global economy, which undermined cherished social benefits and complicated  the task of working together with the former communist states.  Thus in eastern Europe, the process of rebuilding shattered societies was  more difficult than optimists had envisioned in 1991, and in western Europe,  the road toward greater unity and eastward expansion proved  bumpy. Nevertheless, the will to undo the cold war division prevailed, and  in 2004 eight former communist countries as well as the islands of Cyprus  and Malta joined the European Union—a historic achievement.

In 1989 revolutions swept away communist  rule throughout the entire Soviet bloc.

Thus after forty years of  cold war division, Europe regained an underlying unity, as faith in democratic  government and some kind of market economy became the common  European creed. In 1991 hopes for peaceful democratic progress  throughout Europe were almost universal. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" More dramatically, the old, often contentious question  of relations with the Islamic world suddenly re-emerged as  a critical issue after the attack on New York’s World Trade  Center and the Pentagon in 2001. After the West united  in a quick response against the Taliban in Afghanistan,  the subsequent war in Iraq divided western Europe and  threatened the future of Western cooperation in world  affairs. The war in Iraq also complicated the ongoing integration  of Europe’s rapidly growing Muslim population. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The Decline of Communism  in Eastern Europe "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Following the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia, the crucial  event of the Brezhnev era (pages 997–999), the Soviet  Union repeatedly demonstrated that it remained a  harsh and aggressive dictatorship. It paid only lip service  to egalitarian ideology at home and was determined to  uphold its rule throughout eastern Europe. Thus the Soviet  Union eventually crushed the Solidarity movement  in Poland, the powerful, peaceful challenge to Communist  rule in Poland in the early 1980s. Periodic efforts to  achieve fundamental political change were doomed to  failure sooner or later—or so it seemed to most Western  experts into the mid-1980s. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" And then Mikhail Gorbachev burst on the scene. The  new Soviet leader opened an era of reform that was as  sweeping as it was unexpected. Although many believed  that Gorbachev would soon fall from power, his reforms  rapidly transformed Soviet culture and politics, and they  drastically reduced cold war tensions. But communism,  which Gorbachev wanted so desperately to revitalize in  order to save it, continued to decline as a functioning system  throughout the Soviet bloc. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" • In what ways did Solidarity confront the communist  system in Poland, and how did Mikhail Gorbachev try to  reverse the decline of communism in the Soviet Union?  Solidarity in Poland "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Gorbachev’s reforms interacted with a resurgence of popular  protest in the Soviet Union’s satellite empire. Developments  in Poland were most striking and significant. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Poland had been an unruly satellite from the beginning.  Stalin said that introducing communism to Poland was like  putting a saddle on a cow. Efforts to saddle the cow—  really a spirited stallion—led to widespread riots in 1956  (see page 997). As a result, Polish Communists dropped  their efforts to impose Soviet-style collectivization on  the peasants and to break the Roman Catholic Church.  Most agricultural land remained in private hands, and the  Catholic Church thrived. Thus the Communists failed to  monopolize society. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" They also failed to manage the economy effectively.  Even the booming 1960s saw little economic improvement.  In 1970 Poland’s working class rose again in angry  protest. A new Communist leader came to power, and  he wagered that massive inflows of Western capital and  technology, especially from rich and now-friendly West  Germany (see page 1008), could produce a Polish “economic  miracle. Instead, bureaucratic incompetence  and the first oil shock in 1973 put the economy into a  nosedive. Workers, intellectuals, and the church became  increasingly restive. Then the real Polish miracle occurred:  Cardinal Karol Wojtyla, archbishop of Cracow, was  elected pope in 1978. In June 1979, he returned  from Rome, preaching love of Christ and country and  the “inalienable rights of man. Pope John Paul II drew  enormous crowds and electrified the Polish nation.  The economic crisis became a moral and spiritual crisis  as well. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In August 1980, the sixteen thousand workers at the  gigantic Lenin Shipyards in Gdansk (formerly known as  Danzig) laid down their tools and occupied the plant. As  other workers joined “in solidarity, the strikers advanced  revolutionary demands, including the right to  form free-trade unions, freedom of speech, release of political  prisoners, and economic reforms. After eighteen  days of shipyard occupation, the government gave in and  accepted the workers’ demands in the Gdansk Agreement.  In a state where the Communist Party claimed to  rule on behalf of the proletariat, a working-class revolt  had won an unprecedented victory. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" 1021  published its own newspapers and cultural and intellectual  freedom blossomed in Poland. Solidarity’s leaders  had tremendous support, and the ever-present threat of  calling a nationwide strike gave them real power in ongoing  negotiations with the Communist bosses. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" But if Solidarity had power, it did not try to take the  reins of government in 1981. History, the Brezhnev  Doctrine, and virulent attacks from communist neighbors  all seemed to guarantee the intervention of the Red  Army and a terrible bloodbath if Polish Communists  “lost control. Thus the Solidarity revolution remained a  “self-limiting revolution aimed at defending the cultural  and trade-union freedoms won in the Gdansk Agreement,  and it refused to use force to challenge directly the  Communist monopoly of political power. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Solidarity’s combination of strength and moderation  postponed a showdown, as the Soviet Union played a  waiting game of threats and pressure. After a confrontation  in March 1981, Walesa settled for minor government  concessions, and Solidarity dropped plans for a  massive general strike. Criticism of Walesa’s moderate  leadership grew, and Solidarity lost its cohesiveness. The  worsening economic crisis also encouraged grassroots  radicalism, as the Polish Communist leadership shrewdly  denounced Solidarity for promoting economic collapse  and provoking Soviet invasion. In December 1981,  Communist leader General Wojciech Jaruzelski suddenly  struck, proclaiming martial law, arresting Solidarity’s  leaders, and “saving the nation. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Outlawed and driven underground, Solidarity fought  successfully to maintain its organization and to voice the  aspirations of the Polish masses after 1981. Part of the  reason for the union’s survival was the government’s unwillingness  (and probably its inability) to impose full-scale  terror. Moreover, millions of Poles decided to continue  acting as if they were free, even though they were not.  Cultural and intellectual life remained extremely vigorous  as the faltering Polish economy continued to deteriorate.  Thus popular support for outlawed Solidarity remained  strong under martial law in the 1980s, preparing the way  for the union’s political rebirth toward the end of the  decade. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The rise and survival of Solidarity showed the desire of  millions of eastern Europeans for greater political liberty  and the enduring appeal of cultural freedom, trade-union  rights, patriotic nationalism, and religious feeling. Not  least, Solidarity’s challenge encouraged fresh thinking in  the Soviet Union, ever the key to lasting change in the  Eastern bloc. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Fundamental change in Russian history has often come  in short, intensive spurts, which contrast vividly with long  periods of immobility. The era of reform launched by  Mikhail Gorbachev in 1985 was one such decisive transformation.  Gorbachev’s initiatives brought political and  cultural liberalization to the Soviet Union, and they then  permitted democracy and national self-determination to  triumph spectacularly in the old satellite empire and  eventually in the Soviet Union itself, although this was  certainly not Gorbachev’s original intention. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As we have seen (page 998), the Soviet Union’s Communist  Party elite seemed secure in the early 1980s as far  as any challenge from below was concerned. The long- established system of administrative controls continued  to stretch downward from the central ministries and state  committees to provincial cities, and from there to facto"}

At each level of this  massive state bureaucracy, the overlapping hierarchy of  the Communist Party, with its 17.5 million members,  continued to watch over all decisions and manipulate  every aspect of national life. Organized opposition was  impossible, and average people simply left politics to the  bosses. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Yet the massive state and party bureaucracy was a  mixed blessing. It safeguarded the elite, but it promoted  apathy in the masses. Therefore, when the ailing Brezhnev  finally died in 1982, his successor, the long-time  chief of the secret police, Yuri Andropov (1914–1984),  tried to invigorate the system. Relatively little came of  these efforts, but they combined with a sharply worsening  economic situation to set the stage for the emergence  in 1985 of Mikhail Gorbachev (b. 1931), the most vigorous  Soviet leader in a generation.

Thus Gorbachev  (and his intelligent, influential wife, Raisa, a dedicated  professor of Marxist-Leninist thought) wanted to save the  Soviet system by revitalizing it with fundamental reforms.  Gorbachev was also an idealist. He wanted to improve  conditions for ordinary citizens. Understanding that the  endless waste and expense of the cold war arms race had  had a disastrous impact on living conditions in the Soviet  Union, he realized that improvement at home required  better relations with the West.

Long-banned and vilified émigré writers sold millions of  copies of their works in new editions, while denunciations  of Stalin and his terror became standard fare in plays and  movies. Thus initial openness in government pronouncements  quickly went much further than Gorbachev intended  and led to something approaching free speech and  free expression, a veritable cultural revolution.

{"prompt":"","completion":" The first set of reform policies was designed to transform  and restructure the economy, in order to provide for the  real needs of the Soviet population. To accomplish this  economic “restructuring, or perestroika, Gorbachev and  his supporters permitted an easing of government price  controls on some goods, more independence for state  enterprises, and the setting up of profit-seeking private  cooperatives to provide personal services for consumers.  These timid economic reforms initially produced a few  improvements, but shortages then grew as the economy  stalled at an intermediate point between central planning  and free-market mechanisms. By late 1988, widespread  consumer dissatisfaction posed a serious threat to Gorbachev’s  leadership and the entire reform program. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Solidarity and the Polish people led the way to revolution  in eastern Europe. In 1988 widespread labor unrest, raging  inflation, and the outlawed Solidarity’s refusal to  cooperate with the military government had brought  Poland to the brink of economic collapse. Thus Solidarity  skillfully pressured Poland’s frustrated Communist  leaders into another round of negotiations that might  work out a sharing of power to resolve the political stalemate  and the economic crisis. The subsequent agreement  in early 1989 legalized Solidarity and declared that a  large minority of representatives to the Polish parliament  would be chosen by free elections in June 1989. Still  guaranteed a parliamentary majority and expecting to  win many of the contested seats, the Communists believed  that their rule was guaranteed for four years and  that Solidarity would keep the workers in line. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Lacking access to the state-run media, Solidarity succeeded  nonetheless in mobilizing the country and winning  most of the contested seats in an overwhelming victory.  Moreover, many angry voters crossed off the names of unopposed  party candidates, so that the Communist Party  failed to win the majority its leaders had anticipated. Solidarity  members jubilantly entered the Polish parliament,  and a dangerous stalemate quickly developed. But Solidarity  leader Lech Walesa, a gifted politician who always repudiated  violence, adroitly obtained a majority by securing  the allegiance of two minor procommunist parties that had  been part of the coalition government after World War II.  In August 1989, the editor of Solidarity’s weekly newspaper  was sworn in as Poland’s new noncommunist leader. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In its first year and a half, the new Solidarity government  cautiously introduced revolutionary political changes. It  eliminated the hated secret police, the Communist ministers  in the government, and finally Jaruzelski himself,  but it did so step by step in order to avoid confrontation  with the army or the Soviet Union.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Hungary followed Poland. Hungary’s Communist  Party boss, János Kádár, had permitted liberalization of  the rigid planned economy after the 1956 uprising in exchange  for political obedience and continued Communist  control. In May 1988, in an effort to retain power by  granting modest political concessions, the party replaced  Kádár with a reform communist. But opposition groups  rejected piecemeal progress, and in the summer of 1989  the Hungarian Communist Party agreed to hold free  elections in early 1990. Welcoming Western investment  and moving rapidly toward multiparty democracy, Hungary’s  Communists now enjoyed considerable popular  support, and they believed, quite mistakenly it turned  out, that they could defeat the opposition in the upcoming  elections. In an effort to strengthen their support at  home and also put pressure on East Germany’s hard-line  Communist regime, the Hungarians opened their border  to East Germans and tore down the barbed-wire “iron  curtain with Austria. Thus tens of thousands of dissatisfied  East German “vacationers began pouring into  Hungary, crossed into Austria as refugees, and continued  on to immediate resettlement in thriving West Germany.

{"prompt":"","completion":" The flight of East Germans led to the rapid growth of  a homegrown protest movement in East Germany.

These “stayers  failed to convince the “leavers, however, who continued  to flee the country en masse. In a desperate attempt to  stabilize the situation, the East German government  opened the Berlin Wall in November 1989, and people  danced for joy atop that grim symbol of the prison state.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Finally, in the summer of 1990, the crucial international  aspect of German unification was successfully resolved.  Unification would once again make Germany the strongest  state in central Europe and would directly affect the security  of the Soviet Union. But Gorbachev swallowed hard—  Western cartoonists showed Stalin turning over in his  grave—and negotiated the best deal he could. In a historic  agreement signed by Gorbachev and Kohl in July 1990, a  uniting Germany solemnly affirmed its peaceful intentions  and pledged never to develop nuclear, biological, or chemical  weapons. Germany also sweetened the deal by promising  to make enormous loans to the hard-pressed Soviet  Union.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Reacting vigorously to free Kuwait, the United States  mobilized the U.N. Security Council, which in August  1990 imposed a strict naval blockade on Iraq. Receiving  the support of some Arab states, as well as of Great Britain  and France, the United States also landed 500,000 American  soldiers in Saudi Arabia near the border of Kuwait.  When a defiant Saddam Hussein refused to withdraw from  Kuwait, the Security Council authorized the U.S.-led military  coalition to attack Iraq.

Thus, although Europe in the 1990s was a collage  of diverse peoples with their own politics, cultures,  and histories, the entire continent shared an underlying  network of common developments and challenges. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Of critical importance, in economic affairs European  leaders embraced, or at least accepted, a large part of the  neoliberal, free-market vision of capitalist development.  This was most strikingly the case in eastern Europe,  where states such as Poland and Hungary implemented  market reforms and sought to create vibrant capitalist  economies. Thus postcommunist governments in eastern  Europe freed prices, turned state enterprises over to private  owners, and sought to move toward strong currencies  and balanced budgets. Milder doses of this same  free-market medicine were administered by politicians  and big business to the lackluster economies of western  Europe. These initiatives and proposals for further  changes marked a considerable modification in western  Europe’s still-dominant welfare capitalism, which featured  government intervention, high taxes, and high levels  of social benefits. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Two factors were particularly important in accounting  for this ongoing shift from welfare state activism to  tough-minded capitalism. First, Europeans were only following  practices and ideologies revived and enshrined in  the 1980s in the United States and Great Britain (see  page 1012). Western Europeans especially took American  prescriptions more seriously because U.S. prestige  and power were so high after the United States “won the  cold war and because the U.S. economy continued to "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" 1031  outperform its western European counterparts in the  Clinton years. Second, the deregulation of markets and  the privatization of state-controlled enterprises were an  integral part of the powerful trend toward a wide-open,  wheeler-dealer global economy. The rules of the global  economy, which were laid down by Western governments,  multinational corporations, and international financial  organizations such as the International Monetary  Fund (IMF), called for the free movement of capital and  goods and services, as well as low inflation and limited  government deficits. Accepting these rules and attempting  to follow them was the price of full participation in  the global economy. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The ongoing computer and electronics revolution  strengthened the move toward a global economy. That  revolution thrived on the diffusion of ever-cheaper computational  and informational capacity to small research  groups and private businesses, which were both cause  and effect of the revolution itself. By the 1990s, an inexpensive  personal computer had the power of a 1950s  mainframe that filled a room and cost hundreds of thousands  of dollars. The computer revolution reduced the  costs of distance, speeding up communications and helping  businesses tap cheaper labor overseas. Reducing the  friction of distance made threats of moving factories  abroad ring true and helped hold down wages at home. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Globalization, the emergence of a freer global economy,  probably did speed up world economic growth as  enthusiasts invariably claimed, but it also had powerful  and quite negative social consequences. Millions of ordinary  citizens in western Europe believed that global capitalism  and freer markets were undermining hard-won  social achievements. As in the United States and Great  Britain in the 1980s, the public in other countries generally  associated globalization with the increased unemployment  that accompanied corporate downsizing, the  efforts to reduce the power of labor unions, and, above  all, government plans to reduce social benefits. The reaction  was particularly intense in France and Germany,  where unions remained strong and socialists championed  a minimum of change in social policies. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Indeed, the broad movement toward neoliberal global  development sparked a powerful counterattack as the  1990s ended. Financial crises, which devastated many of  Asia’s smaller economies and threatened to spread, triggered  this reaction.

Above all, critics insisted that globalization  hurt the world’s poor, because multinational  corporations destroyed local industries and paid pitiful  wages, and because international financial organizations "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" The resurgence of nationalism in the 1990s led to terrible  tragedy and bloodshed in parts of eastern Europe, as it  did in several hot spots in Africa and Asia. During the civil  wars in Yugoslavia, many observers feared that national  and ethnic hatreds would spread throughout eastern Europe  and infect western Europe in the form of racial hostility  toward minorities and immigrants. Yet if nationalist  and racist incidents were a recurring European theme, they  remained limited in the extent of their damage. Of critical  importance in this regard was the fact that all European  states wished to become or remain full-fledged members  of the European society of nations and to join eventually  an ever-expanding European Community, renamed the  European Union in 1993. States that embraced national  hatred and ethnic warfare, most notably Serbia, were  branded as outlaws and boycotted and isolated by the European  Union and the international community. The  process of limiting resurgent nationalism in Europe was almost  as significant as the resurgence itself. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Recasting Russia "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Politics and economics were closely intertwined in Russia  after the attempted Communist coup in 1991 and the dissolution  of the Soviet Union. President Boris Yeltsin, his  democratic supporters, and his economic ministers wanted  to create conditions that would prevent forever a return  to communism and would also right the faltering economy.  Following the example of some postcommunist  governments in eastern Europe and agreeing with those  Western advisers who argued that private economies  were always best, the Russian reformers opted in January  1992 for breakneck liberalization. Their “shock therapy  freed prices on 90 percent of all Russian goods, with the  exception of bread, vodka, oil, and public transportation.  The government also launched a rapid privatization of industry  and turned thousands of factories and mines over  to new private companies. Each citizen received a voucher  worth 10,000 rubles (about $22) to buy stock in private  companies, but control of the privatized companies usually  remained in the hands of the old bosses, the managers  and government officials from the communist era. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" President Yeltsin and his economic reformers believed  that shock therapy would revive production and bring  prosperity after a brief period of hardship. The results of  the reforms were in fact quite different. Prices increased  250 percent on the very first day, and they kept on soaring,  increasing twenty-six times in the course of 1992. At the "}

Throughout  1995 rapid but gradually slowing inflation raged, and output  continued to fall. According to most estimates, in  1996 the Russian economy produced at least one-third  and possibly as much as one-half less than in 1991. Only in  1997 did the economy stop declining, before crashing yet  again in 1998 in the wake of Asia’s financial crisis. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Rapid economic liberalization worked poorly in Russia  for several reasons. Soviet industry had been highly monopolized  and strongly tilted toward military goods. Production  of many items had been concentrated in one or  two gigantic factories or in interconnected combines that  supplied the entire economy. With privatization these  powerful state monopolies became powerful private monopolies,  which cut production and raised prices in order  to maximize their financial returns. Moreover, powerful  managers and bureaucrats forced Yeltsin’s government to  hand out enormous subsidies and credits to reinforce the  positions of big firms and to avoid bankruptcies and the  discipline of a free market. The managerial elite also combined  with criminal elements to intimidate would-be rivals  and prevent the formation of new businesses.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Developments in eastern Europe shared important similarities  with those in Russia, as many of the problems were  the same. Thus the postcommunist states of the former  satellite empire worked to replace state planning and socialism  with market mechanisms and private property.  Western-style electoral politics also took hold, and as in  Russia, these politics were marked by intense battles between  presidents and parliaments and by weak political  parties. The social consequences of these revolutionary  changes were similar to those in Russia. Ordinary citizens  and the elderly were once again the big losers, while the  young and the ex-Communists were the big winners.  Inequalities between richer and poorer regions also increased.  Capital cities such as Warsaw, Prague, and Budapest  concentrated wealth, power, and opportunity as never  before, while provincial centers stagnated and old industrial  areas declined. Crime and gangsterism increased in  the streets and in the executive suites. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Yet the 1990s saw more than a difficult transition, with  high social costs, to market economies and freely elected  governments in eastern Europe. Many citizens had never  fully accepted communism, which they equated with Russian  imperialism and the loss of national independence.  The joyous crowds that toppled communist regimes in  1989 believed that they were liberating the nation as well  as the individual. Thus communism died and nationalism  was reborn. "}

The reasons  for these successes included considerable experience with  limited market reforms before 1989, flexibility and lack  of dogmatism in government policy, and an enthusiastic  embrace of capitalism by a new entrepreneurial class. In  the first five years of reform, Poland created twice as  many new businesses as Russia, with a total population  only one-fourth as large. "}

After Czechoslovakia’s “Velvet Revolution in 1989,  Havel and the Czech parliament accepted a “velvet divorce  in 1993 when Slovakian nationalists wanted to  break off and form their own state.

Membership required  many proofs of character and stability, however.  Providing these proofs and endorsed by the Clinton administration,  Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic  were accepted into the NATO alliance in 1997.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Unity and Identity in Western Europe "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The movement toward western European unity, which  since the late 1940s had inspired practical politicians seeking  economic recovery and idealistic visionaries imagining  a European identity that transcended destructive national  rivalries, received a powerful second wind in the mid1980s.  The Single European Act of 1986 laid down a detailed  legal framework for establishing a single market,  which would add the free movement of labor, capital, and  services to the existing free trade in goods. With work  proceeding vigorously toward the single market, which  went into effect in 1993 as the European Community  proudly rechristened itself the European Union (EU),  French president François Mitterrand and German chancellor  Helmut Kohl took the lead in pushing for a monetary  union of EU members. After long negotiations and  compromises, designed especially to overcome Britain’s  long-standing reluctance to cede aspects of sovereignty, in  December 1991 the member states reached an agreement  in the Dutch town of Maastricht. The Maastricht treaty  set strict financial criteria for joining the proposed monetary  union, with its single currency, and set 1999 as the  target date for its establishment. The treaty also anticipated  the development of common policies on defense  and foreign affairs after achieving monetary union. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Western European elites and opinion makers generally  supported the decisive step toward economic integration  embodied in the Maastricht treaty. They saw monetary  union as a means of coping with Europe’s ongoing economic  problems, imposing financial discipline, cutting  costs, and reducing high unemployment. European elites  also viewed monetary union as a historic, irreversible step  toward a basic political unity. This unity would allow western  Europe as a whole to regain its rightful place in world  politics and to deal with the United States as an equal. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 1039  The Maastricht plan for monetary union encountered  widespread skepticism and considerable opposition from  ordinary people, leftist political parties, and patriotic nationalists.  Ratification votes were close, especially when  the public rather than the politicians could vote yes or no  on the question. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" There were several interrelated reasons for this widespread  popular opposition. Many people resented the  unending flow of rules handed down by the EU’s ever- growing bureaucracy in Brussels, which sought to impose  common standards on everything from cheese to  day care and undermined national practices and local traditions.  Moreover, increased unity meant yielding still  more power to distant “Eureaucrats and political insiders,  thereby undermining popular sovereignty and democratic  control through national politics and electoral  competition. Above all, many ordinary citizens feared  that the new Europe was being made at their expense.  Joining the monetary union required national governments  to meet stringent fiscal standards and impose  budget cuts. The resulting reductions in health care and  social benefits hit ordinary citizens and did nothing to reduce  western Europe’s high unemployment rate. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Events in France dramatically illustrated these developments.  Mitterrand’s Socialist government had been forced  to adopt conservative financial policies in the 1980s (see  page 1012), and in early 1993 a coalition of conservatives  and moderates won an overwhelming victory by promising  a vigorous attack on unemployment. However, the  Maastricht criteria soon forced the new government to  resume deficit-reducing cuts in health benefits and transportation  services. France’s powerful unions and railroad  workers responded with a crippling national strike that  shut down rail traffic throughout France for almost a  month. Yet despite the enormous inconvenience and  economic damage, many people felt that the transport  workers were also fighting for them. The government  had to back down, and soon the Socialists returned to  power. The Socialists quickly passed a controversial new  law to reduce the legal workweek to thirty-five hours in  an attempt to reduce France’s stubborn 12 percent unemployment  rate without budget-busting spending.  More generally, much of the western European public increasingly  saw laws to cut the workweek and share the  work as a way to reconcile desires for social welfare and a  humane market economy with financial discipline and  global competition.

The EU constitution  created a president, a foreign minister, and a voting system  weighted to reflect the number of people in the different  states. The result of intense debate and many compromises,  the constitution moved toward a more centralized  federal system in several fields, but each state retained veto  power in the most sensitive areas, such as taxation, social  policy, and foreign affairs. In order for the constitution to  take effect, each and every EU country needed to ratify it. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Nine countries, led by Germany, Italy, and seven eastern  European members, soon ratified the constitution by parliamentary  action, while seven states planned to go beyond  the political elites and let the voters decide. The referendum  campaigns were noisy and contentious, as generally  well-informed citizens debated whether the new constitution  surrendered too much national sovereignty to an  emerging central European government in Brussels.  British voters were considered most likely to vote no, but  both the French and the Dutch beat them to it, rejecting  the new constitution by clear majorities. Nationalist fears  about losing sovereignty were matched by fears that an unwieldy  European Union would grow to include Ukraine,  Georgia, and Muslim Turkey—countries with cultures and  histories that were very different from those in western  Europe. Thus the long postwar march toward ever greater  European unity stopped, or at least stalled, and the European  Union concentrated on fully integrating the new  eastern European members. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" New Challenges in the Twenty- first Century "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" As the twenty-first century opened and the historic movement  toward European unity began to include post- communist eastern Europe, European society faced new  uncertainties. Of great significance, Europe continued  to experience a remarkable baby bust, as birthrates fell  to levels that seemed to promise a shrinking and aging  population in the future. At the same time, the peaceful,  wealthy European Union attracted rapidly growing numbers  of refugees and illegal immigrants from the former  Soviet Union, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. The unexpected  arrival of so many newcomers raised many perplexing  questions and prompted serious thinking about  European identity, Europe’s humanitarian mission, and  Europe’s place in the world. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" • Why did the prospect of population decline, the reality of  large-scale immigration, and concern for human rights  emerge as critical issues in contemporary Europe?  The Prospect of Population Decline "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Population is still growing rapidly in many poor countries,  but this is not the case in the world’s industrialized nations.  In 2000, women in developed countries had only "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 1.6 children on average; only in the United States did  women have, almost exactly, the 2.1 children necessary to  maintain a stable population. In European countries, where  women have been steadily having fewer babies since the  1950s, national fertility rates ranged from 1.2 to 1.8 children  per woman. Italy, once renowned for big Catholic  families, had achieved the world’s lowest birthrate—a  mere 1.2 babies per woman. In 2006, the European fertility  rate was little changed at about 1.4 children per  woman.  If the current baby bust continues, the long-term consequences  could be dramatic, though hardly predictable.  At the least, Europe’s population would decline and age.  Projections for Germany are illustrative. Total German  population, barring much greater immigration, would  gradually decline from 82 million in 2001 to only 62 million  around 2050. The number of people of working age  would drop by a third, and almost half of the population  would be over sixty. Social security taxes paid by the shrinking  labor force would need to soar for the skyrocketing  costs of pensions and health care for seniors to be met—a  recipe for generational tension and conflict.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Why, in times of peace, were Europeans failing to reproduce  themselves? Certainly the uneven, uninspiring European  economic conditions of the 1980s and much of the  1990s played some role. High unemployment fell heavily  on young people and often frustrated their plans to settle  down and have children. Some observers also argued that  a partial rejection of motherhood and parenting was critical.  They noted that many women chose to have no children  or only one child. By 2000, 30 percent of German  women born in 1965 were childless, whereas 90 percent  would have had children in earlier generations. In the  Catholic countries of southern Europe, where strong pressures  to have children still exist, a quarter of the couples  were fulfilling their “social duty with a single child. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In our view, the ongoing impact of careers for married  women and the related drive for gender equality remained  the decisive factors in the long-term decline of  postwar birthrates. After World War II, Western women  married early, had their children early, and then turned  increasingly to full-time employment, where they suffered  from the discrimination that drove the women’s  movement (see pages 1009–1010). As the twenty-first  century opened, women had attained many (but not all)  of their objectives. They did as well as or better than men  in school, and educated young women earned almost as  much as their male counterparts. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Research showed that European women (and men) in  their twenties, thirties, and early forties still wanted to  have two or even three children—about the same number  as their parents had wanted. But unlike their parents,  young couples did not realize their ideal family size. Many  women postponed the birth of their first child into their  thirties in order to finish their education and establish  themselves in their careers. Then, finding that raising even  one child was more difficult and time-consuming than anticipated,  new mothers tended to postpone and eventually  forgo a second child. This was especially true of professional  women. The better educated and the more economically  successful a woman was, the more likely she was  to stop with a single child or to have no children at all. "}

Some migrants entered  the European Union legally, but increasing numbers  were smuggled in past beefed-up border patrols. Large- scale immigration emerged as a contentious and critical  challenge. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Historically a source rather than a destination of immigrants,  booming western Europe drew heavily on North  Africa and Turkey for manual laborers from about 1960  until about 1973, when unemployment started to rise  and governments abruptly stopped the inflow. Many foreign  workers stayed on, however, eventually bringing  their families to western Europe and establishing permanent  immigrant communities there. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" A new and different surge of migration into western  Europe began in the 1990s. The collapse of communism  in the East and savage civil wars in Yugoslavia sent hundreds  of thousands of refugees fleeing westward. Equally  brutal conflicts in Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, and  Rwanda—to name only four countries—brought thousands  more from Asia and Africa. Illegal immigration  into the European Union also exploded, rising from an  estimated 50,000 people in 1993 to perhaps 500,000 a  decade later. This movement exceeded the estimated  300,000 unauthorized foreigners entering the United  States each year. "}

Ruthless Russian-speaking gangs played an  important role in the trade, passing their human cargo  across Russia and through the Balkans to western Europe.

The nearby  agonies of barbarism and war in the former Yugoslavia  vividly recalled the horrors of World War II, and they cast  in bold relief the ever-present reality of collective violence  in today’s world. At the same time, western European  countries were generally doing their best to limit or expel  the foreigners arriving at their gates, as we have seen. This  ongoing rejection gave some Europeans a guilty conscience  and a feeling that they needed to do more when  they had so much and so many others had so little. As a  result, European intellectuals and opinion makers began  to envision a new historic mission for Europe—the promotion  of domestic peace and human rights in those  lands plagued by instability, violence, and oppression. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" European leaders and humanitarians believed that Europe’s  mission required more global agreements and new  international institutions to set moral standards and to  regulate countries, political leaders, armies, corporations,  and individuals. In practice, this meant more curbs on the  sovereign rights of the world’s states, just as the states of  the European Union had imposed increasingly strict standards  of behavior on themselves in order to secure the  rights and welfare of EU citizens. As Nicole Gnesotto, the  director of the European Union’s institute, concluded,  the EU has a “historical responsibility to make morality  “a basis of policy, because “human rights are more important  than states’ rights.3 In general, the United States  reacted coolly to the idea of preferring human rights to  states’ rights.

{"prompt":"","completion":" As the twenty-first century opened, western Europeans  also pushed as best they could to extend their  broad-based concept of social and economic rights to the  world’s poor countries. These efforts were related to  sharp criticism of globalization and unrestrained capitalism  (see pages 1031–1032), criticism that helped socialists  regain power in several countries in the European  Union. Quite typically, Europe’s moderate social democrats  combined with human rights campaigners in 2001  to help African governments secure drastic price cuts  from the big international drug companies on the drug  cocktails needed to combat Africa’s AIDS crisis.

By mid- October 2001 American special forces on the ground  were directing precision air strikes that devastated Taliban  and al-Qaeda troops, and a rejuvenated Northern Alliance  took the offensive. In mid-November the Taliban collapsed,  and jubilant crowds in the capital of Kabul welcomed  Northern Alliance soldiers as liberators. Afghan  opposition leaders and United Nations mediators worked  out plans for a new broad-based government, while  American planes, ground troops, and tribal fighters  searched for bin Laden and his die-hard supporters in  their mountain hideaways.

They also  developed a hatred of most existing Arab governments,  which they viewed as corrupt, un-Islamic, and unresponsive  to the needs of ordinary Muslims.

As soon as he was elected in  2000, President Bush and his most influential advisers,  led by Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of Defense  Donald Rumsfeld, began to consider how to overthrow  Iraq’s Saddam Hussein and remake the Middle  East. Paul O’Neill, Bush’s secretary of the treasury,  summed up discussions on Iraq by the president and  his cabinet this way: “From the start, they were building  the case against Hussein and looking at how we could  take him out and change Iraq into a new country. And,  if we did that, it would solve everything.6 And indeed,  many in the administration believed that the United  States could create a democratic, pro-American Iraq, an  Iraq that would transform the Middle East, make peace  with Israel, provide easy access to the world’s second- largest oil reserves, and show small states the folly of  opposing the United States.

Moreover, large numbers of Americans  shared widespread doubts in Europe about the legality—  and wisdom—of an American attack on Iraq and argued  for a peaceful settlement of the Iraqi weapons crisis. So  the Bush administration reluctantly agreed to new Security  Council resolutions requiring Iraq to accept the return  of United Nations weapons inspectors and destroy  any remaining prohibited weapons.

However, the  United States and Britain said Iraq was hiding prohibited  weapons, moved armies to the Middle East, and lobbied  for a new United Nations resolution authorizing immediate  military action against Iraq. The world followed the  debates in the Security Council with unprecedented interest  and generally opposed an attack on Iraq.

Saddam’s dictatorship preached Arab and Iraqi nationalism,  but it relied heavily on the Sunni minority—20 percent  of the population—and repressed the Shi’ites, who  made up 60 percent of the population. Jailed or ousted  from their positions by American forces, top Sunnis  quickly turned against the occupation, rallied their supporters,  and launched an armed insurgency.

Then, in February 2005 in a carefully  planned operation, they blew up the beautiful Golden  Mosque of Samarra, one of the most sacred shrines of Shi’ite  Islam.

{"prompt":"","completion":" These spectacular attacks and lesser actions by Islamic  militants sharpened the European debate on immigration  (see pages 1042–1044). A shrill chorus warned that, in  addition to the security danger, Europe’s rapidly growing  Muslim population posed a dire threat to the West’s entire  Enlightenment tradition, which embraced freedom of  thought, representative government, toleration, separation  of church and state, and, more recently, equal rights  for women and gays. Islamic extremists and radical clerics  settled in Europe were, the critics claimed, rejecting these  fundamental Western values and preaching instead the supremacy  of Islamic laws for Muslims living in Europe, and  even for non-Muslim Europeans on some issues. Moreover,  the critics claimed, many “moderate Islamic teachers  were really anti-Western radicals playing for time. (See  the feature “Individuals in Society: Tariq Ramadan.)  And time was on the side of Euro-Islam. Europe’s Muslim  population, estimated at 15 million in 2006, appeared  likely to double to 30 million by 2025, and it would increase  rapidly thereafter as the number of non-Europeans  plummeted (see pages 1041–1042). "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Admitting that Islamic extremism could pose a serious  challenge, many mainstream observers focused instead  on the problem of immigrant integration. Whereas the  first generation of Muslim immigrants—predominately  Turks in Germany, Algerians in France, Pakistanis in  Britain, and Moroccans in the Netherlands—had found  jobs as unskilled workers in Europe’s great postwar  boom, they and their children had been hard hit after  1973 by the general economic downturn. Immigrants  also suffered from the ongoing decline of European  manufacturing due to globalization. Provided for modestly  by the welfare state and housed minimally in ugly  housing projects, many Muslims of the second and third "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" 1049  generations were finding themselves locked out in their  adopted countries. In short, economics, inadequate job  training, and discrimination trumped religion and extremist  teachings. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This argument was strengthened by widespread rioting  in France in November 2005 that saw hundreds of  young second- and third-generation Muslim immigrants  go on a rampage. Almost always French by birth, language,  and education, marauding groups of “Arabs  torched hundreds of automobiles night after night in  Paris suburbs and large cities. (See the feature “Listening  to the Past: The French Riots: Will They Change Anything?  on pages 1054–1055.) The rioters complained  bitterly of very high unemployment, systematic discrimination,  and exclusion. Religious ideology appeared almost  nonexistent in their thinking. Studies sparked by  the rioting in France found poor, alienated Muslims in  unwholesome ghettos throughout western Europe. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Although Muslim immigrants in the United States  certainly experienced increased hostility after the September  11 attack, it was generally recognized that they  were integrating more successfully with their adopted  homeland than were their European counterparts. This is  partly because the United States believes that it has always  been a nation of immigrants, whereas the European  ideal remains the homogeneous national state. Equally  important, Muslim immigrants to the United States have  often been well educated, have come from several countries  speaking different languages, and have spread out  within cities and across the country. Muslim immigrants  to western Europe, usually a larger percentage of the  host country’s population than in America, have generally  been poor rural people with limited education who  came to do manual labor. In each of the leading host  countries, they came mainly from a single Muslim country  and then lived together on the fringes of the largest  cities. Muslim immigrants to the United States brought  more “human capital, and this facilitated more successful  integration. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Finally, the fact that Americans and western Europeans  have gone their separate ways on religion probably impacts  their relations with their Muslim citizens. A large  though declining number of Americans still take religion  seriously, whereas western Europeans have largely abandoned  Christianity, with less than 5 percent of the population  attending church on most Sundays. Thus many  Americans still can—or should—understand and even  appreciate the power of Islam for devout Muslims,  whereas western Europeans tend to find all traditional religious  belief irrational and out-of-date.

{"prompt":"","completion":" • What does the study of history have to tell us about the  future?  For centuries astrologers and scientists, experts and ordinary  people, have sought to peek into the future.

It helps put the  future in perspective. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Certainly, history is full of erroneous predictions, a few  of which we have mentioned in this book. Yet lack of success  has not diminished the age-old desire to look into the  future. Self-proclaimed experts even pretend that they  have created a new science of futurology. With great pomposity,  they often act as if their hunches and guesses about  future human development are inescapable realities. Yet  the study of history teaches healthy skepticism regarding  such predictions, however scientific and learned they may  appear. Past results suggest that most such predictions will  simply not come true, or at least not in the anticipated  ways. Thus history provides some psychological protection  from the visions of modern prognosticators. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" This protection is particularly valuable when we realize  that views of the future tend to swing between pessimistic  and optimistic extremes from one generation, or even  from one decade, to the next. These swings back and forth  between optimism and pessimism, which one historian  has aptly called “the great seesaw in the development of  the Western world, reflect above all the current situation  of the observers.7 Thus in the economic stagnation and  revived cold war of the 1970s and 1980s, many projections  into the future were quite pessimistic, just as they  were very optimistic in the 1950s and 1960s. Many  people in the Western world feared that conditions were  going to get worse rather than better. For example, there  were fears that pollution would destroy the environment  and that the traditional family would disappear. Some  gloomy experts predicted that twenty to thirty states  might well have nuclear weapons by the end of the twentieth  century. Many forecasters and politicians predicted "}

It was  heartening in that time of pessimism to know that most  dire predictions do not prove true, just as the same  knowledge of likely error is sobering in times of optimistic  expectations. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Optimistic visions of the future were certainly in the air  after the end of the cold war. The pendulum had definitely  swung, most notably in the United States. Untroubled  in the late 1990s by the high unemployment  and the early stages of corporate downsizing that soured  the mood in western Europe, the United States celebrated  its dynamic economy and its booming stock market.  U.S. military power, leadership in world affairs, and  excellence in advanced technologies also encouraged optimism  and rosy projections. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In 2000 the American mood shifted. The dot-com  bubble burst, and in 2001 the U.S. economy slid into a  recession. The al-Qaeda attack on New York and the  tragic war in Iraq, with its endless carnage and suicide  bombings, led to many pessimistic forecasts of a long uphill  struggle against global extremism, especially Islamic  extremism. Most frightening of all were grim warnings by  some self-described experts who predicted that terrorist  groups were likely to succeed in developing or buying biological  and nuclear weapons of mass destruction, which  they would then turn on millions of innocent people with  unspeakable cruelty. Such nightmare scenarios are not impossible,  but we should remember that modern governments  possess tremendous resources that they can  mobilize to control individuals and opposition groups, especially  when the leading states decide to work together,  as they did immediately after September 11, 2001.

{"prompt":"","completion":" by many as a moderate bridge-builder and denounced "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" by others as an Islamic militant in clever disguise. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Born in Switzerland of Egyptian ancestry, Ramadan  is the grandson of Hassan al-Banna, the charismatic  founder of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood. Al- Banna fought to reshape Arab nationalism within a  framework of Islamic religious orthodoxy and anti- British terrorism until he himself was assassinated in  1949. Growing up in Geneva, where his father sought  refuge in 1954 after Nasser’s anti-Islamic crackdown in  Egypt, the young Tariq attended mainstream public  schools, played soccer, and absorbed a wide-ranging  Islamic heritage. For example, growing up fluent in  French and Arabic, he learned English mainly from  listening to Pakistani Muslims discuss issues with his  father, who represented the Muslim Brotherhood and  its ideology in Europe. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Ramadan studied philosophy and French literature as  an undergraduate at the University of Geneva, and he  then earned a doctorate in Arabic and Islamic studies.  Marrying a Swiss woman who converted to Islam, Ramadan  moved his family to Cairo in 1991 to study Islamic  law and philosophy. It proved to be a pivotal  experience. Eagerly anticipating the return to his Muslim  roots, Ramadan gradually realized that only in Europe  did he feel truly “at home. In his personal experience  he found his message: that Western Muslims should feel  equally “at home and that they should participate fully  as active citizens in their adopted countries. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" In developing his message, Ramadan left the classroom  and focused on creating non-scholarly books,  audio cassettes that sell in the tens of thousands, and  media events. Slim and elegant in well-tailored suits  and open collars, Ramadan is a brilliant speaker. His  public lectures in French and English draw hundreds of  Muslims (and curious non-Muslims). "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Ramadan argues that Western Muslims basically  live in security, have fundamental legal rights, and can  freely practice their religion. He notes that Muslims in  the West are often more secure than are believers in the  Muslim world, where governments are frequently repressive  and arbitrary. According to Ramadan, Islamic  teaching requires Western Muslims to obey Western  laws, although in rare cases they may need to plead  “conscientious objection and disobey on religious "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" With growing fame has come growing controversy.  In 2004, preparing to take up a professorship in the  United States, he was denied an entry visa on the  grounds that he had contributed to a Palestinian charity  with ties to terrorists. Defenders disputed the facts  and charged that his criticism of Israeli policies and the  invasion of Iraq were the real reasons. Ramadan’s  critics also claim that he says different things to different  groups: hard-edged criticism of the West found on  tapes for Muslims belies the reasoned moderation of  his books. Some critics also argue that his recent condemnation  of Western capitalism and globalization is  an opportunistic attempt to win favor with European  leftists and does not reflect a self-proclaimed Islamic  passion for justice. Yet, on balance, Ramadan’s reputation  remains intact.† An innovative bridge-builder, he  symbolizes the growing importance of Europe’s Muslim  citizens. "}

As surely as anything is  sure, this process of change over time will continue as the  future becomes the present and then the past. And students  of history are better prepared to make sense of this  unfolding process because they have already observed it.  They know how change is rooted in existing historical  forces, and their projections will probably be better than  many of the trendy speculations of futurologists.

{"prompt":"","completion":" 1053  Chapter Summary "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" • In what ways did Solidarity confront the communist  system in Poland, and how did Mikhail Gorbachev try  to reverse the decline of communism in the Soviet  Union?  • How did anticommunist revolutions sweep through  eastern Europe in 1989, and what were the immediate  consequences?  • How, in the 1990s, did the different parts of a  reunifying Europe meet the challenges of  postcommunist reconstruction, resurgent nationalism,  and economic union?  • Why did the prospect of population decline, the  reality of large-scale immigration, and concern for  human rights emerge as critical issues in contemporary  Europe?  • How and why did relations between the West and the  Islamic world deteriorate dramatically in the early  twenty-first century?  • What does the study of history have to tell us about  the future?  The rise of Solidarity in Poland showed again that the  communist system in eastern Europe depended ultimately  on Soviet armies. Therefore, when the Russian  leader Mikhail Gorbachev refused to use force abroad  and his ambitious reforms at home spiraled out of control,  the peoples of eastern Europe rose and overturned  communist rule in the spectacular, peaceful revolutions  of 1989. In a dramatic finale, the democratic movement  triumphed in the Soviet Union, the two Germanies  joined in a single state, the cold war ended, and the  United States remained the only superpower. "}

Social and economic  reconstruction in Russia was less successful than it was in  eastern Europe, with the glaring exception of the former  Yugoslavia, which was destroyed by resurgent ethnic nationalism.

{"prompt":"","completion":" The twenty-first century highlighted critical issues,  and we have seen how the European baby bust, the  growth of illegal immigration, and the increased commitment  to human rights were all interrelated. The most  disturbed development was the renewed hostility between  the West and the Islamic world, which was marked  indelibly by the al-Qaeda attack of 2001, the campaign  to punish Afghanistan, and the American and British invasion  of Iraq. Essentially an effort to remake Iraq (and  the Arab world) along Western lines, the war in Iraq saw  American soldiers run up against a potent combination  of Arab nationalism, Islamic extremism, and sectarian  conflict. War in the Middle East encouraged shrill cries  about an ominous Muslim threat from immigrants living  in western Europe, but a study of history would suggest  that these fears were greatly exaggerated.

{"prompt":"","completion":" no pursuit and they had no interest in the boys. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" However, under the policies of the minister of "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" interior—the presidential candidate Nicolas  Sarkozy—there had been a general police crackdown  in these ugly suburban clusters of  deteriorating high-rise apartments built years ago  to house immigrant workers. They were meant to  be machines for living. The police attention meant  random identity checks, police suspicion, and  harassment of young men hanging about—maybe  dealing in drugs, maybe simply doing nothing  because there is nothing for them to do. (In the  past, they at least had to do national military  service, which was a strong integrative force, but  now France has a professional army.) "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Their grandfathers came to France, mostly from  North Africa, to do the hard labor in France’s  industrial reconstruction after the Second World  War. Their fathers saw the work gradually dry up  as Europe’s economies slowed, following the first  oil shock in the early 1970s. After that came  unemployment. The unemployment rate in the  zones where there has been the most violence is  nearly 40 percent and among young people it is  higher. Many of the young men in these places  have never been offered a job. When they applied,  their names often excluded them. "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Religion is important . . . in the French ghetto,  it provides the [shell] that protects against the  France that excludes Muslims. To the European  Muslim, it seems that all of the powerful in the  world are in collusion to exclude Muslims—or are  at war with them. The war in Iraq, on television,  is the constant backdrop to Muslim life in Europe.  There are itinerant imams who can put the young  ghetto Muslim on the road to danger and adventure  in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq—or elsewhere.  There are plenty more who preach a still  deeper ghettoization: a retreat inside Islamic fundamentalism,  totally shutting out a diabolized  secular world. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" One would think there would be a revolutionary  potential in these ghettos, vulnerability  to a mobilizing ideology. This seems not to  be so. We may be living in a religious age, but it  is not one of political ideology. In any case, it  is difficult to imagine how the marginalized,  thirteen- to twenty-three-year-old children of  the Muslim immigration could change France  other than by what they are doing, which is to  demonstrate that the French model of assimilating  immigrants as citizens, and not as members  of religious or ethnic groups, has failed for them.  It has failed because it has not seriously been  tried. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" The ghettoization of immigrant youth in  France is the consequence of negligence. It has  been as bad as the ghettoization through political  correctness of Muslims in Britain and the  Netherlands, where many people who thought of  themselves as enlightened said that assimilation  efforts were acts of cultural aggression. The  immigrant in France is told that he or she is a  citizen just like everyone else, with all the rights  and privileges of citizenship—including the right  to be unemployed. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Nicolas Sarkozy’s zero tolerance of crime and  of the petty mafias in the ghetto contributed to  touching off these riots, but until recently he was  the only French politician to say there has to be  affirmative action to get an immigrant elite out of  the ghettos and into important roles in French  life, where they can pull their communities after  them. Some affirmative action has been attempted  in recruiting candidates for the elite grandes écoles  [state schools] that train the French administrative  and political class, where the cultural hurdles are "}

{"prompt":"","completion":" The DBQ question looks like a standard free-response essay question. Following  the question is a series of documents, usually ten to twelve. The documents may be written  sources, pictures, artwork, maps, graphs, tables, or charts. Your task is to read and interpret  the documents and then to use them as evidence to answer the question in essay  format. Your essay will look like a regular essay (introduction, thesis statement, supporting  paragraphs, and conclusion).

Organization of documents into groups  First, it is essential that you directly answer the essay question\/prompt. While this  may seem obvious, many students struggle to understand the terms of the question. The  College Board uses the task words listed below in crafting essay questions.

You  may also group documents that appear to counter each other; this practice is called juxtaposition.  It is possible to create groupings using broad categories such as political,  economic, religious, social, intellectual, or artistic views.

Also, it is important to remember that it takes at least two documents used properly  as evidence to make one group. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" FORMULATE A THESIS that addresses the terms of the question. You are expected to  create an original and specific thesis, not simply a rewording of the question. The thesis  should serve as a road map for your essay, and it should demonstrate to the reader how  you plan to answer the question. Also, a strong introduction will preview the body paragraphs  of your essay by articulating the way you intend to group the documents and  organize the essay. "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" WHILE WRITING THE ESSAY it is important to create strong topic sentences that introduce  the groupings for each of your body paragraphs of the essay. Your analysis of the  documents as they relate to the terms of the question should be used as evidence to  support your thesis. Also, it is essential to refer to the documents INDIVIDUALLY  and SPECIFICALLY. This is best accomplished by students who afford proper ATTRIBUTION  to the documents. Each document contains source information; you should  use this source information when referring to the document—for example, According  to Protestant reformer Martin Luther, or A Catholic priest from Paris stated.

You seem to think so learned a woman has scarcely before  been seen in the world. You are wrong. . . . The explanation is clear: women have been able by nature to be  exceptional, but have chosen lesser goals. For some women are concerned with parting their hair correctly,  adorning themselves with lovely dresses . . . or standing at mirrors to smear their lovely faces. But those in  whom a deeper integrity yearns for virtue, restrain from the start their youthful souls, reflect on higher things,  harden the body with sobriety and trials, and curb their tongues, open their ears, compose their thoughts in  wakeful hours, their minds in contemplation to letters bonded to righteousness.

One cause of this barren blooming  I attribute to a false system of education, gathered from the books written on this subject by men who,  considering females rather as women than human creatures, have been more anxious to make them alluring  mistresses than affectionate wives and rational mothers; and the understanding of the sex has been so bubbled  by this specious homage, that the civilized women of the present century, with a few exceptions, are only  anxious to inspire love, when they ought to cherish a nobler ambition, and by their abilities and virtues exact  respect.
