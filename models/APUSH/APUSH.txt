xiv To the Student 
To the Student 
I hope you enjoy reading By the People and that you learn the value of the study of American history and historical thinking skills 
as a result of reading it. 
Th e title of this book— By the People —describes one of my key goals. Th is is a history of the many diff erent peoples who have 
shaped the United States as it is today. Whenever possible, I have focused on the stories of average everyday women and men 
who have created this country. In a survey of U.S. History it is essential to tell the stories of the leaders—the people from George 
Washington to Barack Obama and also from Benjamin Franklin to Andrew Carnegie to Jane Addams—who have had been the 
best known leaders of their generation. At the same time I believe it is equally important to tell the story of some of those whose 
names have been forgotten—women and men who fought in the Revolutionary army, enslaved people who ran away or found 
other ways to resist and ultimately gain freedom, women who worked for decades to win the right to vote, immigrants who came 
to the United States in the hope of building a better life, American Indians of many diff erent tribes who found ways to maintain 
their cultures in spite of formidable obstacles. Th ese and many other people are essential to the story that is told in this book. 
In focusing on the stories of the diverse peoples of this country I have also sought to foster a sense of agency—as well as historical 
knowledge. When history becomes one thing aft er another, it gets boring. When history becomes only a celebration of the 
good and greats among us, it is unbelievable. And when history is only a story of the bad things that some Americans have done 
to others, it is just plain depressing. On the other hand, if American history can be the story of those who fought back against 
injustice, who organized to win new rights, who found ways to build a better society, then our students can ask, “why not me?” 
And, I believe that such a history of people who made a diff erence in the past can lead today’s students in your time to join etc. the 
list of those who have helped build a better and more hopeful country. 
Please let me know what your experience is like. Email me at James W.Fraser@nyu.edu . I am anxious to hear and to learn.

On a North American continent controlled by American Indians, contact among the peoples 
of Europe, the Americas, and West Africa created a new world. Chapters 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 
Key Concept 1.1 
Before the arrival of Europeans, native populations in North America developed a wide 
variety of social, political, and economic structures based in part on interactions with the 
environment and each other. 
Chapter 1 
I. As settlers migrated and settled across the vast expanse of North America over time, they 
developed quite diff erent and increasingly complex societies by adapting to and transforming 
their diverse environments. 
pp. 1 – 16 
Key Concept 1.2 European overseas expansion resulted in the Columbian Exchange, a series of interactions and 
adaptations among societies across the Atlantic. Chapters 1 , 2 
I. The arrival of Europeans in the Western Hemisphere in the 15th and 16th centuries triggered 
extensive demographic and social changes on both sides of the Atlantic. pp. 17 – 23 , 29 – 38 
II. European expansion into the Western Hemisphere caused intense social/religious, political, and 
economic competition in Europe and the promotion of empire building. pp. 33 – 35 , 41 – 54 
Key Concept 1.3 Contacts among American Indians, Africans, and Europeans challenged the worldviews of 
each group. Chapters 2 , 3 , 4 
I. European overseas expansion and sustained contacts with Africans and American Indians 
dramatically altered European views of social, political, and economic relationships among and 
between white and nonwhite peoples. 
pp. 29 – 34 , 37 – 38 , 
78 – 89 , 92 – 104

autonomy in the face of European challenges to their independence and core beliefs. 
pp. 78 – 81 , 88 – 89 , 
97 – 104 
Period 2 
1607–1754 
Europeans and American Indians maneuvered and fought for dominance, control, and 
security in North America, and distinctive colonial and native societies emerged. Chapters 3 , 4 
Key Concept 2.1 Diff erences in imperial goals, cultures, and the North American environments that diff erent 
empires confronted led Europeans to develop diverse patterns of colonization. Chapters 3 , 4 
I. Seventeenth-century Spanish, French, Dutch, and British colonizers embraced diff erent 
social and economic goals, cultural assumptions, and folkways, resulting in varied models of 
colonization. 
pp. 63 – 75 , 83 – 90 , 
116 – 119 
II. The British–American system of slavery developed out of the economic, demographic, and 
geographic characteristics of the British-controlled regions of the New World. pp. 91 , 97 – 104 
III. Along with other factors, environmental and geographical variations, including climate and 
natural resources, contributed to regional diff erences in what would become the British 
colonies. 
pp. 66 – 71 , 73 – 77 
Key Concept 2.2 European colonization eff orts in North America stimulated intercultural contact and 
intensifi ed confl ict between the various groups of colonizers and native peoples. Chapters 3 , 4 
I. Competition over resources between European rivals led to confl ict within and between North

of autonomy. 
pp. 95 – 97 , 109 – 116 
Period 3 
1754–1800 
British imperial attempts to reassert control over its colonies and the colonial reaction

The Navajo people, or Dine as they prefer to be called, tell a story of 
their coming into this world. Th e story begins in a world of darkness 
( Nihodilhil): 
Because of the strife in the First World, First Man (Atse Hastin), 
First Woman (Atse Estsan), and the Coyote called First Angry, followed 
by all the others, climbed up from the World of Darkness 
and Dampness to the Second or Blue World. 
From this dark or black world the people emerged through the blue and 
yellow worlds before finally making their way to the bright white world 
where they live today: 
Th e Locust was the fi rst to reach the next world. He looked around, 
and saw that the world was covered with water that glittered and 
everything looked white. This is why they call it the Glittering 
World or White World (Nihalgai). 
Soon, First Man and First Woman began to make things the way 
they were supposed to be. Th e Holy People helped them. Th eir fi rst 
was to rebuild the mountains.…Th en, the people made a fi re. 
start it, they used fl int.…First Man and First Woman wanted a 
hogan.…Talking God helped to build the fi rst hogan.…Th is was the 
place where the people lived and worked. 
By now First Man and First Woman had become human. Th ey 
were like us. 
The World Before 1492 
Jacques Le Moyne, an early French explorer, recorded Native American women 
cultivating crops. Within the cultures of most North American tribes, women were, 
indeed, the prime cultivators of crops, while men hunted.

Aft er this, there were four seasons. In the spring, the plants came up from 
the ground. In the winter, the plants died and were hidden under the snow. 
Th en in the spring they came up again. Th e plants grew into crops like corn, 
beans, and squash. 
Source: Th ere are many versions of the Navajo creation story. Th is account was provided by Harry 
Benally a Navajo carver and silversmith from Sheep Springs, New Mexico, and Harold Carey, 
a Navajo historian from Malad City, Idaho. http://navajopeople.org/blog/navajo-creation-storynihalgai-

Other North American tribes had their own stories of how their people emerged 
onto the earth from a region below, or arrived through the water, or came down from 
the clouds. All believed that some ancient pilgrimage had brought them to the place 
where their tribe resided and would, with divine favor, reside forever. 
Modern anthropologists tend to trace the path of early human immigration from 
Asia either on foot across what was sometimes dry land between what is now Russian 
Siberia and Alaska or by small boats that hugged the coast of the two continents 
beginning some 25,000 or even 35,000 years ago. Hunters from Siberia may have followed 
their animal prey across solid land and then fanned out across the Americas. 
Seafaring travelers might have followed the fi sh from Alaska down the coast of North 
and South America. Perhaps both forms of migration took place. 
While the ancestors of modern American Indians were building their communities, 
establishing their culture, and engaging in extended trade with other Native 
Americans, other humans in other parts of the world were developing their own 
oft en quite diff erent cultures. Carvings found in southern France and North Africa 
date from the same period as the earliest settlements of the Americas. Although contact 
between the rest of the world and the Americas was at best minimal, the people 
who lived in Africa, Asia, and Europe maintained some level of contact with one 
another over thousands of years, even as they developed their own languages as well 
as agricultural and social systems. Th e arrival of Europeans in the Americas aft er 
1492 led to dramatic transformations of the cultures of all of these places. Peoples 
who had developed very diff erent cultural norms as well as diff erent ways of viewing 
the world suddenly came into contact with each other. Understanding the independent 
development of people and cultures on both sides of the Atlantic is essential to 
understanding how contact between them would signifi cantly change them all.

THE PEOPLING OF NORTH AMERICA 
Describe what the archeological record tells about the arrival, development, and cultures 
of the fi rst peoples of North America. 
While the Navajo told the stories of First Man and First Woman emerging aft er the long 
journey up through various worlds to fi nd themselves in the place where the tribe lived, 
other Native Americans had their own creation stories. To the residents of the Jemez Pueblo 
in northern New Mexico, Fotease (chief of the War society) planned a journey to come 
to this world to test the people’s power, and when they arrived at the site of their pueblo 
they knew they had found the right place saying, “Th is will be the place for us forever; from 
here we are not going to move the pueblo to any other place.” For the Shasta of what is now 
the Northwest United States, their world began when Old Man Above bored a hole through 
the sky and came down to Earth to plant the fi rst trees and to create birds and fi sh and 
all the animals, including the grizzly bear, and then continued to live in his tepee, Mount 
Shasta. In the Zuni story the sun was lonely, so he sent for the people who lived below the 
ground and invited them to come out and live in the sunlight and gave them corn. 
While storytellers in every tribe keep these creation stories alive, modern anthropologists 
have a diff erent explanation of the way the various tribes arrived in the places where 
they lived. During an ice age, more of the world’s water is stored in glaciers. As a result, 
the oceans are lower, sometimes much lower. Geological evidence indicates that between 
36,000 and 32,000 years ago and again between 25,000 and 14,000 years ago, substantial dry 
land existed between the northern tip of Asia in Siberia and North America (see Map 1-1 ). 
1.1 
MAP 1-1 The Earliest Americans. While there is great debate about just when the fi rst Americans 
migrated from Asia, there is strong evidence that ice made the trips possible. Since sea levels were much 
lower—because so much water was being held in glaciers—it was possible to walk from Siberia across what 
is now the Bering Sea into North America and then down through passage ways in the glaciers. It is also 
likely that migrants came by small boats down the Pacifi c coasts of North and South America. 
Polar view shows that glaciers blocked movement 
from Beringia (B) into North America (A) 20,000 
years ago. By 14,000 years ago (large map) melting 
had created an access corridor.

Th is land was wide enough for animals, including mammoths and the human hunters 
who followed them, to cross. But when the glaciers melted, oceans rose, and what 
anthropologists now refer to as the Bering Land Bridge disappeared under what 
is now the Bering Sea. Any further human migration had to be by boat, which would 
explain the rapid expansion of human communities from Alaska to the southern tip of 
South America. 
The Land Bridge, Clovis Culture, and Recent Discoveries 
Most anthropologists used to believe that the fi rst immigrants to the Americas were 
the Clovis people who might have come to North America around 13,000 years 
ago. Th e Clovis people took their name from a site near what is now Clovis, New 
Mexico, where a trove of 13,000-year-old arrow and spear points was found in 1929. 
The points, which were fluted so they could be attached to spears, were obvious 
signs of human activity and were the oldest human artifacts found in the Americas 
up to that time. 
Recent excavations in central Texas, however, found primitive spear tips that 
are at least 15,500 years old, much older and less sophisticated than those found at 
Clovis. Archaeologists have discovered similar evidence at many sites elsewhere in 
the Americas. Because no Clovis-like spear tips have ever been found in Siberia, most 
anthropologists now believe that the Clovis spear point was an invention that early 
Americans developed long aft er they had lost contact with Asia. 
Newer anthropological evidence also suggests that not all of the fi rst peoples of the 
Americas walked to get there. Other peoples may have crossed the oceans thousands 
of years before the fi rst Europeans ever set foot in the Western Hemisphere. Whenever 
and however the fi rst inhabitants of the Americas came, their descendants adapted 
to their new lands, spread out across the Americas, and created a wide range of languages 
and civilizations. By 14,000 years ago, various peoples were living in every part 
of North and South America.

Alaska and Siberia thousands of years ago,

Changing Climate and Cultures—Anasazi and Cahokia 
Before the arrival of Columbus, the largest and most sophisticated civilizations in the 
Americas were found in Mexico and South America. Nevertheless, hundreds of years 
before Columbus crossed the ocean, complex communities could be found in the 
present-day United States—among the ancient residents of Chaco Canyon in New 
Mexico, known as the Anasazi, and among the Cahokia people of the Mississippi 
River Valley. 
THE ANASAZI OF THE SOUTHWEST Th e Anasazi , or “ancient ones,” began building 
communities in New Mexico and Arizona perhaps 700 years before the arrival of 
Columbus. Th ey cultivated crops such as corn (or maize), beans, squash, and chilies 
that were needed to feed a settled, urbanized community. In time, the Anasazi began 
developing Chaco Canyon in northwest New Mexico as the hub of a widespread 
trade and ceremonial-religious network. Chaco Canyon was a large city built of logs 
and adobe (mud bricks) with buildings as high as fi ve stories. It included more than 
a dozen pueblos (large buildings) in an area measuring 8 miles by 2 miles. Facing the 
main plaza, with its underground kivas where religious rites were conducted, Pueblo 
Bonito contained 800 rooms and may have housed 2,000 people. It was the largest 
“apartment” building in North America until the 1880s. Roads from Chaco Canyon 
allowed trade to develop in many directions. Turquoise and other valuable goods 
were traded, perhaps as far south as central Mexico. 
After a prolonged drought in the early 1100s, the Anasazi abandoned Chaco 
Canyon. Their descendants created small farming communities across the 
Southwest. Some built the cliff dwellings that can still be seen at Mesa Verde in 
southwestern Colorado. While smaller than Chaco Canyon, Mesa Verde includes 
some 200 rooms. Built into the side of the canyon wall, the rooms off ered protection 
Anasazi 
Anasazi, meaning “ancient ones,” lived in 
modern day New Mexico, Arizona, and 
Colorado some 700 years before Columbus. 
Many American Indian tribes moved often, seeking 
better hunting or farming or to escape more belligerent 
neighbors. The Natchez tribe of Louisiana is related linguistically 
and culturally to the pyramid builders of Mexico and Guatemala. 
They tell a story of their movement north to Louisiana that fits 
with the archeological evidence of such a movement around the 
year 800. A Keeper, or priest, of the Natchez told the following 
story to a Frenchman in Louisiana in the 1700s. 
Before we came to this land we lived yonder under the sun 
[pointing with his finger nearly southwest, by which I understood 
that he meant Mexico]; we lived in a fine country where 
the earth is always pleasant; there our Suns [chiefs] had their 
abode, and our nation maintained itself for a long time against 
the ancients of the country, who conquered some of our villages 
in the plains but never could force us from the mountains. 
Our nation extended itself along the great water [the Gulf of 
Mexico] where this large river [the Mississippi] loses itself; but 
as our enemies were become very numerous, and very wicked, 
our Suns sent some of their subjects who lived near this river, to 
examine whether we could retire into the country through which 
it flowed. The country on the east side of the river being found 
extremely pleasant, the Great Sun, upon the return of those who 
had examined it, ordered all his subjects who lived in the plains, 
and who still defended themselves against the ancients of the 
country, to remove into this land, here to build a temple, and to 
preserve the eternal fire.

from enemies, since they could be reached only by ladders. By 1300, the Anasazi, 
faced with another great drought, also abandoned Mesa Verde and seem to have 
disappeared from history, though the founders of Acoma Pueblo may have been 
Anasazi. Acoma, not far from Albuquerque, New Mexico, was established some 
time in the 1100s. Still functioning today, it may be the oldest continuously inhabited 
city in the current United States. 
Other peoples, kn-own as the Hohokam settled on lands further west near 
present-day Phoenix, Arizona. While the Hohokam communities existed for hundreds 
of years, the high point of their civilization is estimated to have been between 
1150 and 1450. Th ey developed an extensive agricultural system using canals to 
irrigate crops that included cotton, tobacco, corn, beans, and squash. But like 
the Anasazi, they slowly declined. Ruins of Hohokam communities may be seen 
in Casa Grande, Arizona. Slowly Hopi, Zuni, Pueblo, and Navajo peoples moved 
into the older Anasazi and Hohokam territory of New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, and 
Colorado and built the pueblos and villages that the fi rst Spanish explorers encountered 
in the 1500s. 
CAHOKIA AND THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY The Cahokia people of the 
Mississippi Valley, also known as the Mound Builders , created a fl ourishing culture 
between 900 and 1350. If one could go back 1,000 years and visit Cahokia, the center 
of this culture, one would fi nd a city surrounded by strong wooden walls with 
thatch-covered houses that were home to 20,000 to 40,000 people, near what is 
now East St. Louis, Illinois. Cahokia was probably the largest settlement in what is 
now the United States, and 1,000 years ago, its “Mississippian culture” fl ourished 
throughout the Mississippi Valley and beyond. Archaeologists have found similar 
mound-building communities at Coosa and Etowah, Georgia; Moundville, Alabama; 
and Natchez, Mississippi. 
Mound Builders 
A name given to Native American tribes 
that built large burial and ceremonial 
mounds on which religious and sports 
activities took place. 
The Anasazi built housing or palaces into the cliff s to provide protection from the weather and from other 
tribes who might try to attack.

Closer Look Cahokia 
Aztec artists created this drawing of the 
cultivation of corn before the arrival of the fi rst 
Europeans. 
At the center of Cahokia, a series of wide earth mounds up to 100 feet high led 
to the people being called the Mound Builders. Th ese mounds were used to bury the 
most prominent leaders. Atop the central mound was a temple and a wide plaza used 
for ceremonies centered on the seasons and the sun. Th e plaza was located on a perfect 
north-south axis, and a massive circle of wooden posts functioned as a kind of observatory 
to trace the sun’s path. 
Priests and chiefs at Cahokia tracked the sun, conducted rituals, and dispensed 
gifts that displayed their power, while nearby hamlets grew the food that 
fed the city’s inhabitants. Such large, settled communities were possible because 
agricultural practices had replaced the earlier hunting and gathering economy 
and made a differentiated society possible. By about 900, a warming trend in the 
earth’s climate had made new forms of agriculture possible. Instead of being limited 
to what they could find or hunt to eat, residents of Cahokia were thus able to 
begin farming. Like the Hohokam of the Southwest, they cultivated squash, corn, 
and beans, which they could grow on a seasonal basis, store as a surplus through 
the winter, and thereby support an urbanized culture. When eaten together, 
maize and beans form a complete protein, and as a result, the population could 
be well nourished. 
In Cahokia, and in most settled Native American cultures, farming was women’s 
work. Men hunted to add animal protein and fl avor to the diet. Together, they 
produced a rich supply of food, enough to sustain not only themselves but a much 
larger community that included many—priests, chiefs, and the workers who built the 
mounds—who neither farmed nor hunted.

THE DIVERSE COMMUNITIES OF THE AMERICAS IN THE 1400s 
Describe the diversity of American Indian cultures in the United States on the eve of their 
encounter with Europeans. 
Th e native peoples of North America were a remarkably diverse group. * Th ey spoke many 
diff erent languages, some more diff erent from each other than English is from Chinese. 
Th ese languages were spread among 500 to 600 independent societies with diff erent 
approaches to hunting and farming, diff erent social structures, varying creation stories, and 
diverse understandings of the spiritual (see Map 1-2 ). Nevertheless, Native American tribes 
1.2 
* Th ere is considerable debate today about the terms American Indian and Native American . In fact, most of 
the descendants of the fi rst peoples of North America prefer to be identifi ed by their specifi c tribe—Navajo or 
Mohawk or Cherokee or whatever specifi c group—when possible. When speaking of larger groups of native 
peoples, some think that Native American is a more respectful term while many others prefer to be called 
American Indian or Indian. In Mexico most prefer “indigenous” while many Canadian tribes prefer “fi rst 
nations.” In keeping with that diversity of preferences, this book uses tribal names when relevant and otherwise 
uses the terms American Indian or Indian and Native American interchangeably. 

10 Part I Contact and Exploration, 1491–1607 
also tended to share some things in common. Th ey tended to live comfortably with nature 
and in harmony with the sacred, which they found in every aspect of life. Th ey saw time as 
circular—not a steady line from creation to the present and future, but a reoccurring series 
of events to be celebrated in rituals that involved the retelling of ancient stories linked to the 
annual growth of the crops and to animal life. Th ey honored shamans and priests who were 
considered visionaries and who were expected to have contact with the supernatural and 
keep the stories alive. Th ese shamans and priests had the special responsibility of helping 
restore harmony when it was disrupted by disease, war, or climactic changes that brought 
famine. Most native North Americans saw the community and not the individual as the 
focus of life and labor. Community members won fame and respect by what they gave 
away more than by what they kept for themselves. Th e accumulative spirit of autonomous 
Europeans, gaining ever more possessions—especially land and the status in European 
society that came from land ownership—made no sense to most American Indians. 
Although precise measurement is impossible, scholars estimate that 
approximately 7 million Indians lived in what is now the United States and Canada 
with much larger numbers in Mexico and Central and South America. Th e total 
population for all of the Americas was probably 50 to 70 million, perhaps as high 
as 100 million, when the fi rst Europeans arrived. Europe’s population at the time 
was approximately 70 to 90 million, and Africa’s population was 50 to 70 million. 
If these numbers are correct, then although North America was relatively sparsely 
populated, the Americas as a whole had as many or more people than either Europe 
or Africa in 1492. Asia, it is worth noting, had a far larger population, perhaps in 
the range of 200 to 300 million people. 
North American Indians also lived in a land of extraordinary physical diversity, from 
the tundra of Alaska to the forests of New England, from the prairies and grasslands of 
the Midwest to the lush Pacifi c Coast and the dry Southwest. In these diverse environments, 
climatic changes led to seasons of plenty and seasons of famine. Diff erent environments 
also led to radically diff erent ways of life. While the settled farmers of Cahokia and 
their descendants in the southeast and the pueblo peoples of the southwest left the clearest 
records, many nomadic tribes roamed the heart of the continent and the Pacifi c coast, 
depending much more on their skills as hunters and their ability to gather abundant plant 
foods than on settled agriculture. Success and failure in war or the spread of disease caused 
American Indian populations to ebb and fl ow long before the fi rst European encounters. 
The Pueblo People of the Southwest 
Some of the largest American Indian settlements in what is now the United States were 
in the Southwest. In place of the abandoned Anasazi centers, Pueblo and Hopi people 
created thriving settlements in New Mexico and Arizona. Taos Pueblo in northern 
New Mexico, with its multistoried buildings for many families, is still inhabited as are 
many other Pueblo and Hopi communities in the region. 
In the Pueblo and Hopi Southwest, an intricate maze of canals, dams, and terracing 
allowed agriculture to fl ourish in a dry climate. Like the Anasazi, the Pueblo and Hopi 
diet relied on corn, brown beans, and various forms of squash. Th ey had domesticated 
turkeys and used dogs to hunt, so wild game, in addition to turkey, added animal protein 
to their diet. 
In both Hopi and Pueblo communities, members of special societies wore ritual 
masks called kachinas and danced in ceremonies designed to connect the community 
with its ancestors while seeking their presence and blessing on the crops. Th e Pueblo 
people eventually spread out over Arizona and New Mexico, speaking diff erent languages 
yet connected to each other by trade and common religious practices. 
The Tribes of the Mississippi Valley 
In the mid-1300s, Cahokia and the mound-building culture began to disappear. No 
one knows all of the reasons for this decline, but climate almost certainly had a role 
1.3 
1.2 
1.1 
1.4 
1.5 

Chapter 1 The World Before 1492 11 
in it. Around 1350, a relatively rapid colder climate shift known as the “Little Ice Age” 
began and lasted until 1800. As the climate got colder, agriculture suff ered. Europeans 
abandoned their settlements in places like Greenland. If the power of its priests and 
kings in Cahokia depended on their seeming control of the sun and the seasons, the 
Little Ice Age sapped that power. Th e change in weather drastically reduced the supply 
of food from outlying hamlets on which their large cities depended. Whatever all the 
reasons, by 1400, Cahokia was abandoned. 
With the decline of Cahokia and the mound-building culture, the population of 
the Mississippi Valley shrank. Th e most direct descendants of Cahokia, the people 
later known as the Creeks, Choctaws, and Chickasaws, settled on the eastern side of 
the Mississippi River and the southern Appalachian Mountains. 
Other tribes dominated other parts of Cahokia’s former territory. Th e Cherokees and 
Tuscaroras settled in parts of Georgia, Tennessee, and North Carolina. Th ey are connected 
linguistically with the Iroquois of the Great Lakes and New York more than with 
the Creeks and Choctaws. Yet other tribes dominated the Piedmont of what would be the 
Carolinas. Whatever their language or background, most of these tribes lived in small 
communities of 500 to 2,000 people. None lived in cities that were anything like Cahokia. 
Neighboring villages might exchange corn or meat. Longer-distance exchange—and 
there was considerable long-distance exchange—was generally limited to things that were 
rare and easy to carry: copper implements, beads and shells from the Atlantic Coast, or 
quartz from the Rocky Mountains. Artifacts uncovered in almost any native settlement 
in North America attest to the lively trade among all of the continent’s tribes. 
Archeological evidence also suggests that as Cahokia declined, smaller chiefdoms 
developed and oft en fought with each other and with other tribes. Th ese communities, 
sometimes only a few families, built places of refuge throughout the Mississippi Valley. 
Mississippian villages in the 1400s included a half dozen to several dozen houses 
with a central fi eld for games or ceremonies, all surrounded by a wooden wall that, if 
not strong enough to keep out a determined enemy, at least assured against surprise 
attacks. Several families oft en shared a single structure. Structures that housed a chief ’s 
family were somewhat larger but do not seem to have refl ected a grander lifestyle. As 
weather and war made food scarcer—it was harder to cultivate crops and more dangerous 
to hunt game if human enemies were lurking nearby. Th e possibility of starvation 
increased. Still, the fi rst European explorers who arrived in the 1540s reported 
fi nding large settlements in modern South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, and Tennessee 
with rich well-tended fi elds and well-designed houses and villages. 
The Pacifi c Coast—From the Shasta to the California Indians 
In the Pacifi c Northwest, the Shasta and other tribes lived in towns of several hundred 
people, constructing houses as long as 60 feet built of cedar and richly decorated with 
painting and sculpture. Th ese Pacifi c Coast Indians lived primarily on the abundant 
salmon in their rivers, which could be smoked or dried for year-round consumption. 
As a result of plentiful food and good housing, these tribes developed a settled community 
life with their own art and culture. 
Farther down the Pacifi c Coast in California, the Yokut, Miwok, Maidu, and Pomo 
represented one of the largest concentrations of American Indians north of Mexico, 
perhaps 700,000 or 10 percent of the Indians north of the Rio Grande. Th ese Native 
Americans lived in clans of extended families rather than larger tribal units. Th eir 
economy was based on gathering wild plants and on fi shing and hunting. Th ey did 
not engage in settled agriculture probably because the wild foods in California were so 
abundant and settled agriculture off ered little improvement in their diet or way of life.

an alliance and a united front against other tribes, an approach that would also serve 
them well in their encounters with Europeans. Th e Iroquois Confederacy’s central meeting 
place and council fi re was near present-day Syracuse, New York. In Iroquois communities, 
several families would live in a single sturdy longhouse made of posts and 
poles covered with bark, but the house itself and the land around it belonged to the 
community. As many as 1,000 people lived in some Iroquois towns made up of many 
longhouses. Iroquois legends tell of a great peace-maker, Dekanawidah, who convinced 
the warring tribes to live together under the Great Law of Peace. An eclipse of the sun 
around the year 1142 supposedly strengthened his plea for unity. Clans led by women 
governed the five nations. The women leaders chose the sachems, male leaders who 
attended the council meetings and led in war but who were also accountable to the clans. 
On the Atlantic Coast and the eastern slopes of the Appalachians were Algonquianspeaking 
tribes, the largest of which, the Powhatans, may have included 60,000 or more 
people. For these tribes—some of the fi rst to encounter Europeans—hunting and fi shing 
as well as farming corn, beans, and squash provided the major food sources. Th ey lived in 
permanent towns and villages. Like other tribes, the Atlantic Coast Indians did not keep 
written records but even as late as the 1670s an English trader described an Indian town of 
many houses along crisscrossing streets, surrounded by a stockade 2-feet thick and 12-feet 
high. Social life centered in the ceremonies of the seasons that gave thanks for the gift s of 
food, especially the green corn dance held in late summer, which might attract several 
hundred Indians from surrounding villages, to give thanks for the harvest and to celebrate 
the start of a new year. Although the description came from the early 1600s, there is no 
reason to assume that Algonquian community life had changed much since the 1400s. 
The Aztec, Mayan, and Inca Empires 
Traveling south from the current United States in the mid-1400s, one came to the great 
Aztec city of Tenochtitlán. With a population of 200,000, it was as large as or larger 
than any contemporary city in Africa or Europe. Th e Aztecs founded Tenochtitlán

I n 1585, the English adventurer Sir Walter Raleigh founded 
the short-lived colony of Roanoke on the coast of what is now 
North Carolina. Richard Hakluyt—who never left England—used 
stories of Raleigh’s experiences in North America to create a “true 
picture” of the American Indians. Since the Indians themselves 
did not keep such records, Hakluyt’s account provides some of the 
best examples of what Native American life was like at the time of 
their first contacts with Europeans.

The Princes of Virginia…wear the hair of their heads long.… 
They wear a chain about their necks of pearls or beads of copper, 
which they much esteem, and they wear bracelets of the same 
material on their arms.…They carry a quiver made of small 
rushes holding their bow ready bent in one hand, and an arrow 
in the other, ready to defend themselves. In this manner they go 
to war, or to their solemn feasts and banquets. They take much 
pleasure in hunting deer whereof there is great store in the 
country, for it is fruitful, pleasant, and full of good woods.…The 
women…are of reasonably good proportion. In their going they 
carry their hands dangling down and wear a deer skin excellently 
well dressed, hanging down from their navel unto the middle of 
their thighs, which also cover their hinder parts. The rest of their 
bodies are all bare.… 
At a certain time of the year they make a great, and solemn feast 
whereunto their neighbors of the towns adjoining repair from all 
parts, every man attired in the most strange fashion.…Then being 
set in order they dance, sing, and use the strangest gestures.…All 
this is done after the sun is set for avoiding of the heat…. 
The towns of this country…are compassed about with 
poles stuck fast in the ground, but they are not very strong. The 
entrance is very narrow. There are but few houses therein, save 
those which belong to the king and his nobles. 
This people therefore void of all covetousness live cheerfully 
and at their hearts ease. But they solemnize their feasts in the 
night, and therefore they keep very great fires to avoid darkness 
and to testify their joy.

on an island in the middle of Lake Texcoco in 1325, connected it to the mainland by 
three broad causeways, and supplied the city with fresh drinking water through a carefully 
designed aqueduct. When the Aztecs fi rst arrived in central Mexico, the people 
who then ruled the region, known as the Toltecs, looked down on them as barbarians. 
Th at soon changed. Th e Aztecs conquered the Toltecs and destroyed their capital. 
Th e Aztec’s Tenochtitlán used Toltec designs, but was a new and grander capital. Led 
by their emperor, Aztec society was highly stratifi ed; the emperor and priests at the top 
ruled a powerful empire with a population of 10 to 20 million that dominated subjugated 
tribes in surrounding areas. 
Th e huge markets of Tenochtitlán in which 40,000 or 50,000 traders 
met to exchange gold and jewelry, pottery and baskets, meat, fi sh, fruit, 
and vegetables amazed the fi rst Spaniards who described it as “thrice as 
large as the celebrated square in Salamanca [in Spain].” Th e Aztecs maintained 
an extensive trade network with other peoples but also made war 
on them to expand their empire and ensure a steady stream of prisoners 
for the human sacrifi ces they believed their gods demanded. While the 
Aztecs built their empire by making strategic alliances with other tribes, 
by the mid-1400s, they relied on their own large army and attacked former 
allies, creating enemies who would help the Spanish conquer the Aztecs in 
the early 1500s. 
To the east and southeast of the Aztec Empire was the once great 
empire of the Maya. The Mayan Empire had been at its height long 
before the Aztecs emerged on the scene. Indeed, the Mayan culture had 
been developing for thousands of years when they fi rst came into contact 
with Europeans. Th e high point of Mayan culture, known as the classical 
period, entered a period of decline hundreds of years before the rise of the 
Aztecs, probably due to an extended period of drought and overfarming 
of the land. 
Th e Mayans dominated what is now the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico 
and much of modern Honduras, Belize, and Guatemala. Th e Mayans were 
the only American culture to develop a fully functional written language. 
Th ey also developed sophisticated systems of mathematics and a calendar 
that projected time far into the future. Like the Aztecs, they practiced human 
sacrifi ce and subjugated other nearby tribes in pursuit of people and goods. 
Th ey had an extensive agricultural system producing not only food but also 
cotton, which was a source of trade and wealth. 
While in decline, the Mayans, some 800,000 people divided into 16 to 
18 independent kingdoms, were still a strong presence in western Mexico 
and Central America in the 1400s. Th e remains of their greatest architecture 
could be seen all around them. Th ey still produced and traded cotton, 
and their trade routes connected them with the other empires of 
the Americas. 
Further south, the Inca Empire was even larger than that of the 
Aztecs. It extended along the Pacifi c coast of South America from southern 
Colombia to northern Chile, and included almost all of what is today 
Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia (see Map 1-3 ). Th e Incas ruled some 32 million 
people from their capital of Cuzco, another city of 200,000, in what is 
now Peru, and from the mountain fortress and religious center of Machu 
Picchu. Th e empire had a vast bureaucracy and army as well as 25,000 miles 
of roads and bridges rivaling those of ancient Rome, all supported by heavy 
taxes. Incan religion was centered on the sun and its seasons; human and animal sacrifi 
ce was common. Th e Inca emperor and his family were considered divine. Like the 
Aztecs, the Inca Empire was relatively new when Europeans encountered it in the early 
1500s. Th e main Inca conquests had occurred only in the 1400s.

Chapter 1 The World Before 1492 15 
American Indian Cultures, Trade, and Initial Encounters 
with Europeans 
While the peoples living in North and South America before 1492 were divided by signifi 
cant language diff erences and great distances, they still knew quite a bit about each 
other and traded regularly with far distant communities. Trade networks stretched from 
the Aztec Empire across all parts of North America. Th e presence of sea shells in Native 
American communities a thousand miles from the ocean and copper implements hundreds 
of miles from the nearest copper mine attests to the trade in goods that was rich 
and varied by the 1400s (see Map 1-4 ). 
Not all exchanges between tribes were friendly. Th ere was certainly warfare also, 
sometimes to settle matters of honor and sometimes in the search for valuables. 
Hunting peoples seem to have raided farming communities, and farming communities 
fought with each other from time to time if one was thought to encroach on another’s 
land. Bows and arrows were deadly weapons, and scalping an enemy to gain a trophy, 
and perhaps a part of the enemy’s spirit, were well known before 1492. 
Even though the native peoples of North and South America maintained their trade 
networks and fought with other tribes, each tribe saw itself as the center of its own world. 
Th eir diff erent stories and cultures refl ected that, although trade might be of value, trading 
partners were not seen as part of their community. To understand Indian responses to the 
arrival of the Europeans, it is essential fi rst to understand that no Indians thought of themselves 
as being American Indians or Native Americans as opposed to white Europeans. 
Instead, they thought of themselves as Senecas or Creeks or Hopi or some other discrete 
population. Th is mindset prevented any unifi ed resistance to the fi rst European aggressions 
in the 1400s and, later, in the 1500s and even 1600s. If a particular tribe thought it 
made sense to ally with the Europeans against another tribe, or trade with the Europeans 
for new goods that would give them an advantage over another tribe, they saw no reason 
not to do so. If the Europeans could become part of well-established trade networks 
or allies in attacking long-standing enemies, so much the better. It took several hundred

years before most American Indians realized that the Europeans did not look on them as 
they looked on themselves and that any equality in trade or warfare was to be short lived. 
While different tribes were happy to make alliances with different groups of 
Europeans, Native American culture tended to understand warfare in ways radically 
diff erent from most Europeans. War among tribes was usually a way to settle specifi c 
issues or achieve honor and, most of all, to restore the balance that was essential to 
Indian life. Th e European model of total conquest was a concept that would have been 
foreign to most American Indian cultures. In this way as in so many other ways, the 
Europeans who began arriving in the 1490s could not have been more diff erent. 
At the same time, and unknown to the people of the Americas, other peoples, living 
in Europe, Africa, and Asia were developing their own societies, creation stories, and 
world views. Th e world was never the same once representatives from these diverse 
peoples—Spanish explorers, slaves and free servants from West Africa, and those who 
followed them across the Atlantic—met and mingled with the native peoples of the 
Americas. But to understand the mingling, one must understand the development of 
separate cultures in other parts of the world. 
A CHANGING EUROPE IN THE 1400s 
Describe the changes in Europe that led to Columbus’s voyages and that shaped European 
attitudes when encountering the peoples of the Americas. 
Europeans had been sailing on the Atlantic long before Columbus was born. Norse sailors, 
commonly known as Vikings, came from modern-day Norway and Denmark and settled 
Iceland in the late 800s. In 980, they expanded their territory to Greenland where they 
interacted—not always peacefully—with the local Inuit people and exported lumber to 
Scandinavia while maintaining themselves with successful farms. In 1001, a Norse party 
led by Leif Erickson established a colony further west that they named Vineland. No one is 
sure where Vineland was, though tradition places it in North America. Modern excavations 
show the remains of a Norse colony in the modern Canadian province of Newfoundland. 
Some claim Norse settlements as far south as the modern state of Maine. But while Iceland 
maintained contact with Europe and the Greenland colony survived until the early 1400s 
when the same colder weather that undermined Cahokia also brought the Greenland colony 
to an end, Vineland was never permanent, and by the time Columbus was born, all 
earlier European contact with North America was long forgotten. In the hundred years 
before Columbus sailed across the Atlantic, Europe went through a series of extraordinary 
changes. Th ose changes not only set Columbus on his travels but shaped the beliefs and 
expectations with which the fi rst Europeans arrived in the Americas. 
If a time-traveler were to go back to the Europe of the 1400s—to London, England, 
or Seville, Spain, or Paris, France, or the rural countryside where most people lived— 
they would fi nd a world that would seem strange and primitive. Th ere were not a lot 
of people around. Europe was still recovering from the devastating Black Death , the 
bubonic plague that arrived in 1348 on rats carried by ships trading in the Black Sea. 
In a few years aft er it fi rst arrived, the plague wiped out at least one-third, perhaps 
even one-half, of Europe’s population. About 70 million people lived in Europe in 
1300. By the late 1350s, the plague had reduced the population to perhaps 45 million. 
Whole families and villages disappeared. Th rough the late 1300s, there were empty 
fi elds or forests where people had once lived or farmed. Th e loss of so many people 
traumatized the survivors who looked for someone to blame for the disaster. Jews, 
religious nonconformists, and foreigners made good scapegoats, and there were massive 
persecutions across Europe.

A unifi ed Roman Catholic Christian Church dominated the religious life of Europe 
in the 1400s. Th e Protestant Reformation was still a century in the future. Distance 
between cities, the diffi culty of travel, and political divisions resulted in a Catholic 
Church that was far less centralized than it is today. Nevertheless, the church with 
its liturgy, creeds, and clergy—the pope, bishops, priests, monks, and nuns—was the 
strongest institution in Europe, unifying people who had diff erent languages and leaders. 
Literacy, learning, and the preservation of culture rested mostly with the church. 
Th e church also provided what social services there were for the aged, sick, and poor. 
Jews lived in most parts of Europe, sometimes tolerated, sometimes savagely repressed, 
occasionally honored for their contributions to medicine, commerce, and scholarship, 
but they were a small minority. In the cities a great cathedral was the largest building, 
and everywhere church spires marked the center of both secular and religious life. 
Life to modern eyes would seem primitive. Most people were dirty, poorly clothed, 
and illiterate. Life expectancy was in the 30s, especially because infant mortality and 
deaths from childbirth were high. Trade was limited because transporting most things was 
diffi cult and expensive. Th e church taught that seeking wealth, especially charging interest 
for loans, was sinful. People were encouraged to stay where they were—in the community 
and in social class where they were born, whether they were peasants or nobles. 
The Ottoman Empire Changes Eastern Europe 
In 1453, when Christopher Columbus was 2 years old, Muslim Ottoman Turks conquered 
the city of Constantinople, the most important city in Eastern Europe. From 
their new capital, renamed Istanbul, the Ottomans ruled an empire that stretched from 
Hungary to include the Balkans and most of the Middle East and North Africa. Th e 
Ottoman Empire controlled the eastern Mediterranean for the next 4 centuries. 
Th e fall of Constantinople shocked Europe. Constantinople had been at the crossroads 
of the trade routes between Europe and Asia and was considered the equivalent 
of Rome as a religious and political center. Th e Ottomans encouraged trade within 
their empire, but restricted others from using the land and sea routes across the eastern 
Mediterranean. Suddenly Christian Europe was cut off from the lucrative land-based 
trade in spices and luxury goods with Asia that had existed since Italy’s Marco Polo 
had traveled to China in the late 1200s. Th e Mediterranean, which had been the great 
unifying conduit of the Roman Empire, was now as divided as the lands surrounding 
it. Th e city states of Italy—Venice, Genoa, and Florence especially—which had dominated 
the Mediterranean and trade with Asia and grown wealthy from it, began a slow 
decline. Other Europeans on the Atlantic Coast, especially those in Portugal and Spain, 
began to seek new ways to reach Asia—without the need to deal with the Ottomans. 
The Rise of Portuguese Exploration 
Th e fi rst and in many ways most adventurous European to seek a new way of connecting 
with Asia was Prince Henry of Portugal (1394–1460). Even before the Ottoman 
conquest of Constantinople, Henry, a younger son of the King of Portugal, decided 
that Portugal, with its strategic location on Europe’s southern Atlantic Coast, should 
try to establish a new trade route to Asia by sailing around Africa. 
Although he is known to history as “the Navigator,” Henry’s personal seagoing was 
modest. In 1415, he commanded a Portuguese fl eet, but for the rest of his life, he stayed 
at his castle at Sagres on the Portuguese coast and commissioned others to make voyages 
and report back to him. Th ese voyages generated not only geographical information 
about the African coast, but they also led to better navigational instruments and charts as 
well as better-designed ships that could travel greater distances in bad weather and good. 
In 1424, Prince Henry organized a long series of expeditions—in which others did 
the actual travel—that sailed farther and farther south along the coast of Africa. Once 
they learned how to navigate the currents off the African coast, Portuguese explorers 
moved quickly. In 1444, Portuguese ships reached Senegal, long fabled as a source of

In the 1400s, the vast majority of the people of 
Europe were poor peasants who worked long days 
in the fi elds with little economic gain to show for 
their work. At the top of society were nobles who 
lived in grand castles, like the one pictured, and 
the clergy who reminded nobles and peasants of 
their responsibility to stay in the class to which 
they were born and not seek economic or social 
advancement.

gold, and established a slave-trading company in Lagos. Th ey reached Sierra Leone 
around 1460 as well as claimed and settled the previously uninhabited Cape Verde 
Islands. Finally, in 1488, Bartolomeu Dias rounded the Cape of Good Hope on the 
southern tip of Africa. A decade later, in 1498, Vasco da Gama followed Dias’s route 
and reached India. Th ese successful expeditions led to fl ourishing trade with Asia and 
Africa by the early 1500s. Th e Portuguese not only established a string of trading colonies 
in India, Indonesia, and China, they also developed a massive new African trade. 
Portuguese merchants virtually reinvented slavery in Western Europe, and Portugal 
became the fi rst and most signifi cant player in the African slave trade as well as in the 
spice trade with Asia. By 1504 at least one ship a month sailed from Lisbon to Asia, 
and the wealth from Asian spices and other luxury goods and from African gold and 
slaves was making Portugal the richest nation in Europe. 
Historians have argued about Henry’s, and by extension Portugal’s, motives. 
Henry certainly wanted to fi nd a route that would put Portugal at the center of the 
trade with Asia. Asian goods—porcelain, silk, spices—had long been popular and 
profi table luxury goods in Europe. Th e nation that could secure access to these goods 
aft er the Ottomans restricted the eastern Mediterranean routes would become rich. 
Old animosity between Christian Europe and the Muslim world fueled the quest to 
defy Ottoman trade obstacles. Legends of a Christian presence in the heart of Africa 
also motivated expanded contact with that continent. If the Christians of Europe 
could ally with Christians who might be in Africa, their armies would surround the 
Muslim world and weaken its power. Perhaps most important to Henry, however, 
was the wealth to be made in Africa itself. Portugal could obtain African gold and 
slaves from every voyage whether or not it made discoveries or alliances with far-off 
Christians. 
Slavery was an ancient institution. It was sanctioned in the Bible and other ancient 
texts thousands of years before the days of Prince Henry. The Roman Empire had 
slaves, including some from Africa. But while slavery had died out in most of Europe 
during the Middle Ages—although serfs in Russia were only semi-free—it persisted in 
the Middle East and Africa. Arab traders brought African slaves across the Sahara to 
sell in markets in the Middle East. In fact, various African peoples routinely captured 
and enslaved their rivals. And Muslim conquerors and pirates enslaved captured 
European Christians. Europeans developed new forms of slavery along with the exploration 
of Africa. As early as 1336, King Alfonso IV of Portugal reported, and probably 
sponsored, slave raiding in the Canary Islands off the coast of West Africa. Indeed, the 
Canary Islands would be an important base for further exploration of Africa, one oft en 
contested between Portugal and Spain. Aft er 1500, slavery would transform European 
commerce, most of all in the trade with European colonies in the Americas, while also 
transforming and weakening the economies of Africa, and—in particular—utterly 
changing the lives of millions of Africans. 
England and France 
While Portugal was establishing its ocean routes to Asia and growing fabulously 
wealthy in the process, most of the rest of Europe remained poor and distracted with 
more immediate worries. France and England fought the Hundred Years’ War (1337– 
1453) with each other, depleting both nations’ resources. When the war ended, France 
was divided by a bitter civil war until 1477 as the royal government sought to assert its 
control of the kingdom. England was also torn by a civil war, the War of the Roses, as 
the Lancaster and York branches of the royal family fought until Henry VII defeated 
Richard III of York in 1485. Th e destruction wrought by war and plague left little time, 
money, or energy for either France or England to engage in exploration. 
Despite all their troubles, England and France were relatively unifi ed kingdoms. In 
contrast, other areas of Europe were not united at all during this period and, in fact, 
would not be until the mid-1800s. For centuries before its unifi cation, most of what 
Prince Henry, a younger son of the king of 
Portugal, sponsored new developments in ship 
building and navigation and ordered a series of 
voyages that allowed Portuguese sailors to explore 
the west coast of Africa and eventually, after 
Henry’s death, to sail around the continent and on 
to India where they developed lucrative trade.

is now Germany was considered part of the Holy Roman Empire but the empire was 
actually a very loose confederation divided into a number of much smaller entities. 
No even nominally unifi ed Italian state existed. Until the 1800s, what is now modern 
Italy was divided into many competing, independent free cities, principalities, and 
small kingdoms that spoke diff erent and oft en mutually incomprehensible versions of 
Italian. Th ese groups were also oft en at war with each other. As a result, these areas 
did not initiate much organized external exploration. Even though many sailors from 
what is now Italy were among the most important European explorers of the era, they 
worked for other governments. 
The Unifi cation and Rise of Spain 
Unlike some other parts of Europe, Spain, however, achieved a dramatic new 
unity in the late 1400s, and this unified Spain would be a powerful force in the 
Americas. The political, cultural, and religious unification of Spain—known as 
the Reconquista , or “reconquest”—was an extraordinary development given the 
7 centuries during which unity of any sort had seemed impossible. In 711, Muslim 
invaders from North Africa conquered most of the Iberian Peninsula (modern Spain 
and Portugal) and remained in control of parts of it for almost 800 years. While the 
rest of Europe remained Christian, much of Medieval Spain was in African Muslim 
(Moorish) hands. 
Christian monarchs gradually reconquered Portugal and most of Spain from the 
Muslims, but the struggle took centuries. While some areas were ruled by Christians, 
many others remained Muslim. Yet the very divisions of Spain resulted in some of the 
richest cultural developments in Europe. While armies fought, people mingled, producing 
new ideas and some of the scientifi c developments that would later enrich all 
of Europe. It was through Spain that the culture of Islam came into Europe, including 
Arabic numerals, algebra, paper, cotton, rice, and sugar. It was in Muslim Córdoba 
that Greek philosophy, Roman law, and eastern art and architecture mixed. It was 
also in Spain, far more than elsewhere in Europe, that Jews were treated with respect, 
even honor, as “peoples of the book” who shared sacred scriptures with Christians and 
Muslims. It was also on the border lands between Christianity and Islam that some of 
the great medieval cities of Spain—León, Zamora, Burgos, and Ávila—emerged, creating 
an independent class of citizens who were neither nobles nor serfs but free women 
and men. As the medieval saying went, “the air of the city makes you free.” 
Spain’s long-standing divisions ended in the late 1400s. By 1400, the Iberian 
Peninsula was divided into four Christian kingdoms—Castile, Aragon, Portugal, 
and Navarre—and one Muslim kingdom in the south—Granada. In 1469, Isabella 
of Castile married Ferdinand of Aragon. Th is marriage united the two most powerful 
Spanish thrones. Th e joint monarchs then began a long campaign to fi nish the 
reconquest of Spain. In January 1492, their armies defeated Muslim Granada, adding 
its territory to their kingdom and ending the 800-year long Islamic presence in 
Spain. Th at same year, in the name of religious uniformity, Ferdinand and Isabella 
expelled all Jews from Spain, a move that cost them some of their most innovative 
citizens. But Isabella and Ferdinand wanted their nation to be unifi ed, and like most 
Europeans at the time, they saw religious uniformity as key to that goal. And in 
that same eventful year, Isabella commissioned an Italian sailor named Christopher 
Columbus to try to fi nd a route to Asia that would be diff erent from the African one 
Portugal was exploring.

AFRICA IN THE 1400s 
Describe the political, cultural, and religious developments in Africa that would shape 
contact between Europeans and Africans in the Americas. 
In the late 1400s, parts of Africa were also undergoing changes that would infl uence the 
cultural interactions that would take place in the “New World” in the 1500s. Just as in 
Europe and the Americas, none of the people in Africa knew that they were living on 
the edge of events that would turn their world upside down. Yet events were underway 
that would change the lives, economies, cultures, and worldviews of almost everyone. 
Ancient Ties Between Africa and Europe 
Contact between Africa and Europe did not begin with Prince Henry’s voyages. North 
Africa had been part of Mediterranean civilization for at least 3,000 years. What are 
today the nations of Egypt, Libya, Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia were some of the richest 
provinces of the Roman Empire. As Christianity spread throughout the Roman Empire, 
some of the strongest Christian centers were in North Africa. One of the most infl uential 
of all early Christian thinkers was St. Augustine (354–430), born in what is now Algeria, 
who served as bishop of the Algerian city of Hippo. Farther south, Christianity took root 
quickly in Ethiopia, and that part of east Africa has remained predominantly Christian 
for 2,000 years. In addition, southern Europe and parts of Africa south of the Sahara 
Desert shared a long history of trade (see Map 1-5 ). Th is trade was never entirely interrupted, 
even when Arab armies conquered North Africa in the 600s and Islam replaced 
Christianity as the dominant religion there. 
The Empires of Ghana, Mali, and Songhay 
Coastal areas of Africa south of the Sahara that the Portuguese encountered in 
the mid-1400s diff ered in customs, ethnicity, and economic life from Muslim 
North Africa. As these coastal Africans met Portuguese traders, they quickly 
took an interest in particular European goods, including iron and cloth, acquiring 
them through exchanges of hides, copper, ivory, and slaves. Trade produced 
a greater variety of goods on both continents and, for the African elite, added 
the prestige of owning goods from far away. Th e Africa that fi rst began major 
economic and cultural contact with Europe in those years was a continent that 
met its northern neighbor on terms of equality in military, cultural, and technological 
terms, its population not yet decimated by the massive trade in slaves 
that was to come or by attacks by industrialized European colonial forces. 
Just south of the Sahara, the kingdom of Ghana governed much of West 
Africa for hundreds of years. Ghana’s power was based on trade and its mastery 
of metalworking to make weapons and tools. Ghana was at the northern 
end of African trade routes that brought gold, ivory, and slaves out of 
the African interior and at the southern end of the desert routes by which 
Muslim traders brought the slaves, gold, and ivory from south of the Sahara 
to North Africa, the Middle East, and Europe in exchange for salt, silk, and 
other goods. Control of that trade made Ghana rich. Royal and religious offi - 
cials, soldiers, merchants, and iron workers dominated Ghana. 
As early as 1050, King Barmandana of Mali began to extend his kingdom, 
and the empire of Mali slowly dominated and replaced Ghana as the leading 
power in the region. Barmandana converted to Islam and made a pilgrimage 
to Mecca, the Muslim holy city in Arabia. Some 200 years later, another Malian 
king, Sundiata, made Mali the master of West Africa. When one of Sundiata’s successors, 
Mansa Musa, made his pilgrimage to Mecca in 1324, his lavish caravan and generous 
gift s spread gold so freely that “the value of Cairo’s currency was depressed for many 
years.” Mansa Musa built new mosques and schools and established an Islamic university 
at Timbuktu that was respected throughout the Muslim world for its scholarship.

Chapter 1 The World Before 1492 21 
To the east of Mali, another empire, Songhay, grew stronger, capturing Timbuktu in 
1458 just as the Portuguese were exploring the African coast. In the late 1400s, under two 
of its greatest kings, Sunni Ali (r. 1464–1492)—who died in the year of Columbus’s fi rst 
voyage—and Askia Muhammad (r. 1493–1528), Songhay became the strongest military 
and economic power in West Africa. When Sunni Ali became king of Songhay in 1464, he 
quickly established himself as an eff ective military leader. Sunni Ali also understood the 
religious divisions of his lands. Th e urban inhabitants, who controlled trade, were mostly 
Muslim. But in the countryside, most people held to traditional beliefs, and they were 
the source of the agricultural wealth of the kingdom. Th ough himself a Muslim, Sunni 
Ali treated both groups with respect and brought stability and prosperity to his kingdom. 
When Sunni Ali died in 1492, his son and heir, Sunni Baru, rejected Islam but was 
overthrown, and a new leader, Askia Muhammad (r. 1493–1528), came to power. Askia 
Muhammad was a devout Muslim, but like Sunni Ali, he respected traditional customs. 
As with Mali and Ghana, Songhay’s power was based on trade. Gold, ivory, and slaves 
could be collected from the south and east. In exchange, silks and other fi ne goods were 
brought in caravans across the Sahara from Egypt, the Middle East, and Europe. Trade 
created wealth, which allowed both lavish lifestyles and military power that extended 
the empires. And trade also facilitated the exchange of ideas and scientifi c information. 
Askia Muhammad’s control was such that he was able to make his own pilgrimage to 
Mecca in 1494–1497, trusting subordinates to maintain his rule in his absence. 
Kongo, Benin, and Central Africa 
South of Songhay, in the kingdoms of Kongo, Benin, and surrounding areas, government 
was powerful but far less structured than in the empires of Mali and Songhay. 
In the 1490s, Portuguese missionaries converted the king of Kongo to Catholicism. 
Close ties developed between Kongo and the papacy in Rome despite the enormous 
distances between them. More than a century later, slaves from Kongo would confuse 
English and Spanish authorities who did not expect their Christian beliefs and knowledge 
of the Catholic Mass. 
This mosque in Djenne, Mali, was originally built in the 1300s of mud hardened by the sun and was restored 
in the early 1900s to look much as it did at the height of the Mali Empire.

While Kongo kings were Catholic, most other Central Africans practiced traditional 
religions that included belief in a world aft er death, ancestor worship, and a 
central role for priests and other intermediaries between divine and human aff airs. 
Th e Africans who were taken across the Atlantic to the Americas as slaves brought 
these religious and cultural traditions with them. 
Kongo kings generally inherited the throne from their father or brother, but a group 
of nobles or electors could choose a different ruler. A similar system was found in 
much of Central Africa. In Ndongo, election ratifi ed succession within a reigning family. 
In Biguba, in what is now Guinea-Bissau, the king was elected from among a group 
of elite families. In Sierra Leone, the ruler was elected, but once in offi ce could dismiss 
the electors, and a similar system was followed in Benin. Europeans reported that, to 
maintain their own power, nobles sometimes deliberately selected weak monarchs. In 
1601, one European wrote, “a village mayor in our country has more authority than 
such a king.” In these West African kingdoms, a person or family could cultivate land 
secure in the knowledge that they would truly “own” the crops or goods produced on 
the land and could sell or trade them, but they could never sell the land itself. Indeed, 
if the family stopped working the land, any claim they might have to it disappeared. 
Centralized government and the wealth generated by trade also led to military 
power that allowed West Africans to resist not only the fi rst Portuguese attempts at 
conquest but also many subsequent ones. In 1446 when Portuguese explorers, seeking 
slaves and gold, reached the Senegal River (which is now the northern border of the 
country of Senegal), African canoes attacked their ship, and nearly all of the European 
raiders were killed. A year later the same thing happened to another crew near the 
island of Goree. Similar types of resistance would continue for the next 2 centuries. 
African boats were small compared to European ships. Th ey tended to be canoes dug 
out of a single log, but their small size gave them power. Th ey could navigate shallow 
areas where the Europeans could not go and could move quickly between rivers, estuaries, 
and the ocean. Th ese canoes carried as many as 50 to 100 fi ghters each. Facing such 
eff ective resistance at sea, before they ever landed on unknown shores or attempted to 
travel up uncharted and hostile rivers, the earliest Portuguese travelers quickly decided 
that it was better to seek peaceful trade agreements with African kings than to do battle. 
Th e result was that as early as 1456, Diogo Gomes represented the Portuguese crown in 
negotiating treaties of peace and commerce with African rulers of several states. 
Slavery in Africa 
Slavery was a signifi cant part of the African economy in the 1400s. It was important in the 
empires of Mali and Songhay and in Kongo long before the Portuguese arrived. In an economic 
system where the community, not an individual, owned land in common, as it did 
in West Africa, owning people who could work the land was a way to accumulate wealth. 
When the Portuguese began their African trade in the 1400s, African slaves had been 
brought across the Sahara to Europe and the Middle East for over 1,000 years. Benin City 
had seen slaves parade through for centuries. Th e Portuguese simply shift ed part of this 
trade to Europeans on the coast and away from the Arab-dominated overland routes 
across the Sahara. Although the voracious demand for enslaved Africans in the Americas 
would disrupt the African economy in the 1600s and 1700s, that was a later story. When 
the Portuguese fi rst became involved in the slave trade they merely built on existing trade 
and cultural traditions. Far fewer people were involved than would be the case in the 
future, but for those who were enslaved the new patterns created huge dislocations. 
An African could be enslaved for many reasons—as punishment for crime or as 
payment for debt—but most slaves were captured in war from other communities. 
Th ose who sold them considered the slaves aliens, not people like themselves. Like the 
American Indians, Africans did not think of themselves as Africans but as members of a 
specifi c tribe—Ashanti, Yoruba, Kru—and enslaving members of another tribe did not 
distress them. Th e economic advantages of capturing slaves in war and then selling them 
also made war itself a profi table commercial venture and exacerbated other tensions.

Nevertheless, just because slavery and the slave trade were already part of the economic 
systems of West Africa when the Portuguese arrived in the mid-1400s does not 
change the horror of the institution. Being captured in war, losing one’s freedom, and 
then being sent away from home must always have been terrifying. It was even worse if 
one was forced to march across the terrible Sahara Desert or loaded onto a ship controlled 
by strange-looking people who spoke a totally diff erent language and who considered 
slaves not merely aliens but subhuman. Although the earliest African and European slave 
traders did not recognize it—or probably care about it—a more terrible form of slavery 
was being born in the 1400s. For the fi rst time, not only the slaves’ freedom but also their 
language, culture, and identity were being destroyed. Th e Africans unlucky enough to 
become American slaves already knew about slavery as an institution, but they had never 
encountered conditions in which they were stripped of everything familiar to them. 
Africans, as slaves or as free people hired for the work, would accompany some of 
the earliest Portuguese, Spanish, and English explorers of North and South America 
in the 1500s, helping explore Florida, Virginia, Texas, and New Mexico. Descendants 
of Europeans and Africans have lived together with American Indians in the land that 
would be the United States for 500 years. 
ASIA IN THE 1400s 
Contrast developments in Asia with those in Europe at the time when Europeans first 
reached the Americas. 
While the Americas, Africa, and Europe were all divided into many small tribes, cities, 
and nation-states in the 1400s, China was united in a single empire and had been for 
more than 2,000 years. When Columbus sailed from Spain to the Americas in 1492, 
Europe had some 500 independent states. A single emperor governed perhaps 150 to 
200 million people in China. Of course, China is not all of Asia. Th e Indian subcontinent 
included 75 to 150 million people living in many independent principalities. 
Korea and Japan were independent kingdoms, while Tibet and Vietnam struggled to 
maintain their independence from China. But Asia was much more unifi ed than elsewhere, 
and most of the peoples of Asia were in contact with one another and enriched 
each one another’s cultures. 
In 1421, the Chinese Emperor Zhu Di celebrated the completion of the Forbidden 
City, his new palace and temple complex in Beijing. Envoys from as far away as East 
Africa and Arabia were present. Twenty-six thousand guests feasted at a 10-course 
banquet. In the same month, England’s King Henry V celebrated his wedding to a 
French princess with 600 guests. Zhu Di’s army included 1 million soldiers armed 
with gunpowder while Henry had 5,000 soldiers armed with bows and arrows. But 
then, Zhu Di’s new capital of Beijing had a population that was 50 times larger than 
Henry’s London. 
Zhu Di (r. 1402–1424) also commissioned Chinese fl eets that sailed to South Asia, 
India, and East Africa. Th ese treasure fl eets mapped the Indian Ocean and brought 
back exotic animals, trade goods, and knowledge that made China a center of geographic 
studies in the early 1400s. 
But Chinese oceanic exploration came at high cost. Huge forests in China and 
Vietnam were cleared to provide the teak to build the fl eets’ ships. Th ousands of artisans 
labored to build the ships, and many more left as sailors, most of whom never returned. 
Th e expensive ocean voyages also distracted China’s attention from its vulnerable land 
frontiers in the northwest. And the mandarins, China’s professional, highly educated 
bureaucrats, despised and resented the naval offi cers who were in charge of the fl eets.

In 1424, a new emperor, Zhu Gaozhi, issued an edict: 
All voyages of the treasure ships are to be stopped.…Th ose offi cials who 
are currently abroad on business are ordered back to the capital immediately.…
The building and repair of all treasure ships is to be stopped 
immediately. 
For the next 200 years, China became increasingly isolated from the rest of the 
non-Asian world. As a result, China played no role in the initial creation of the 
new world that came into being as people of the Americas, Europe, and Africa 
interacted. 
By the 1490s, China was prospering but quite inward looking. South Asia, especially 
India, was just beginning to be engaged in what would be a growing trade with 
Europe through the new trade routes that Portuguese explorers were establishing. 
Sub-Saharan Africa, dominated by the Songhay Empire and the kingdom of Kongo, 
was also trading with Europeans via a newly established Atlantic trade route dominated 
by the Portuguese, as well as their long-established trade routes across the 
Sahara that connected them with the Muslim world, increasingly dominated by the 
Ottoman Empire. American Indians had their own long-distance trade relationships 
that spanned thousands of miles, even though they never contemplated trade 
that might cross the oceans that bounded them. As all of this interaction was taking 
place, the newly united kingdom of Spain took the lead in seeking yet another way to 
expand trade in the world that they knew. At the beginning of the year 1492, no one 
living anywhere on the planet knew how eventful that eff ort to seek new pathways for 
trade would be. 
CONCLUSION 
The world that existed before the encounter that took place in 1492 was rich and 
dynamic in cultures, civilizations, and diversity. Th e fi rst peoples of North America 
had discovered and settled the continent long before Columbus set sail in 1492. Th e 
ancestors of today’s American Indians began to people North American during the 
Ice Age, when land routes existed between Siberia and Alaska. Whether they came by 
land or water, these original groups of people established agrarian and hunter–gatherer 
cultures over the centuries, and usually lived in remarkable harmony with their 
environment. Th is respect for harmony was a feature of their religions and worldview 
that, in so many ways, would be diff erent from the European mindset. Later North 
American Indian cultures established sophisticated trading empires and founded cities 
that rivaled those of medieval Europe. Th eir cultural heritage would be lost or changed 
forever by the impact of European arrival and colonization. 
While the fi rst peoples of North America had been establishing their communities, 
Europeans in the 1400s were on the move, recovering from the wars and the bubonic 
plague that had decimated the continent in the late 1300s. European contact with 
North America was motivated in part by the 1452 Muslim conquest of Constantinople, 
which placed the Eastern Mediterranean under the control of the Ottoman Empire 
and closed off traditional land and sea routes to India and other centers of trade in 
Asia. Th e kingdom of Portugal led the way in exploring sailing routes around Africa. 
Eventually, new trade relationships gradually developed between Europeans and the 
many preexisting African empires and kingdoms that had also developed sophisticated 
cultures and agricultural economies. Th e Portuguese adopted and exploited the institution 
of slavery and the slave trade, which had generally disappeared in Europe, and 
brought African slaves back to Europe even before the fi rst slaves were transported to 
the Americas.

Chapter 1 The World Before 1492 25 
Over a quarter century before Portugal’s Prince Henry the Navigator dispatched 
his sailors to explore the African coast, the Chinese emperor Zhu Di ordered the construction 
of the “treasure fl eets,” which explored and established trade routes in the 
Indian and Pacifi c oceans. His ships and sailors matched those of Europe; however, 
Zhu Di’s successor ordered the end of the treasure fl eets, which were seen as a drain 
on China’s wealth. For this reason, Europeans had no serious rivals when they fi rst 
encountered the Americas. 
While Portuguese sailors sailed around Africa to reach Asia, an Italian sailor, 
Christopher Columbus, was commissioned by the king and queen of Spain to try a different 
route, sailing west across the Atlantic rather than south and east around Africa. 
Th e result was an encounter between civilizations in Europe, Africa, and the Americas 
that knew nothing of each other—a world-changing event for everyone involved.

THE PEOPLING OF NORTH AMERICA 
Describe what the archeological record tells about the arrival, 
development, and cultures of the fi rst peoples of North America. 
Summary 
Most anthropologists believe the native inhabitants of the 
Americas walked on dry land between Siberia and Alaska during 
ice ages that created a land bridge between the continents or came 
by water in small canoes that stayed close to the coasts of both continents. 
Until recently, scholars believed that the fi rst immigrants 
to the Americas were the so-called Clovis people who might have 
come to North America approximately 13,000 years ago. New 
evidence, however, suggests that humans arrived much earlier. 
Whenever and however the fi rst Americans came, their descendants 
adapted to their new lands, spread out across the Americas, 
and created a wide range of languages and civilizations. Th e largest 
and most sophisticated pre-Columbian civilizations emerged in 
Mexico and South America. Nonetheless, complex societies also 
developed in North America, perhaps most notably the Anasazi 
of the Southwest and the Cahokia of the Mississippi River Valley.

independent societies. The diversity of the Native American 
population refl ected the physical diversity of the Americas; the

Chapter 1 Summary and Review 
Aztecs built an increasingly aggressive empire in central Mexico. 
Th e Incas built an even larger empire along the Pacifi c coast of 
South America. A vast bureaucracy and army, along with a welldeveloped 
infrastructure, helped the Incas maintain control of 
their territory. In what is now the U.S. Southwest, the Pueblo 
and Hopi peoples used sophisticated agricultural techniques to 
farm in a dry climate. A slightly smaller yet sophisticated culture 
of Mound-Builders established Cahokia, which flourished for 
centuries, but aft er its demise, the population of the Mississippi 
Valley shrank, and a number of small, village-based societies 
emerged. Th e inhabitants of the Pacifi c Northwest, including the 
Shasta, took advantage of an abundant food supply to develop a 
settled community life with well-developed art and culture. In 
the Northeast, the fi ve nations of the Iroquois—the Mohawks, 
Oneidas, Onondagas, Cayugas, and Senecas—formed a powerful 
confederacy. On the Atlantic Coast and the eastern slopes of the 
Appalachians, many tribes lived in permanent towns and villages. 
Hunting, fi shing, and farming provided the major food sources 
for these peoples. For all of the differences among American 
Indian communities, the extensive trade networks between them 
encouraged common ways of looking at the world.

set Columbus on his travels but shaped the beliefs and expectations 
with which the fi rst Europeans arrived in the Americas. 
In 1400, Europe was still recovering from the devastation of the 
Black Death. Th e Catholic Church was the most unifying force in 
Europe. From a modern point of view, life in this period would 
seem primitive. Most people were dirty, poorly clothed, and illiterate. 
Europe’s limited trade was further disrupted by the fall of 
Constantinople, a key trading hub, to the Ottomans in 1453. Th is 
event prompted Europeans to seek new ways to reach Asia for 
more direct trading opportunities. Prince Henry the Navigator 
spearheaded Portugal’s eff orts in this regard. During the 1400s, 
Portuguese explorers sailed around Africa and into the Indian 
Ocean. Internal divisions and conflicts left England, France, 
Germany, and Italy ill-equipped to follow Portugal’s lead. The 
completion of the Reconquista and the unifi cation of Spain under 
Isabella and Ferdinand, however, enabled Spain to emulate, and 
eventually surpass, Portugal’s accomplishments.

Preparing to Write: Summarizing the Facts 
To construct an effective argument about specific historical

in which those developments occurred. With this need for

yourself what information about Europe in 1400 a reader would 
need to understand subsequent events. 
AFRICA IN THE 1400s 
Describe the political, cultural, and religious developments 
in Africa that would shape contact between Europeans and 
Africans in the Americas. 
Summary 
By the 1400s, North Africa had been part of Mediterranean civilization 
for at least 3,000 years. In addition, parts of Africa south 
of the Sahara Desert had a long history of trade with southern 
Europe. In West Africa, Ghana’s power, which enabled it to gain 
control of much of West Africa, was based on trade and its mastery 
of metalworking to make iron weapons and tools. Ghana’s 
successors, Mali and Songhay, built similar regional empires, 
each, like Ghana, drawing its power from trade and technological 
advantages. In all three kingdoms, Islam was a religion of the 
cities and the ruling class. South of Songhay, in the kingdom 
of Kongo and surrounding areas, government was powerful 
1.4 
but far less structured. Centralized government and the wealth 
generated by trade also led to military power that allowed West 
Africans to resist not only the fi rst Portuguese attempts at conquest 
but also many subsequent ones. Slavery was a signifi cant 
part of the African economy long before the Portuguese arrived. 
But during the 1400s, a more terrible form of slavery was born 
through which not only a slave’s freedom but also his or her language, 
culture, and identity were destroyed.

Preparing to Write: Organizing Evidence 
Imagine you were preparing to write an essay on conditions in 
Africa on the eve of European westward expansion. List the most 
important events and developments described in this to include 
in such an essay. Write a sentence or two for each item explaining 
why you think the event or development in question is critical to 
our understanding of Africa at this turning point in its history. 
ASIA IN THE 1400s 
Contrast developments in Asia with those in Europe at the time 
when Europeans fi rst reached the Americas. 
Summary 
While the Americas, Africa, and Europe were all divided into 
many small tribes, cities, and nation-states in the 1400s, much 
of the heart of Asia was united under Chinese imperial control. 
In the 1400s, Chinese wealth, cities, technological sophistication, 
military power, and population dwarfed those of Europe. 
While the Chinese launched signifi cant exploration initiatives, 
such voyages were quickly halted, and China turned inward. 
For the next 200 years, China became increasingly isolated 
from the rest of the non-Asian world.

Chapter 1 The World Before 1492 27 

After 66 days of sailing, the last half on uncharted open seas, an 
Italian sailor commissioned by Queen Isabella of Spain, Christopher 
Columbus, and his crew landed on a small Caribbean island on 
October 12, 1492. Columbus named the island San Salvador. No one is sure 
on which island in the Bahamas Columbus fi rst landed. But there was a Taino 
village on the shore, and human contact came quickly. Columbus and his 
crew received a friendly greeting from the Tainos of whom Columbus said, 
I recognized that they were people who would be better freed [from 
error] and converted to our Holy Faith by love than by force—to 
some of them I gave red caps, and glass beads…and many other 
things of small value, in which they took so much pleasure and 
became so much our friends that it was a marvel. Later they came 
swimming to the ships’ launches where we were and brought us 
parrots and cotton thread in balls and javelins….In sum, they took 
everything and gave of what they had very willingly….All of them 
go around as naked as their mothers bore them… 
Th e world was never the same again. 
Although Columbus did not know it, that encounter represented 
the beginning of an extraordinary change in worldwide human contact. 
Columbus claimed that he had achieved his mission to reach Asia. The 
Europeans who came aft er him quickly learned that they had encountered 
Many of the islands on which Columbus landed, including the Bahamas, Hispaniola, and 
Cuba, were inhabitated by Taino Indians, the fi rst people in the Americas to interact with 
Columbus. This is a recreation of a Taino village in modern-day Cuba.

not Asia, but an unknown continent filled with people they had never imagined 
existed. The Columbian encounter led to unimagined power and wealth for many 
Europeans. It also led to the creation of new ethnic groups as children were born to 
American Indian-European couples. And it shifted the balance of trade and commerce 
around the world from land to the world’s oceans. 
For the American Indians, the encounter was even more of a surprise, and much 
more devastating. Suddenly, from across the ocean, unimagined people arrived, with a 
strange way of talking and dressing, a strange religion, and a diff erent way of looking 
at the world. In part because of diff erences in technology, in part because of diff erences 
between European and indigenous people’s understandings of war and conquest, and 
most of all, because of diff erences in the two groups’ ability to withstand European 
diseases, the encounter led to conquest, disease, and death for many Indians. 
Understanding what happened in the history of the United States over the next 
500 years depends on understanding the diff erences between those who arrived from 
Europe—especially from Spain, France, and England—as well as from Africa and 
the diverse peoples who lived in the Americas when they arrived. With the arrival 
of Columbus and the many Europeans who followed him once news of his journey 
spread, something new in human history took place: a massive transit and mixing of 
peoples in North and South America. 
COLUMBUS, THE COLUMBIAN EXCHANGE, AND EARLY CONQUESTS 
Explain the reasons behind the voyages of Columbus and early Spanish encounters with 
the peoples of the Caribbean, Mexico, and South America. 
As delighted as Columbus was by the Taino welcome and generosity and what seemed 
to him the easy opportunity to convert them to Christianity, Columbus also noted 
other things that would be more ominous for their future: 
Th ey do not carry arms nor are they acquainted with them, because I showed 
them swords and they took them by the edge and through ignorance cut 
themselves. Th ey have no iron. Th eir javelins are shaft s without iron and some 
of them have at the end a fi sh tooth. 
Conquest, Columbus came to believe, would be easy.

Columbus described what would be the terms of much of the European contact 
with American Indians: “Th ey should be good and intelligent servants, for I see that 
they say very quickly everything that is said to them.” Columbus also looked closely 
at the ornaments and jewelry that some of the Indians were wearing and wrote, “I was 
attentive and labored to fi nd out if there was any gold.” Th e search for gold, and the 
eff ort to subjugate the Indians in its service, had begun. 
The Four Voyages of Christopher Columbus 
In spite of the friendly welcome he received, Columbus took some Tainos as captives. 
He wanted to teach them Spanish and show them to his sponsors in Spain. Columbus 
also wanted guides to the gold he was sure could be found since he had seen some 
Tainos wearing gold ornaments. Led by native guides, he sailed on to Cuba and sent a 
party inland to fi nd the local chief (or cacique as the Taino called their leaders) who 
his guides said had access to gold. When Columbus did not fi nd the leader or the gold, 
he sailed to another island he named Hispaniola (modern Haiti and the Dominican 
Republic). He built a fort and left part of his crew there with instructions to search for 
gold. In January 1493, Columbus, with six Taino prisoners, turned back to Spain. 
Columbus never fully understood the importance of his voyage. He set out to 
discover a route across the Atlantic directly to Asia, and he thought he had indeed 
reached an unknown part of Asia, perhaps Japan or Korea. Th inking the people he 
met looked like those who came from the part of south Asia Europeans called “the 
Indies,” he called them Indians . Of course, he did not really discover a new land 
because the Indians were already there. Columbus certainly discovered a new route 
across the Atlantic, but it led to a continent fi lled with people unknown to Europeans. 
The rest of Columbus’s life was a tragedy, for himself and for the peoples he 
had encountered. To impress the Spanish court, Columbus exaggerated what he had

R eturning from his first voyage in early 1493, Columbus understood 
how much his exploration was linked to Ferdinand 
and Isabella’s efforts to unify Spain into a militant, single-minded 
nation. He spelled out these links when he dedicated his report 
to the rulers. 
Whereas, Most Christian and Very Noble and Very Excellent 
and Very Powerful Princes, King and Queen of the Spain’s and of 
the Islands of the Sea, our Lords: This present year of 1492, after 
your Highnesses had brought to an end the war with the Moors 
who ruled in Europe and had concluded the war in the very great 
city of Granada, where this present year on the second day of the 
month of January I saw the Royal Standards of Your Highnesses 
placed by force of arms on the towers of the Alhambra…and 
Your Highnesses, as Catholic Christians and Princes, lovers and 
promoters of the Holy Christian Faith, and enemies of the false 
doctrine of Mahomet and of all idolatries and heresies, you 
thought of sending me, Christóbal Colón, to the said regions 
of India to see the said princes and the peoples and the lands, 
and the characteristics of the lands and of everything, and to see 
how their conversion to our Holy Faith might be undertaken.… 
So, after having expelled all the Jews from all of your Kingdoms 
and Dominions, in the same month of January Your Highnesses 
commanded me to go, with a suitable fleet, to the said regions 
of India.

found, especially the gold. Isabella and Ferdinand gave him seventeen ships and 
1,200 men for a second voyage to seek slaves and gold in this supposed part of Asia, 
just as the Portuguese were fi nding both in Africa. 
When he arrived back on Hispaniola in 1494, Columbus found that the native residents 
had killed the sailors he had left behind in 1492. A local chief initially off ered 
protection to the Europeans, but when the sailors sought to make the Tainos slaves, 
they rebelled. Columbus ordered retribution, and many Tainos were killed. As word 
spread of the harsh ways of the Europeans, the Indians became less friendly, and 
Columbus found himself “discovering” deserted villages. The Caribbean had little 
gold despite Columbus’s desperate eff orts to force the natives to fi nd it, and many 
Tainos died from Spanish swords or from forced labor that the Spanish instituted. 
Columbus himself was a better explorer than administrator and less vicious than 
many of his successors (see Map 2-1 ). During his third voyage to the Caribbean in 
1498, he tried to set up a government on Hispaniola. But many Spaniards complained 
about hard lives there with little reward. A new governor sent Columbus back to Spain 
in chains. Although the Spanish monarchs forgave him and allowed him a fourth voyage 
in 1502, he never governed again. 
Amerigo Vespucci Inspires a Continent’s Name 
Columbus was not the fi rst European to reach the Americas. Archeologists have discovered 
evidence of a short-lived Norse settlement called L’Anse aux Meadows on Newfoundland 
somewhere between 900 and 1000, but the settlement was quickly forgotten on both sides 
of the Atlantic. If others crossed the Atlantic, or the Pacifi c, their voyages were also soon 
forgotten. What was diff erent about the voyage of Columbus was that so much of Europe 
took interest and so many Europeans followed in his wake. 
In the earliest exploration and conquest of the Americas, Spain was the unquestioned 
leader. Portugal focused primarily on its rich trade routes around Africa and

into the Indian Ocean. However, Portuguese explorers also quickly followed routes 
across the Atlantic similar to those of Columbus, exploring, and claiming much of 
South America. In 1494, Spain and Portugal agreed to the Treaty of Tordesillas in 
which a line drawn by the pope separated Spanish and Portuguese claims in South 
America. To this day, Brazil, east of the line, is a Portuguese speaking country while 
the rest of South America is Spanish speaking. 
In April 1495, only two years after Columbus returned from his first voyage, 
Isabella and Ferdinand authorized other Spanish voyages across the Atlantic. A young 
Italian merchant, Amerigo Vespucci, made three or four trips—the historical record 
is not clear—between 1497 and 1504, some authorized by Spain, others by Portugal. 
Sailing along the coast of Brazil, much farther south than Columbus ever ventured, 
Vespucci concluded that the land mass on the other side of the Atlantic was much 
larger than the fi rst reports indicated. Unlike Columbus, Vespucci was convinced that 
Europeans had reached a new continent, rather than Asia. As a result, a German publisher, 
Martin Waldseemüller, produced a new map of the world in 1507. He called 
the new continent that Vespucci described America in his honor. 
The Impact of European Arms and Disease 
Th e Spanish governors who came aft er Columbus were more effi cient and more cruel. 
As they learned more about the lands and peoples that Columbus had claimed for 
them, Ferdinand and Isabella pressed harder for gold. They also ordered that the 
Indians be treated well and not enslaved. But Spanish governors focused on the gold 
and ignored the command to show kindness. Nicolás de Ovando who became governor 
on Hispaniola in 1502 set a pattern. He brought 2,500 Spanish settlers—families, 
not just male explorers—to build a permanent settlement. In the future, many Spanish 
explorers also married native women, creating new families of mixed ethnic heritage. 
Ovando attacked the Tainos ruthlessly. In 1502, he responded to a rebellion in Higüey 
by capturing 600–700 Indians and then ordering them all to be knifed to death and 
their bodies displayed. Later, in 1503, he convened an ostensibly friendly meeting 
of the caciques, the district chiefs, and when some 80 of them had assembled in one 
building, he ordered the doors locked and the building burned with them in it. With 
that act, the last independent chiefdoms of Hispaniola were ended. 
However, the most devastating thing that Columbus and his successors did was 
unintentional. They brought European diseases. The Tainos, like all natives of the 
Americas, had no immunity to smallpox, measles, or other diseases they had never 
known. In Europe where these diseases were common and had been for hundreds of 
years, many people had developed immunity to them or at least to their worst eff ects. 
American Indians had no such immunity. As a result, while Indians died by the hundreds 
from Spanish swords, they died by the thousands from disease. There were 
probably 1 million people on Hispaniola when Columbus landed in 1492. By the early 
1500s, only 1,000 Tainos were left . Within a century, all were gone. Th e European 
destruction of the fi rst people of the Americas had begun. 
From a total population of perhaps 70–80 million (no one really knows) when 
Columbus arrived, native peoples in both the Americas dropped to 4.5 million as a 
result of war and disease in the decades aft er the fi rst encounter. However unintentional 
the introduction of European disease was, the staggering numbers of Indian 
deaths made their conquest easy, and many Europeans were happy to take advantage 
of their already cleared land. For the Indians, tragedy followed tragedy. 
Soon, on the islands where Columbus fi rst landed, the only Indian descendants 
were people of mixed races. A Spanish census of 1514 indicated that 40 percent of 
the Spanish men had native wives. Th e arrival of African slaves in the 1500s added 
African blood to the mix. Today, many of the peoples of the Americas are descendants 
of all three of the groups that met in the Columbian encounter.

The Making of an Ocean World—The Atlantic and 
Columbian Exchange 
News of the new contact with the Americas changed the way many people looked at 
the world. Most educated Europeans already believed that the world was round and 
not fl at. But until 1492, they were concerned primarily with the land. Traders had long 
gone over land on the Silk Road established between Venice and China by Marco Polo 
between 1271 and 1295 that brought luxury goods to Europe from Asia. Portuguese 
sailors stayed close to the coast of Africa as they sailed around that continent to 
Asia. Norse sailors had explored the far North Atlantic—hopping from Iceland to 
Greenland, and on to the nearest parts of North America—seeking new fi shing opportunities. 
But Columbus and his successors did something diff erent; they sailed directly 
across the ocean, with no landmarks to guide their journey. Soon aft er that journey, 
the oceans—the Atlantic, the Indian, and very soon the Pacifi c—became the primary 
trade routes for Europeans, Americans, and increasing numbers of unwilling Africans. 
Nations that had ports on the Atlantic, especially Spain, Portugal, and England, moved 
from the margins of a land-focused Europe to become the key points of contact with 
an ocean-focused world. Th e shift from primarily land-based, or near-shore sea trade, 
to trade spanning the world’s oceans was a revolution in the way people thought, and 
it had winners and losers. 
Th e trade and cultural exchanges across the interconnected continents of Europe, 
Asia, and Africa and did not end aft er 1492, but the relationships were diff erent. Portugal 
and Spain replaced Genoa and Venice as the primary European links to Asia. Portuguese 
and Spanish ships dominated the Indian Ocean. Many other Spanish explorers followed 
Columbus in very short order. In addition to those who explored the Atlantic 
coast, Vasco Nunez de Balboa reached the Isthmus of Panama in 1513 and became the 
fi rst European to view the Pacifi c. In 1519, fi ve ships and their crews commanded by 
Ferdinand Magellan began a journey that led them around the tip of South America in 
1520 and across the Pacifi c to the Philippines, where Magellan himself was killed. Th ree 
years aft er they had departed, a handful of the explorers, on one ship, became the fi rst

The overland trading route first established 
by the Venetian trader Marco Polo in the late 
1200s. 
European diseases, especially smallpox, killed more of the original inhabitants of the Americas than any 
other cause. This illustration, originally done by Aztec scribes before their conquest, described “a great sickness” 
that came with sores “so terrible that the victims could not lie face down, nor on their backs, nor move 
from one side to the other.”

people to circumnavigate the globe, arriving back in Spain in 1522. Spanish galleons not 
only brought silver mined in the Americas across the Atlantic to Spain but soon also 
brought silver across the Pacifi c to Manila in the Philippines. (Manila itself was founded 
by Spanish traders in 1571.) Th e world of the 1500s was becoming an oceanic world 
including the Atlantic, the Indian Ocean, and the Pacifi c. Th e Atlantic Ocean that had 
been the great barrier on the western edge of Europe suddenly became the great highway 
connecting known and previously unknown continents. Portugal and Spain were 
the fi rst European states to establish trading routes across the oceans, but during the 
1500s, England, France, and Holland also assumed major roles in the new trade. 
As Europeans came to terms with the Americas, the people of the Americas also had 
to come to terms with Europe. For each there were gains and losses. What became known 
as the Columbian Exchange —the interchange of diseases, plants, animals, and human 
cultures between New and Old Worlds aft er 1492—refl ected some of these changes. 
Th e most tragic loss occurred with the transmission of disease-bearing microbes that 
devastated populations in the Americas. New populations began to emerge aft er 1492, 
when the peoples who met in the Americas produced off spring that carried the biological 
traits and the cultures of their ancestors from vastly diff erent parts of the world. 
Th e exchange also changed the eating habits of almost every person on the planet. 
In Europe, Asia, and Africa, foods such as corn, beans, peanuts, potatoes, cassava,

sweet potatoes, avocados, pineapples, tomatoes, chilies, vanilla, and cocoa from the 
Americas enriched people’s diets. Rice, wheat, barley, oats and many new fruits and 
vegetables from Europe, Africa, and Asia fed the American Indians as did chickens, 
cattle, sheep, and pigs (see Table 2–1). Horses changed the way many American 
Indians lived. A world without this variety is unimaginable today. 
The Conquest of the Aztec and Inca Empires 
Besides European diseases, the peoples of the Americas faced another threat: armed 
conquest. Hernán Cortés sailed from Cuba to Mexico with 600 soldiers in 1519. 
Within 2 years, he conquered Tenochtitlán, the Aztec capital, and renamed it Mexico 
City. When he fi rst arrived, some of the Aztecs may have thought Cortés might be their 
lost god Quetzalcoatl, who was said to have vanished from the place where Cortés 
landed. In their initial encounter, the Aztec Emperor Motecuhzoma (oft en written as 
Montezuma) welcomed Cortés. Th ey exchanged gift s, which Cortés saw as a sign of 
submission to Spain. Th e relationship soured quickly. Cortés took the emperor prisoner 
but allowed him to maintain a façade of rule. 
In July 1520, the Aztecs turned on Cortés, and he and his soldiers fl ed the capital. 
But they did not go far. With support from thousands of non-Aztec tribes— people 
who hated Aztec dominance and who hated having their people being used for 
the human sacrifi ces that Aztec religion demanded—the Spanish army regrouped 
and began a long, bloody siege of Tenochtitlán. Motecuhzoma himself was killed, 
probably by his own people, and Cortés completed his conquest of the city in 
August 1521. 
With Tenochtitlán destroyed, Cortés set about building a new and grander city 
on the same spot. On the site of the main Aztec temple, he ordered the building of a 
massive new Catholic cathedral modeled on the one at Granada, which had recently 
been built in the former Muslim stronghold in southern Spain. In both cases, the 
religious architecture symbolized the defeat of the “infi dels.” Within a generation, 
a thriving new Mexico City, fi lled with great churches and government palaces, had 
become the home of the Spanish viceroy—the king’s representative—and the capital 
of New Spain , as the Spanish called their empire in Mexico and Central America.

In 1532, in Peru, Francisco Pizarro and his army of 168 Spanish soldiers defeated 
the Inca Emperor Atahuallpa and his army of 80,000 soldiers. Within a few years, the 
Inca Empire of 32 million people, much larger than the Aztec Empire, had become the 
Viceroyalty of Peru, a second major outpost of distant Spain. Its primary purpose was 
to supply gold and silver to fi nance Spain’s European ambitions. At Potosí in Bolivia, 
45,000 slaves—at fi rst Indians then also Africans—worked the mines that created the 
wealth that made King Charles V and his son Philip II the richest and most powerful 
rulers in Europe. 
Th e swift ness of the Spanish conquest of the Aztec and Inca Empires was possible 
for many reasons. Aztec resistance was undermined by a sense of fatalism fueled 
by early visions of their own defeat. Many non-Aztecs joined with Cortés, more than 
happy to be rid of the Aztecs. Th e Incas could not imagine, and therefore did not fear, 
Pizarro’s initial surprise attack since he claimed to come in the name of friendship. 
Pizarro’s dishonesty in announcing that he was coming in friendship followed by his 
surprise attack was simply inconceivable to people reared in the long history of Inca 
civilization. And both empires found Spanish horses, swords, and armor terrifying. 
Th e ruthless military skill of Cortés and Pizarro and the Spanish mastery of guns, steel 
swords, and horses created an enemy who was simply unimaginable to Aztec and Inca 
armies and therefore very diffi cult to resist. Th e Aztecs and the Incas could not match 
the Spanish strategies and tools of war. 
Perhaps the most signifi cant Spanish advantage was smallpox. Th e Aztecs may 
have lost half of their population to smallpox during the 2 years of attack by Cortés 
on their capital, and the Incas faced the same terrifying losses. An Inca emperor 
had died from smallpox shortly before Pizarro arrived. Th e disease traveled at a far 
faster pace than even Spanish armies could march and often preceded them. For 
people used to living in harmony with nature, the terrible ravishing of the disease 
that occurred along with the arrival of these frightening white-skinned, bearded, and 
horse-mounted soldiers tore apart their world—militarily, culturally, and spiritually—
all in a very short time. 
In his popular book, Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fate of Human 
Societie s, Jared Diamond traces the unequal competition 
between different groups of humans from the beginning of 
recorded history to the present. His core question is why people 
of European origin came to dominate the planet pite the many 
advances Asians, Africans, and the peoples of the Americas made. 
In one chapter, he focuses on the early encounter of Europeans 
and Americans describing, “why the Inca Emperor Atahuallpa did 
not capture King Charles I of Spain.” The analysis focuses on the 
development of ideas, technology, and disease before 1492 that 
allowed Atahuallpa and some 80,000 followers to be defeated by 
just 168 Spaniards led by Pizarro. This kind of questioning is an 
important part of accurately understanding historical events.

Thinking Critically 
1. Chronological Reasoning 
What ideas in Inca society prior to 1492 contributed to their 
defeat? What developments in European society contributed 
to Spanish victory? 
2. Crafting an Argument 
In trying to explain the rapid European conquest of the 
Americas, how much emphasis would you place on 
advanced technology? What about disease? How about 
cultural differences? Since the Inca Empire was much larger 
than that of Spain in the 1530s, why did not Atahuallpa consider 
sailing across the Atlantic to conquer Spain?

Bartolomé de Las Casas and the Voices of Protest 
Spain’s treatment of the American Indians did not occur without protest. On 
Hispaniola, it was denounced within less than 20 years. In 1511, on a Sunday before 
Christmas, Antonio de Montesinos, a Dominican priest, asked his Spanish congregation, 
“Tell me, by what right do you keep these Indians in cruel servitude?…You are in 
mortal sin for the cruelty and tyranny you deal out to these innocent people. ” 
Bartolomé de Las Casas (1484–1566) may have heard Montesinos’s sermon. 
Certainly he had heard of it. Las Casas edited the log of Columbus’s journey and 
moved to Hispaniola to make his own fortune in 1502. Although he became a priest 
in 1510, he participated in the conquest of Cuba in 1512 and was rewarded with a 
large ranch, or encomienda , worked by Indian slaves. But his conscience bothered 
him. In 1514, he gave up the land and the slaves and began preaching and writing 
against the oppression of the Indians, which he continued to do for the next 50 years. 
Las Casas documented in detail the cruelty of the Spanish conquerors, begging the 
Spanish crown to stop the conquistadores , the soldiers who were creating the Spanish 
Empire in the Americas. 
Las Casas also left an important record of the life and customs of the fi rst peoples 
of the Americas. He wrote that among them, “marriage laws are nonexistent: men and 
women alike choose their mates and leave them as they please, without off ense, jealousy, 
or anger.” Th ey live, he wrote, in 
large communal bell-shaped buildings, housing up to 600 people at one time… 
made of very strong wood and roofed with palm leaves.…Th ey prize bird feathers 
of various colors, beads made of fi sh bones, and green and white stones with which 
they adorn their ears and lips, but they put no value on gold and other precious 
things.…They are extremely generous with their possessions and by the same 
token covet the possessions of their friends and expect the same degree of liberality. 
If they worshipped at all, it was not in a form that this Catholic priest recognized. 
Nevertheless, the key purpose of all of Las Casas’s writings was to ask the Spanish 
authorities to intervene to protect the Indians. He described seeing native people worked encomienda 
In the Spanish colonies, the grant to a 
Spanish settler of a certain number of 
American Indian subjects, who would pay 
him tribute in goods and labor. 
conquistadores 
The name given to the early Spanish 
conquerors of Mexico and Peru. 
Although he never left Europe, Theodore de Bry 
(1528–1598) spent many years drawing illustrations 
of European-Indian encounters based on 
fi rst-hand reports, including this one showing the 
attack by Spanish soldiers on an Indian village.

to death in the mines when “‘moderate labor’ turned into labor fi t only for iron men: 
mountains are stripped from top to bottom and bottom to top a thousand times; they dig, 
split rocks, move stones and carry dirt on their backs to wash it in rivers, while those who 
wash gold stay in the water all the time with their backs bent so constantly it breaks them.” 
Las Casas always believed, or at least hoped, that if the Spanish monarchs only 
knew the truth, Spain’s rulers would intercede. At times, the distant monarchs seemed 
to heed him. Shortly before her death, Isabella ordered that the Indians must be 
treated “as freemen and not as slaves, they must be given wages, they must be treated 
well [Christians should receive better treatment than non-Christians].” Las Casas was 
determined to show just how far reality departed from these orders. 
While Las Casas may have led the Spanish authorities to make a few reforms, 
the biggest eff ect of his work was not what he expected. He was writing during the 
Protestant Reformation, and Protestants, far more than Catholics, republished his 
words, creating what came to be known as the “Black Legend” (for the color of the 
priest’s robes) of unique Spanish cruelty. History would show that the Spanish were 
not unique in their treatment of American Indians, but the legend of their special cruelty 
persisted even as other Europeans adopted the same techniques and attitudes. 
American Voices 
Bartolomé de Las Casas, The History of the Indies, 1550 
T he publication of The History of the Indies , along with the many 
speeches and other writings from priests like Las Casas had 
multiple results. Las Casas clearly documented for all time just how 
cruel the first Europeans were in their treatment of the indigenous 
people of the Americas. On a few occasions, it led Spanish authorities 
to end some abuses or replace vicious officials, but such steps were 
rare and seldom had lasting effect. In the hands of enemies of Catholic 
Spain, the documents were used to create a long-lasting story of unique 
Spanish cruelty. Ultimately, the careful documentation created one of 
the best reports—even if a romanticized one—on the experience of 
American Indians at the time of their first encounter with Europeans. 
The following is an excerpt from Las Casas’s History : 
The men were sent out to the mines as far as 80 leagues away 
while their wives remained to work the soil, not with hoes or 
plowshares drawn by oxen, but with their own sweat and sharpened 
poles that were far from equaling the equipment used for 
similar work in Castile. They had to make silo-like heaps for cassava 
plants, by digging 12 square feet 4 palms deep and 10,000 
or 12,000 of such hills—a giant’s work—next to one another had 
to be made, and they had other tasks of the same magnitude 
of whatever nature the Spaniards saw as fittest to make more 
money. Thus husbands and wives were together only once every 
8 or 10 months, and when they met they were so exhausted and 
depressed on both sides that they had no mind for marital communication 
and in this way they ceased to procreate. As for the 
newly born, they died early because their mothers, overworked 
and famished, had no milk to nurse them, and for this reason, 
while I was in Cuba, 7,000 children died in 3 months. Some mothers 
even drowned their babies from sheer desperation, while 
others caused themselves to abort with certain herbs that produced 
stillborn children. In this way husbands died in the mines, 
wives died at work, and children died from lack of milk, while 
others had not time or energy for procreation, and in a short time 
this land, which was so great, so powerful and fertile, though so 
unfortunate, was depopulated. If this concatenation of events 
had occurred all over the world, the human race would have 
been wiped out in no time.

A DIVIDED EUROPE: THE IMPACT OF THE PROTESTANT 
REFORMATION 
Explain how the Protestant Reformation and the development of the nation-state changed 
Europe and European ideas about how best to settle and govern America. 
When Columbus sailed in 1492, he did so with a commission from the rulers of a 
newly unifi ed Spain. Spanish explorers and conquerors brought the same quest for 
unity to the America. Th ey sought to convert all native peoples to Catholic Christianity 
as part of the expansion of Spain’s realm. In 1492, few Western Europeans would disagree 
with that mission. Soon, however, Europe’s religious unity would disappear. 
Less than 30 years after Columbus made his voyage across the Atlantic, the 
Protestant Reformation changed the way Europeans thought about the world, whether 
they became Protestant or remained Catholic. Th e initial European encounter with the 
Americas was led by representatives of a religiously united Europe. But nearly all of the 
subsequent exploration and settlement of North America was conducted by Europeans 
who represented particular groups from a continent deeply divided by religious hostility. 
Th at divide shaped the way they understood their eff orts on both sides of the Atlantic. 
The Birth of Protestantism 
In 1517, before Hernán Cortés began his conquest of Mexico, a young German monk, 
Martin Luther (1483–1546), asked for a debate about religious doctrine by posting 
his N inety-Five Th eses on the door of a church in Wittenberg in the small independent 
German-speaking state of Saxony. At this time, some within the Roman Catholic 
Church began to challenge some of the church’s practices, prompted partly by new 
translations of the Bible and by new attention to the writings of Saint Augustine, a 
theologian of the early church. Th e challenges questioned the Catholic Church’s insistence 
that bishops and not everyday Christians should interpret the Bible and the idea 
that one could reach salvation through “good works.” In particular, the challenge that 
Luther posted questioned the Catholic practice of using indulgences that granted forgiveness 
to sinners to raise money. His action quickly led to a religious split, fi rst in 
Germany, and then across Europe. Th at split, known as the Protestant Reformation , 
would shape the cultural and political development of the future United States. 
A s word of Luther’s protests spread, many Germans, including signifi cant members of 
the nobility who controlled many of the small independent states of Germany, were drawn 
to the Lutheran cause. In the century that followed, other Protestants developed their 
own religious ideas, including followers of the French-Swiss reformer, John Calvin (1509– 
1564), who were known as Calvinists, while other Protestants went in other directions. 
Part of what fueled the extraordinary response to Luther’s challenge was the cumulating 
eff ect that the technology of printing had produced during the previous 62 years. 
Johannes Gutenberg’s creation of a printing press that used moveable type in 1455 
and the subsequent rapid spread of printing hugely expanded literacy beyond a small 
educated elite, mostly clergy, who had monopolized literacy in the medieval world. By 
1500, at least 10 million individual books had been printed, and many people learned 
to read; thus, new ideas could spread with a rapidity not known before. Sermons and 
pamphlets by Catholics, Lutherans, and Calvinists circulated rapidly. Th e printing press 
prompted a free fl ow of ideas that most people in Europe had not experienced before. 
Religion and the Nation-State 
Th e idea of the nation-state developed more or less at the same time as the Protestant– 
Catholic split. Th e modern idea that the world should be governed by independent nations, 
or nation-states, was new in the Europe of the 1500s. Indeed, a world divided into separate 
independent nations clashed with a long-standing ideal, held by many, of a unifi ed Europe— 
unifi ed in religion and government. In reality, the Europe of the 1400s was not united at

nation-state 
A relatively new development in Europe 
during the 1300s and 1400s in which nations 
became the major political organizations, 
replacing both the smaller kingdoms and 
city-states. 
Martin Luther’s challenge to Catholic teachings 
and practices in his day led to a decisive split in 
the unity among Christians that had been known 
in western Europe for centuries. Soon thereafter, 
John Calvin also challenged some of Luther’s 
teachings leading to a three way split between 
Catholics, Lutherans, and Calvinists—followed by 
further splits among Protestants.

all. Real power rested in very local territories. Frederick, Elector (or Duke) of Saxony, was 
Luther’s protector and had enough power to ensure Luther’s safety in spite of hostility from 
the Holy Roman emperor, the pope, and the kings of nearby France. But most of Europe’s 
modern nations did not exist. Even within the church, distance and the diffi culty of travel 
gave local Catholic bishops great independence from papal authorities in Rome. 
By the late 1400s, however, something new was emerging in European views of 
the best forms of government. Ferdinand and Isabella united Spain by 1492. Kings in 
France, Sweden, Scotland, and England had done the same earlier in the 1400s. Th e 
idea of being part of a nation was taking on new importance (see Map 2-2). 
Virtually no one argued in favor of religious freedom for the citizens of these 
nations. Instead, different religious parties, Catholics and assorted Protestants— 
Lutherans, Calvinists, and others—sought to impose their religious beliefs on as many 
others as possible. Each party argued that it was defending truth and saw no reason 
to tolerate those they believed were defending error. Th is belief in the absolute rightness 
of one’s cause led to more than a century of bloody persecution and religious 
wars from Ireland and Scotland to France, Germany, and Hungary. The Peace of 
Augsburg in 1555 that addressed divisions between Lutherans and Catholics and the 
Treaty of Westphalia that concluded the Th irty Years’ War between Catholics and 
Protestants in Central Europe in 1648 each provided that, in each nation covered by 
the treaty, the ruler would decide the faith of the people and that foreign armies would 
no longer intervene in the religious aff airs of another state. It was a long way from religious 
freedom, but it brought an end to the worst religious bloodshed while linking 
national unity and religious uniformity more tightly together than ever. 
The Protestant Reformation and the divisions that followed had a huge impact on 
European settlement in the Americas. Diff erent nations from a divided Europe battled with 
each other for control of those new lands. In addition, the wars and divisions in Europe led 
many to seek asylum in a new place, preferably as far away from the old as possible.

rest of the world? How would the link of religious and national unity in Spain and other parts

EXPLORATION AND ENCOUNTER IN NORTH AMERICA: THE SPANISH 
Analyze early Spanish exploration of America north of Mexico. 
Conquests of the Aztec and Inca Empires produced extraordinary wealth for Spain. 
Exploration further north in the Americas—in the future United States—was secondary 
for the conquistadores and much less lucrative for Spain. In spite of the wealth being 
generated from the empires in Mexico and Peru, for more than a century, most 
Europeans showed more interest in getting through or around North America and on to 
Asia than in exploring the lands north of New Spain. Nevertheless, the unknown lands 
north of Mexico beckoned to some Spaniards in the 1500s, even if they were not considered 
as exciting as Central and South America (see Map 2-3 ). 
Ponce de León in Florida, 1513–1521 
Juan Ponce de León, who had been part of the Spanish army that conquered Muslim 
Granada in 1492, led the fi rst known European expeditions to Puerto Rico and Florida. 
In 1508–1509 he founded the fi rst Spanish community near what would become San 
Juan and was named Governor of Puerto Rico. In 1513, he led an expedition from 
Puerto Rico that arrived in what he thought was another island, which he named La 
Florida. Legend says he was seeking a “Fountain of Youth” that would keep him forever 
young. Certainly he was seeking an expansion of Spain’s empire in the Americas 
and greater wealth for himself. Ponce de León was accompanied by free Africans 
whose families were slaves in Spain. Europeans, Africans, and the native peoples of the 
Americas fi rst met on the soil of the future United States when Ponce de León landed. 
In 1521, Ponce de León returned to Florida with some 200 followers—Europeans, 
Africans, and Indians from Puerto Rico. Th e Native Americans in Florida did not welcome 
them. Ponce de León was wounded by a poisoned arrow and died soon thereafter. 
But the fi rst of many contacts between native peoples and travelers from Europe 
and Africa in what are now the 50 United States had been made in Florida.

MAP 2-3 North American Exploration. In the fi rst one hundred years after Columbus, European explorers 
traveled along both the Atlantic and Pacifi c coasts and through much of the interior of what almost two 
hundred years later would become the United States. By 1592, however, most Europeans had concluded 
that there was no easy route through North America to Asia and little gold to be found so they lost interest 
in the regions north of Mexico.

Exploring Texas by Accident: Cabeza de Vaca, 1528–1536 
In 1528, there was another ill-fated eff ort to colonize Florida. Pánfi lo de Narváez sailed 
to Tampa Bay with about 400 men—Europeans and a few Africans. Th e Narváez expedition 
was a disaster. Leaving the ships in Tampa Bay, about 300 men spent months 
tramping through swamps seeking gold and, soon, merely food and water. Along the 
way, American Indians attacked them, shooting arrows that penetrated their heavy 
Spanish armor. Th e attackers quickly vanished into the forests and swamps while the 
surviving Spaniards tramped on wearing 50 to 60 pounds of heavy armor. 
Finally, ill, under attack, and starving, the survivors decided to build new boats 
and leave. Years later, one of them remembered: 
Th is seemed impossible to all, because we did not know how to build them, nor 
were there…one of all the things that are necessary, nor anyone who would 
know any way to apply ingenuity. And above all there was nothing to eat. 
Nevertheless, they built fi ve barges, and 250 men set out for what they hoped would be 
home. Instead, the currents, winds, and a hurricane took them west. Two or three of 
the fi ve barges survived the storm and came ashore near what is now Galveston, Texas. 
American Indians gave the survivors food, water, and shelter. Of the 80 explorers 
who survived the journey across the Gulf of Mexico, only 15 lived through the fi rst 
winter on the Texas coast (see Map 2-2 ). Th e others died of cold and disease. Many of 
the American Indian hosts also died of European diseases that the Spanish brought 
with them, and the surviving Indians grew hostile to these intruders who had brought 
so much disease and trouble. 
While others from the Narváez expedition may have lived out their lives among 
the American Indians of the Texas coast, only four of them, three Spaniards—Alvar 
Nunez Cabeza de Vaca, Andres Dorantes, Alonso del Castillo Maldonado—and an 
African Muslim slave from North Africa, named Esteban, decided to literally walk 
home to Mexico City. Thus, like Florida, Texas was explored by Europeans and 
Africans together, providing the Indians there with their fi rst exposure to both. Th e 
foursome’s 8-year adventure took them through southern Texas, the northern states 
of Mexico, and eventually to the Pacifi c coast and on to Mexico City. 
Th e four travelers found villages, developed a reputation as healers and traders, 
and collected a trove of information about American Indians who lived in permanent 
houses and had a good supply of corn and beans. Later Cabeza de Vaca described the 
ways of the people he met: 
When Indian men get into an argument in their villages, they fi st-fi ght until 
exhausted, then separate. Sometimes the women will go between and part 
them, but men never interfere. No matter what the disaff ection, they do not 
resort to bows and arrows.… 
All these [plains] tribes are warlike, and have as much strategy for protection 
against enemies as if they had been reared in Italy in continual feuds.…Whoever 
fi ghts them must show no fear and no desire for anything that is theirs.… 
I believe these people see and hear better and have keener sense in general 
than any in the world. Th ey know great hunger, thirst, and cold, as if they were 
made for enduring these more than other men, by habit and nature. 
De Vaca also described “a big copper rattle” that was given to them: 
It had a face represented on it, and the natives prized it highly.…It had been 
brought from the north, where there was a lot of it, replied the natives, who 
considered copper very valuable. Wherever it came from, we concluded the 
place must have a foundry to have cast the copper in hollow form. 
The American Indians refused to believe these men were of the same race as the 
Spaniards they had previously known. As Cabeza de Vaca wrote, the four explorers 
appeared to be distinct from earlier Spanish invaders because, “we cured the sick and 
they killed those who were healthy, and that we came naked and barefoot and they

were clothed and on horseback and with lances, and…had no other purpose but to 
steal everything they found.” 
When the four explorers fi nally reached Mexico City in 1536, their story inspired 
further exploration. Th e expeditions that followed, however, did not heed the four 
explorers’ peaceful approach to interactions but were, instead, motivated by suggestions 
of astounding riches. 
Exploring the Southwest: Esteban, de Niza, and Coronado, 1539–1542 
Th e four Texas explorers found great interest as they told their story in Mexico City. In their 
8 years living with American Indians, the Spaniards heard stories of seven wealthy and 
powerful cities with buildings of four or fi ve stories and copper, silver, and gold everywhere, 
upriver on the Rio Grande. For the Spaniards, stories of fabulous wealth were alluring. 
A Spanish legend seemed to further validate what the four Texas explorers shared. 
Th e legend told about seven Christian bishops who had fl ed from the Muslim invasion 
of Spain in the 700s and established seven wealthy cities far to the west. As the Spanish 
community in Mexico City heard the stories brought from Texas, many of them remembered 
both the wealth that Cortés had found and the ancient stories of the fl eeing bishops. 
Th e Texas survivors showed the copper rattle they had been given, which added to 
the allure. Many in Mexico City now wanted to explore the territory to their north. 
In 1539, a Franciscan brother Marcos de Niza, led an expedition to fi nd the fabled cities. 
De Niza asked Esteban, the African who had walked across Texas, to scout for them. 
Th us an African was the fi rst non-Indian many of the Pueblo peoples met. Esteban knew 
that the Native Americans had never seen a black person. From his years in Texas, he also 
thought he knew what would impress them : he wore feathers, bells, and turquoise and 
took on aspects of a god. He sent messages back to De Niza indicating that he had come to 
wealthy towns. Esteban enjoyed his role until he came to the Zuni Pueblo of Hawikuh. Th e 
Zuni told Esteban to leave. When he threatened them, they killed him. De Niza came far 
enough north to see Hawikuh from a distance, but he did not want to risk Esteban’s fate. 
He returned to Mexico City and reported to the viceroy that the city “is better seated than 
any I have seen in these parts,” and he said “I was told that there is much gold there, and 
the natives make it into vessels and jewels for their ears, and into little blades with which 
they wipe away their sweat.” De Niza was careful not to claim more than he had seen. He 
had seen irrigated fi elds, buff alo hides, and—from a distance—populous towns, and he 
had only heard reports of gold and great wealth. Nevertheless, such a report was enough 
to launch further expeditions. De Niza had also heard a name for the region—Cibola. 
From then on, the search for the Seven Cities of Cibola became the stuff of legend. 
In 1540, Francisco Vázquez de Coronado led a large expedition across what is now 
the U.S.-Mexican border into modern Arizona. At the Zuni pueblo of Hawikuh, in the 
confederation of Cibola, they had their fi rst battle with the American Indians of the 
Southwest. Th e Zunis did not take kindly to the demand that they submit to previously 
unheard of Spanish authority. Coronado’s men had gone without adequate food for 
quite some time by this point, and they attacked the village, primarily to gain access to 
food. Th e Coronado expedition then turned east to central New Mexico. Although the 
Spanish found many communities along the Rio Grande, the Pueblo Indians of the 
area were no more enthusiastic about submitting to Spanish power or supplying the 
Spanish with food and provisions than the Zuni had been. Th e Pueblos quickly found 
that, rather than fi ght, the best solution seemed to be to keep the Spanish moving by 
assuring them that the real wealth was just over the horizon. 
In 1541, the expedition set off into what are now northern Texas, Oklahoma, and 
Kansas. Th e Spaniards met Teya Indians, seminomadic peoples who had found ways to 
live well in a harsh countryside far better than the Spaniards could. Coronado and his men 
did not, however, fi nd gold or European-style cities. Finally, discouraged and with their 
supplies gone, they returned to Mexico City in 1542 with little to show for their eff orts. It 
was decades before Spanish authorities would try again to settle in Arizona or New Mexico.

Exploring the Mississippi River Valley: The De Soto 
Expedition, 1539–1542 
While Coronado was roaming the Southwest, another Spanish adventurer, Hernando 
de Soto, was exploring even more of the future United States. De Soto had won fame 
and gold through military exploits in Panama in the 1520s, and had been a part of 
Pizarro’s conquest of the Inca Empire in the 1530s. He was then given a royal charter to 
settle La Florida and the lands beyond. He would try again where Ponce de León and 
De Narváez had failed. In 1539, he sailed to Florida with some 500 to 600 Spaniards 
and about 100 captive American Indians and Africans. Th e expedition also brought 
blacksmiths to make chains for the new slaves they expected to capture. 
In northern Florida, near modern-day Tampa, they saw fi elds of corn and large towns 
led by powerful rulers. In 1540, the expedition moved into Georgia and the Carolinas. 
In a place they called Cofi tachiqui, probably a Creek Indian village, the ruler, a young 
woman, greeted De Soto and “presented unto him great store of clothes of the country… 
and took from her own neck a great cordon of pearls, and cast it about the neck of the 
Governor, entertaining him with very gracious speeches of love and courtesy.” De Soto 
responded by taking the princess prisoner and demanding that she guide his expedition 
over the Appalachian mountains to the gold he sought. She did lead them over the 
mountains, but then escaped, taking the pearls that she had given De Soto home with 
her. Other Indians who happened to be in De Soto’s path would not be so fortunate. 
As the expedition crossed the Appalachian Mountains into Tennessee, and on 
into Alabama and Mississippi, they were met by Native Americans bringing gift s; the 
Spaniards quickly tried to make the natives into guides and slaves. But as word of the 
Spaniards spread, they found fewer gift s and more hostility. De Soto reported wellpopulated 
lands. Later European explorers, however, found far fewer Indians, most 
likely because of diseases unintentionally brought by De Soto’s expedition. 
In 1541, De Soto crossed the Mississippi River and explored what is now Arkansas 
and probably modern-day Texas. When they turned back to the Mississippi River, 
De Soto demanded that a nearby Native American town provide supplies and porters 
to help with the river crossing. When the village chief refused, De Soto ordered his 
soldiers to destroy the town; his journal reports that “the cries of the women and children 
were such as to deafen those who pursued them.” 
Jacques Le Moyne, an early French colonist in 
Florida, drew this picture of an Indian queen being 
carried by high-ranking men. While the picture is 
from the later 1500s in Florida, the princess that 
the de Soto expedition met a few years earlier may 
well have been treated with similar respect.

De Soto himself died of fever on June 20, 1542. His fellow explorers sunk his body 
in the Mississippi River so the now-hostile Indians would not know their leader was 
gone. Th en they built raft s and drift ed down the river. Aft er considerable hardship, 
311 survivors—about half the original group—reached Mexico. Th ey had not found 
much in North America that interested them. 
Exploring California: The Cabrillo Voyage, 1542–1543 
While Coronado was exploring New Mexico and De Soto the Mississippi Valley, the 
Spanish authorities commissioned Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo to investigate the Pacifi c 
Coast. Cabrillo had come to New Spain as a young man and amassed a fortune, which 
he was prepared to use to outfi t his own expedition in hopes of great returns. In 1542, 
Cabrillo sailed north from Mexico along the Pacifi c Coast with three ships “to discover 
the coast of New Spain” and continue until he reached China, which was assumed 
to be not far distant. Cabrillo’s three ships left Navidad, Mexico, in June 1542, and 
by September had reached San Diego Bay in California. Th ey exchanged gift s with 
friendly American Indians and reported seeing a beautiful land of valleys, savannas, 
high mountains, and smoke that indicated a large native population. Cabrillo called 
California a “good country where you can make a settlement.” 
He continued north along the Pacifi c Coast as far as the Russian River in northern 
California. Like many after him, Cabrillo overlooked the area of what is now San 
Francisco because of the heavy fog. He did, however, realize that in Monterey Bay— 
the future capital of Spanish and Mexican California—there was a fi ne harbor. Aft er 
Cabrillo died of an injury while trying to rescue some of his men from an attack, the 
expedition returned to Mexico. Th ey had found neither China nor the gold they sought. 
Early Settlements in Florida: Fort Caroline and St. Augustine, 1562–1565 
Aft er all these failed eff orts, Spanish interest in the lands north of Mexico waned. Th e 
fi rst actual European settlements in North America refl ected the growing divisions 
in Europe itself. Catholic Spain now had to compete with France—a nation divided 
between Catholicism and Protestantism—and with Protestant England and Holland. 
Only when these other European powers showed an interest in North America did 
Spain set up permanent settlements there. 
No nation was more deeply split by the Protestant-Catholic divide than France, which 
had a large Protestant minority and a strong Catholic majority. It was from the French 
Protestants that the fi rst settlers in Florida were recruited. In 1562, Gaspard de Coligny, 
a French Protestant nobleman and admiral, commissioned expeditions to Florida. 
Although there was no European settlement in Florida, it seemed to be a strategic location 
on the sea lanes between Spain’s empire in Mexico and South America and Spain itself. 
As a loyal subject of the French king, Coligny wanted to secure lands for France. He also 
wanted to create a safe haven for his fellow Protestants. In 1562, Coligny commissioned 
Jean Ribault to make an initial trip to Florida, and then commissioned a larger French 
expedition, including many families with their livestock, supplies, and tools, which sailed 
in 1564. Th e settlers moved to the mouth of the St. Johns River where Jacksonville, Florida, 
is today and built a town they named Fort Caroline aft er King Charles IX of France. Th ey 
meant to stay and build their lives there. It would be a useful outpost for France, yet far 
enough away to avoid the political and religious turmoil of their homeland. 
The Spanish, however, considered this colony a major religious, political, and 
commercial threat to Spain’s control of the Americas. Pedro Menéndez de Avilés was 
given jurisdiction of a new Spanish colony to reach from Florida to Newfoundland 
and told to establish cities in Florida and oust the French Protestants. He did both. 
In 1565, Menéndez de Avilés founded St. Augustine, today the oldest city of 
European origin in the United States. All the lands north and west of it, he declared, 
now belonged to the king of Spain. He began a friendly trade with the Timuca Indians

who lived in northern Florida and sought to convert them to Catholicism. The 
Timucas valued Spanish goods and provided the colony with food, root vegetables, 
wild fruit, fi sh, oysters, game, and corn, but they resisted religious conversion. Having 
established St. Augustine, De Avilés attacked Fort Caroline, killing all its inhabitants. 
When the French fl eet coming to aid Fort Caroline was shipwrecked along the coast 
by a hurricane, De Avilés killed the survivors, too. Florida would remain in Spanish 
hands for centuries, and its bloody European beginnings mirrored Europe’s divisions. 
Th e founders of Spain’s fi rst colonies in North America, like those who settled 
in Latin America, refl ected the spirit of the Reconquista , or “reconquest,” of Spain 
itself when both Muslims and Jews were driven out of the country and religious and 
national unity were seen as one and the same. For hundreds of years, soldiers of 
Christian Spain fought against Muslims, whom they considered infi dels, seeking to 
win military glory, wealth, and spiritual honor on the battlefi eld. It was a worldview 
in which religious fervor and military bravery were united in the service of the nation. 
Aft er the victory over the last Muslim stronghold in Spain in 1492, the next generation 
of Spanish men could not hope for the success of their fathers, grandfathers, and 
great-grandfathers in Spain itself, but they brought the same mixture of military heroics 
and religious fervor to the Americas. In the 1500s, a way of looking at the world 
and especially at conquest that had been reshaping Spain itself for hundreds of years 
became the key to creating an ever-expanding empire in the Americas. 
Cultural practices in Spain and other parts of Europe at the time may have also 
played a role in how ruthless the early Europeans were. Under a system of primogeniture, 
land was typically passed on to the oldest son. Younger sons, then, would not

have the same opportunities to acquire land and the wealth that went with it. Some 
would opt to spend their lives in the church, but many would opt to spend their lives 
as soldiers where, through conquest of new lands, they might be rewarded. 
Unlike Mexico and Peru, the Spanish colonies in Florida were settled by soldiers 
who did not want to create a vast empire but valued the independence that distance 
from imperial authorities gave them and by families of artisans and farmers who 
meant to build a richer life than they could have in Spain. As citizens on the border 
between European settlement and American Indian territory, these settlers wanted 
to enjoy the municipal liberties that the free cities of Castile had enjoyed when they 
had represented the border between Christian and Muslim Spain. Th ey also wanted to 
avoid the tightly ordered hierarchical society that was evolving in Mexico. Th e cities 
and the farms in Florida prospered. One settler recorded, “I have planted with my own 
hands grapevines, pomegranates, orange trees and fi gs, wheat, barley, onions, garlic 
and many vegetables that grow in Spain.” Th e colonists quickly took to the corn that 
was the staple of the Indian diet. 
Th ere were also slaves in St. Augustine from the beginning. Although his royal 
commission had authorized him to bring up to 500 African slaves to St. Augustine, 
De Avilés actually brought only about 50. In time, Spanish Florida had a black militia 
and included both African slaves and free Africans. 
There was also intermarriage and more casual sexual encounters among 
Europeans, Native Americans, and Africans in Spanish Florida. In this outpost, the 
races blended, creating a new culture and new bloodlines. In addition, St. Augustine 
became a place where Europeans from other nations settled. Some settled of necessity 
aft er their ships were wrecked on the Florida coast. Others came to escape legal problems, 
military commitments, or families. Despite strict rules issued in Madrid, isolated 
places like St. Augustine refl ected considerable diversity, including Jews escaping an 
increasingly intolerant Europe as well as French, Flemish, and German immigrants 
escaping religious persecution or simply wanting a new start in life. 
Aft er its founding in 1565 and up until 1705, St. Augustine was home to a largescale 
eff ort to send Franciscan missionaries into the surrounding Native American territories. 
Th e Franciscans who traveled into the interior of Florida and Georgia to make 
converts also sought alliances with the Indians. Tribal leaders came to St. Augustine 
to trade and negotiate, and they accepted, however casually, Spanish rule. Eventually, 
about 80 mission centers were established from the Savannah River in Georgia to as 
far south as modern Daytona Beach. Th e Franciscans, however, also brought European 
diseases along with their preaching, and the American Indian population fell drastically. 
Nevertheless, for a century, Native Americans, missionaries, and soldiers traded 
religious and cultural ideas as well as the tools of commerce and war. Th ey intermarried 
and substantially infl uenced each other and their off spring in Florida. 
Despite occasional battles with the American Indians, raids by European navies, 
and hurricanes, life in Spanish Florida continued more or less uninterrupted well 
into the 1700s. While the English focused their eff orts further north and the Spanish 
Empire centered on Mexico, Central, and South America, those who were in Florida 
were left alone. Except for a brief period of British rule between 1763 and 1784, Florida 
remained a Spanish colony until it was ceded to the United States in 1821, 256 years 
aft er the founding of St. Augustine. 
Settling New Mexico: 1598 
Aft er Coronado’s expedition to explore the North American Southwest returned to 
Mexico City in 1542, there was little further exploration of New Mexico for over half 
a century. Th en in 1598, the Spanish viceroy in Mexico City decided it was time for 
another look at the lands of the north and appointed a new governor for what was 
called “New Mexico.” Th e rumors that great wealth existed there had never died. More 
pragmatically, the Spanish were worried about the Protestant English. In 1579, Francis

Drake, an English privateer (a pirate working for the government), sailed up the coast 
of California, duplicating Cabrillo’s route (and his failure to fi nd San Francisco). Drake 
then turned west and duplicated the route of an earlier Spanish explorer, Ferdinand 
Magellan, sailing across the Pacific and on around the world before returning to 
London in 1580. To the authorities in Spain, this achievement was a real threat. Settling 
the interior of North America suddenly seemed imperative. 
Don Juan de Oñate was appointed governor of New Mexico with instructions not 
to follow the harsh policies of Cortés or Pizarro. Th e King’s appointment letter said, 
“You will endeavor to attract the natives with peace, friendship, and good treatment… 
and to induce them to hear and accept the holy gospel.” A succession of Spanish monarchs 
never approved of the viciousness of the conquistadors, though they accepted 
the gold and silver that fl owed back to Spain without asking too many questions about 
how it was acquired. 
Oñate’s expedition included 400 men, women, and children, among them a few 
Spanish soldiers, Franciscan friars, and Indians, along with supply wagons, cattle, 
sheep, and mules. Oñate’s wife, Isabel Tolosa Cortés Montezuma, was herself a granddaughter 
of Cortés and a great-granddaughter of the Aztec emperor Montezuma. On 
April 30, 1598, the expedition stopped on the banks of the Rio Grande and claimed 
all of the lands and peoples to the north for Spain. Oñate named the place where he 
crossed the river El Paso del Norte the “pass to the north.” Since Coronado’s day, the 
Pueblo Indians had seen Spanish soldiers and missionaries come and go. Th e Spanish 
could be ruthless, but they also seemed to have little staying power. With the Oñate 
expedition, Spanish occupation of New Mexico would come closer to being permanent. 
Oñate sought political allegiance from the Pueblos of southern New Mexico. 
In July 1598, he asked Pueblo chiefs to swear allegiance to Spain and convert to 
Christianity. Oñate chose to interpret their lack of hostility as agreement. He also built 
a capital, which he named San Gabriel. Something resembling a permanent settlement 
of 400 Europeans in the middle of thousands of Pueblo Indians took shape. 
At fi rst all was peaceful. Oñate divided New Mexico into administrative districts, 
each with a priest in each to try to convert the American Indians to Christianity. 
He allowed self-government to continue in each pueblo—he had little choice—but 
insisted that each one must have a political governor. He was more interested in 
exploring for the gold, silver, or pearls, which he was sure were just over the horizon, 
and did not try to force the Native Americans to labor for the Spanish. 
Th e peace did not last, however. Zutucapan, the leader of the Acoma Pueblo, had 
avoided meeting Oñate because he did not want to cede any authority to the Spaniards. 
Late in 1598, he attacked a Spanish scouting party, and in 1599, Oñate struck back. 
Aft er a fi erce battle, the Spaniards, whose guns, swords, and horses gave them a huge 
advantage, burned Acoma to the ground. One thousand of its residents were killed, 
and the remaining 500 were taken as slaves. Th e male captives had one foot cut off . 
When the Jumano Indians also resisted Oñate, he hanged their chiefs and burned 
their village. 
Oñate’s cruelty and his failure to fi nd riches led to his recall in 1609. Th e new royal 
governor Don Pedro de Peralta moved the capital further north to a new town that 
he created and named Santa Fe, in1610. Th ere Peralta built the oldest public building 
still standing in the United States—the governor’s mansion. Th e colony’s attention 
turned from gold to farming. Churches were built at the center of each pueblo. 
Th e Spanish hoped these churches would become new centers of Indian life and faith, 
but tensions would continue that would eventually culminate some 50 years later in a 
surprising revolt.

EXPLORATION AND ENCOUNTER IN NORTH AMERICA: THE FRENCH 
Analyze early French exploration and claims in North America. 
King Francis I of France (r. 1515–1547) did not want to leave the Americas to Spain 
or Portugal (which was quickly developing its own empire in Brazil). In 1524, some 
30 years aft er Columbus made his journey, the French king commissioned an Italian 
sailor, Giovanni da Verrazano, to explore the Atlantic coast and fi nd a sea route to 
Asia for France. Verrazano sailed from Florida to Newfoundland but concluded that 
an entire continent divided the Atlantic from the Pacifi c. Aft er Verrazano, French 
interest in North America focused further north, on the St. Lawrence River Valley 
and what became Canada, especially after Jacques Cartier’s visit of 1534 to that 
region, and aft er the destruction of Fort Caroline in 1565, as well as on islands in the 
Caribbean. Eventually, while the Spanish explored the Mississippi River Valley north 
from the Gulf of Mexico, the French would explore the same river coming south from 
their settlements near the Mississippi’s headwaters and tributaries in what is today 
the Midwest. 
First French Visit to the Atlantic Coast of the United States— 
Verrazano, 1524 
Verrazano’s ship La Dauphine left France in January 1524 and landed on what is now 
Cape Fear, North Carolina, 2 months later. He described the people he met there as, 
“of color russet, and not much unlike the Saracens; their hair black, thick, and not very 
long.” He wondered if they might be Chinese. 
On April 17, 1524, Verrazano became the fi rst European to sail into New York 
Harbor, describing how the inhabitants of Manhattan “came towards us very cheerfully, 
making shouts of admiration, showing us where we might come to land most 
safely with our boat.” He continued north, visiting Rhode Island’s Narragansett Bay, 
Maine, and Newfoundland, and he mapped much of the Atlantic Coast of the future 
United States and Canada before returning to France. 
Jacques Cartier Seeks a Sea Route to Asia, 1534 
In 1534, France tried again to fi nd a northern sea route to Asia. Jacques Cartier was 
authorized to make the eff ort for France. Cartier did not fi nd the route—which did not 
exist except through then-frozen Arctic ice—but he explored Newfoundland and the 
gulf of the St. Lawrence River, laying the basis for future French claims to these lands. 
He also began a trade in furs that would have great signifi cance for French and English 
relations with American Indians. 
On a second voyage in 1535–1536, Cartier explored the St. Lawrence River far 
upstream (see Map 2-2 ), coming to the sites of Quebec and Montreal. More than a 
thousand friendly Indians came to the river to greet him. He traded European goods, 
including knives, for food, beginning a trading relationship that would transform the 
lives of native tribes and Europeans. But Cartier stayed too long, and when the winter 
closed in, he could not return to France because the river froze over. Cartier spent 
a terrible winter on the St. Lawrence, buried in deep snow and losing a quarter of 
his crew to disease and cold. Although Cartier’s travels would be the basis for future 
French land claims, it would be another half-century before the French developed a 
serious interest in North America, aft er they discovered that there was no quick way 
around it to the Asian lands they really wanted to fi nd.

EXPLORATION AND ENCOUNTER IN NORTH AMERICA: THE ENGLISH 
Explain English explorers, privateers, and reasons for settlement. 
Although Spanish conquistadors were the leading explorers of the Americas, an Englishled 
expedition was among the fi rst to follow Columbus. King Henry VII of England commissioned 
another Italian, Giovanni Caboto, or John Cabot, to sail across the Atlantic in 
1497. Cabot made landfall in North America, most likely in Newfoundland, and may have 
traveled as far south as Maine. He did not meet any people, but erected a cross and banner 
to claim the lands for England. When he returned to London, he was given a rich reward. 
In 1498, Cabot set out on a second voyage, but he and his companions disappeared— 
most likely their ships were sunk in a storm—and there is no clear evidence of further 
English discoveries or claims in the Americas until more than 50 years later when a very 
diff erent England found new reasons to look more carefully across the Atlantic. 
England’s Reformation Shapes the Country 
In the early years of the Protestant Reformation, few would have predicted that 
England would break with the Roman Catholic Church. When he became king in 1509, 
Henry VIII was a good Catholic. He even wrote a defense of traditional Catholic doctrine 
that led the pope to give him the title “Defender of the Faith.” He had married Catherine 
of Aragon, daughter of the devoutly Catholic Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain. His closest 
advisor was Catholic Cardinal Th omas Wolsey. But Henry’s marriage problems would 
eventually reshape the country and help it gain a powerful role in the Atlantic World. 
By the late 1520s, Henry wanted to end his marriage with Catherine. Five of their six 
children had died. Only a daughter named Mary survived, and Henry wanted a male heir. 
He had also fallen in love with Anne Boleyn, a young woman at the court. Under pressure 
from the king, the English clergy had agreed to dissolve the marriage. But Pope Clement VII 
needed political support from Catherine’s nephew, Charles V, King of Spain and Holy Roman 
Emperor, who opposed the divorce. Th e pope stalled and refused to approve the divorce. 
A century, even a decade, earlier Henry would have had little room to maneuver. 
Now the Protestant Reformation gave him an opening. In 1534, Parliament passed 
legislation ending papal authority in England and declared Henry and his successors 
to be “the only Supreme Head in earth of the Church of England.” Henry annulled 
his marriage to Catherine, married Anne, and celebrated the birth of a new daughter, 
Elizabeth, though he still longed for a son. He closed monasteries and sold off church 
land or used it to reward loyal followers. Henry did not embrace many Protestant 
teachings. Other than substituting his own authority for that of the pope, official 
Christianity in England remained closer to Catholicism than to the Protestantism of 
Luther or Calvin, a fact that would become especially signifi cant in the next century. 
When Henry died in 1547, England had three major religious groups. Some, 
known as Anglicans , were perhaps a majority and supported Henry’s arrangement, 
including independence from the pope and preserving traditional Catholic religious 
forms. However, a growing Protestant minority, known as Puritans , wanted more 
radical religious change to “purify” the Church of England of Catholic practices, especially 
the leadership of bishops. In addition, many Roman Catholics could not agree to 
the break with Rome and remained loyal to the Catholic Church. 
Henry’s successor was his 9-year-old son Edward VI (r. 1547–1553) from the king’s 
marriage to his third wife, Jane Seymour, aft er he tired of Anne and had her executed. 
In the end, Henry had six wives but only three children. Th e boy-king’s regents sought 
to make the English church more Protestant in its doctrines and rituals. But when 
Edward died at age 15, his half-sister Mary I became queen and returned England— 
briefl y—to Catholicism. However, Mary also died aft er a reign of only 5 years. In 1558, 
Elizabeth I (r. 1558–1603), daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, succeeded her.

Elizabeth’s reasons for embracing Protestantism 
were strong. If England were Catholic, then Henry’s 
marriage to her mother would be illegal, and Elizabeth 
would be an illegitimate child and unable to assume 
the throne. If England were Protestant, she had every 
right to be queen of England. And Elizabeth meant to 
be queen. She did not want her subjects fighting with 
each other, however. In the Act of Uniformity of 1559, 
Parliament declared that she was “Supreme Governor” 
of the Church of England. Worship should follow 
the Book of Common Prayer , which preserved many 
Catholic rituals within a Protestant theology. Every 
person in England was required to attend church once 
a week or face a fine. Catholics who refused to break 
with Rome were persecuted. But as long as Protestants 
agreed to the Act of Uniformity and to attend church 
services that followed the Book of Common Prayer , 
Elizabeth’s government left them free to disagree about 
their beliefs to their heart’s content. 
During Elizabeth’s long reign, England became a 
major power in Europe and the world. Spain, under 
King Philip II, grandson of Ferdinand and Isabella, was at the center of a Catholic 
revival, and Philip’s Spain and Elizabeth’s England became bitter rivals. Queen 
Elizabeth subsidized Protestant rebels against Spain’s rule of the Netherlands and 
even engaged in a correspondence with Ottoman Sultan Murad III about a possible 
joint Protestant-Muslim attack on Catholic Spain. King Philip, in return, plotted 
Elizabeth’s overthrow and made plans to invade England to secure Spain’s power and 
protect Catholic unity. 
When Spain attacked England in July 1588, Spain’s navy, known as the Spanish 
Armada, was defeated by the English navy and destroyed by storms. After 1588, 
England’s navy dominated the Atlantic and eventually all of the world’s oceans. 
English sailors grew more skilled, the country’s shipbuilders became more sophisticated 
in their designs, and its navigators gained new understanding of winds and currents 
as well as their charts and instruments. For Elizabeth and many of her subjects, 
the defeat of the threatened Spanish Catholic invasion linked the Protestant religion 
and English patriotism indissolubly in their minds. A small nation, on the margins of 
Europe, was suddenly a major player in an emerging Atlantic world. 
Elizabethan Explorers and Pirates 
While Elizabeth I ruled England, English adventurers, with her support, set out to make a 
place for themselves in the new oceanic world. English and other European fi shermen had 
fi shed off the North Atlantic coast of North America since the early 1500s. By the 1580s, 
however, warfare and piracy became the dominant role of the English who visited the 
Americas. Building settlements at that time was not a priority. If powerful Catholic Spain 
was exploiting the continents for gold and silver, England saw no reason not to relieve the 
Spanish ships of some of their treasure without going to the trouble of mining it themselves. 
Francis Drake was perhaps the most famous pirate—or privateer as they were 
known when their exploits were commissioned by the government. Drake was licensed 
for piracy by Queen Elizabeth. Licensing individual captains to harass the Spanish treasure 
fl eets was far cheaper than supporting a large royal navy, and the English government, 
at minimal risk, kept a fi ft h of whatever the pirates brought to England. Indeed, 
pirates may have supplied 10 percent of English imports in the 1590s. Th e decades of 
legalized piracy also helped expand the technical knowledge of English mariners. Th e 
role of this piracy was instrumental in laying a foundation for England’s sea power. 
Queen Elizabeth ruled England from 1558 to 
1603 during which time the country prospered 
internally and emerged as a major sea power in 
the world.

HOW DID GLOBAL 
EXPLORATION CHANGE 
THE OLD AND NEW 
WORLD? 
Beginning in the 1400s, explorers left 
Europe and headed west in search of 
faster trade routes to Asia to keep up 
with the growing European demand for 
luxury goods such as silk and spices. 
In the process, they encountered 
huge civilizations in the Americas: 
complex societies that often had 
high levels of economic and social 
interconnectedness. Over the next 2 
centuries, Europeans attempted to 
conquer these Native American societies 
by force, set up colonies, and establish 
trade ties, connecting the Old World 
(Europe, Asia, and Africa) with the New 
World (the Americas). This Age of Global 
Exploration had a profound impact 
on world history and was especially 
destructive to societies in the Americas 
as vast numbers of people in New World 
succumbed to Old World diseases.

Chapter 2 First Encounters, First Conquests 53 
Francis Drake was an explorer as well as a privateer. During his voyage around 
the globe from 1577 to 1580—the fi rst commander of such an expedition to survive— 
he confi rmed the contours of the Americas for the English. He then continued across the 
Pacifi c and around Africa before returning to London. In 1585, he attacked and burned 
St. Augustine, Florida. In 1588, he helped defeat the Spanish Armada. His exploits 
brought considerable wealth to Queen Elizabeth’s England while weakening Spanish 
control of the seas. By the time Drake died in1596, while again harassing the Spanish in 
Central America, English sailors were confi dent that they could travel anywhere without 
trouble, even if Spain still controlled the most valuable land in the Americas. 
Walter Raleigh and the “Lost Colony” of Roanoke 
In 1584, an ambitious young man, Walter Raleigh, was authorized by England to 
use his own funds to occupy lands in North America. Raleigh’s role was to fund and 
authorize the missions. At the time, England and Raleigh himself were most interested 
in establishing a base from which privateers like Drake could easily operate and profi t 
fi nancially from these missions. Th e fi rst mission in 1584 was a reconnaissance trip to 
identify potential sites. Th e small group discovered Roanoke Island and was received 
warmly by the Algonquian people, two of whom (Manteo and Wanchese) returned 
to England with the crew. In 1585, Raleigh sent 100 young men back 
to Roanoke on the Outer Banks of North Carolina along with the two 
Algonquian emissaries. It was the fi rst English colony in what is now the 
United States. It was also short lived. When the men landed, one of their 
ships ran aground, and most of the food they had brought was ruined. 
Th e Roanoke Indians were not happy to feed the colonists whom they 
began to suspect of trying to dominate them, and a battle broke out in 
1586 in which the Roanoke chief, Wingina, was killed. When Francis 
Drake arrived later that spring to rest his crews and refi t his ships, he 
found the survivors in disarray. Instead of refi tting, he agreed to take the 
survivors back to England when they decided to abandon the colony. 
Raleigh was not discouraged, however. If a colony of men could 
not succeed, then perhaps one composed of families could. In 1587, 
he convinced English investors to create a new colony in a location on 
the Chesapeake Bay, which would have more navigable waters than the 
shallows around Roanoke. Colonists were promised 500 acres per family, 
a huge estate for the times, though one might question England’s 
authority to give away land claimed by the Algonquians. Some 100 
people left England to create this new colony, but events along the way 
landed them instead back at Roanoke, amid the Algonquians who had 
fought their predecessors. Nevertheless the colony was established, 
houses built, and the settlers began their new lives in this isolated place. 
Virginia Dare was born and baptized in this colony soon aft er the families 
arrived. She was the fi rst English child known to be born in what is 
now the United States. 
But the 1587, Roanoke colony also failed. Indeed, it came to be 
known as the “Lost Colony.” Th e settlers had been left in what seemed 
like reasonably good shape with a promise that resupply ships would 
arrive the following spring. However, no ships were allowed to leave 
England in 1588 because of the threatened Spanish attack. Th e government 
commandeered every ship to oppose the mighty Spanish Armada. 
Nor did weather help the colony. Between 1587 and 1589, the worst 
drought in the area in 800 years struck. If the experience of later colonies 
is any guide, drought increased tensions with nearby American Indians who 
became much more reluctant to provide food when they faced their own shortages.

he found the colony abandoned. Whether the colonists were massacred or simply 
melted into the surrounding Indian tribes is unknown. 
2.5 Quick Review How did Francis Drake contribute to English wealth and power without 
establishing any colonies? Why were the English slower to establish colonies in the 
Americas than the Spanish or the French? 
CONCLUSION 
Through most of the 1500s, Cabrillo’s, De Soto’s, and Coronado’s expeditions for 
Spain; Verrazano’s and Cartier’s voyages for France; and Raleigh’s colonizing eff orts for 
England were considered total failures. Fortunes had been spent, but few permanent 
settlements had been made. Th e explorers had found no gold and no quick route to 
China in the lands north of Mexico. Nevertheless, Spain, France, and England now 
had a much clearer picture of the geography of North America. Many of the native 
peoples of North America also had at least a vague knowledge of the militaristic 
Europeans whose presence would change everything for future generations. Half a 
century aft er Columbus had fi rst landed, the Atlantic and Pacifi c coasts and most of 
the southern half of the United States had been the scene of many contacts between 
American Indians, Europeans, and often Africans. Even more than 100 years after 
Columbus, settlement was limited to a few Spanish posts in Florida and New Mexico. 
For the American Indians, Europeans were people who came quickly and left almost as 
quickly. While disease decimated some tribes, for most of the surviving native peoples 
of North America, daily life in the early 1550s, even in 1600, was barely diff erent from 
what it had been a century before. Th ey might have a few new trade goods or may have 
engaged in an occasional skirmish with Europeans, but that was about it. Th at situation 
would change quickly aft er 1600, however, as three great European powers, Spain, 
France, and England—and smaller ones including the Netherlands and Sweden— 
would establish permanent settlements and vie for control of North America.

COLUMBUS, THE COLUMBIAN EXCHANGE, AND EARLY 
CONQUESTS 
2.1 
Explain the reasons behind the voyages of Columbus, and 
describe early Spanish encounters with the peoples of the 
Caribbean, Mexico, and South America. 
Summary 
Columbus’s voyages to the Americas represented the beginning 
of an extraordinary change in worldwide human contact. 
Building on Columbus’s exploits, Spain was the unquestioned 
leader in the early exploration and conquest of the Americas. 
Because of disease and warfare, Spanish exploration and conquest 
of the Americas decimated the native peoples with whom 
they came in contact and touched off two related revolutions: a 
shift to an ocean-focused world trade system and the exchange 
of disease, plants, animals, and human culture between the 
New and Old Worlds. Within decades of Columbus’s arrival in 
the New World, the two most important Indian empires, the 
Aztecs and the Incas, had succumbed to disease and Spanish 
aggression, and before long other American tribes would suffer 
the same fate, if not from the Spanish then from another 
European power. For the fi rst 100 years aft er Columbus, little 
permanent European settlement took place north of Mexico, 
but Spanish, French, and English explorers mapped the coastlands 
and much of the interior of the future United States and 
Canada while they mostly sought a sea route around it. By 1600, 
however, enough was known about North America that future 
settlement came quickly.

A DIVIDED EUROPE: THE IMPACT OF THE PROTESTANT 
REFORMATION 
2.2 
Explain how the Protestant Reformation and the development 
of the nation-state changed Europe and European ideas about 
how best to settle and govern America. 
Summary 
The Protestant Reformation changed the way Europeans 
thought about the world, whether they were Protestant or 
Catholic. The religious divide produced by the Reformation 
would have a profound impact on the European expansion and 
settlement in the Americas. Martin Luther’s protests sparked 
the Reformation. Luther and John Calvin developed the most 
important religious ideas of Protestantism. The idea of the 
nation-state developed at the same time as the Protestant– 
Catholic split, and a new sense of the relationship between 
national and religious identity emerged. In a divided Europe, 
diff erent nations battled with each other to control both new 
lands in the Americas and old lands in Europe. Th e wars and 
divisions in Europe led many to seek asylum in the New World 
of the Americas, as far away from the old one as possible.

Summary 
Although less appealing to Spanish adventurers than Mexico 
and South America, North America attracted its share of wouldbe 
conquerors and colonists. Juan Ponce de León led the first 
official European expeditions to Puerto Rico and Florida. In 
1528, Pánfi lo de Narváez led another ill-fated eff ort to colonize 
Florida. The tales brought back by survivors of that expedition 
inspired Spanish exploration of the Southwest in search of 
fabled cities of enormous wealth, including an expedition led by

Francisco Vazquez de Coronado. While Coronado was roaming 
the Southwest, Hernando de Soto was exploring the Mississippi 
River Valley. A third expedition led by Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo 
investigated the Pacifi c Coast of California. Aft er all these failed 
or fruitless eff orts, Spanish interest in the lands north of Mexico 
waned. Only when other European powers showed an interest 
in North America did Spain set up permanent settlements 
there. When French Protestants attempted to settle in Florida, 
the Spanish countered by killing them and creating the city of 
St. Augustine. Later, Spanish eff orts to establish New Mexico were 
fueled by fears of English exploration along the Pacifi c coast. 
Review Questions 
5. Contextualization 
Why did the French try to colonize Florida? Why did the 
Spanish respond to these eff orts as they did? 
6. Historical Interpretation

De Soto, Coronado, and Cabrillo expeditions? Why did 
Spanish authorities remain uninterested in the future 
United States for so long?

EXPLORATION AND ENCOUNTER IN NORTH AMERICA: 
THE FRENCH 
2.4 
Analyze early French exploration and claims in North America. 
Summary 
French interest in North America focused on the St. Lawrence 
River Valley and what became Canada as well as on islands in 
the Caribbean. In 1524, King Francis I of France commissioned 
Giovanni da Verrazano to explore the Atlantic coast and fi nd a 
sea route to Asia for France. Verrazano was the fi rst European to 
sail into New York Harbor, and he mapped much of the Atlantic 
Coast of the future United States, but he found no route to 
Asia. In 1534, France tried again to fi nd a sea route to Asia, this 
time launching another unsuccessful expedition led by Jacques 
Cartier. On a second voyage in 1535–1536, Cartier explored the 
St. Lawrence River. Although Cartier’s travels would be the basis 
for future French land claims, it would be another half century 
before the French developed a serious interest in North America. 
Review Question 
8. Comparison 
Compare French lack of interest in a permanent settlement 
in the northern parts of the future United States and 
Canada in the 1500s with French and Spanish interest in settlement 
in Florida. How do you account for the diff erences?

reasons behind the Cartier and Verrazano expeditions and 
how they differed from French interest in settling Fort 
Caroline in 1562. 
EXPLORATION AND ENCOUNTER IN NORTH AMERICA: 
THE ENGLISH 
2.5 
Explain English explorers, privateers, and reasons for 
settlement. 
Summary 
Sixteenth-century English exploration and settlement in North 
America was shaped by England’s break with the Catholic 
Church. King Henry VIII’s desire to secure the annulment of 
his marriage to Catherine of Aragon led him to renounce papal 
authority. Under Henry’s successor, Edward VI, the English 
church became more Protestant in its beliefs and rituals. When 
Catherine’s daughter Mary I came to the English throne, she 
returned the country to Catholicism. Her successor Elizabeth I 
reestablished Protestantism and sought religious consensus. 
During Elizabeth’s long reign, England became a major 
Protestant power in Europe and the world. Conflict between 
England and Spain brought English adventurers and privateers 
to the Americas, the most famous of whom was Francis Drake. 
Walter Raleigh sponsored two failed attempts to establish 
English settlements in North America. 
Review Questions

Questions 1.1–1.3 refer to the following excerpt. 
Th e men were sent out to the mines as far as eighty leagues 
away while their wives remained to work the soil, not with hoes 
or plowshares drawn by oxen, but with their own sweat and 
sharpened poles that were far from equaling the equipment used 
for similar work in Castile. Th ey had to make silo-like heaps 
for cassava plants, by digging 12 square feet 4 palms deep and 
10,000 or 12,000 of such hills—a giant’s work—next to one

magnitude of whatever nature the Spaniards saw as fi ttest to 
make more money. Th us husbands and wives were together only 
once every eight or ten months and when they met they were so 
exhausted and depressed on both sides that they had no mind for 
marital communication and in this way they ceased to procreate. 
As for the newly born, they died early because their mothers, 
overworked and famished, had no milk to nurse them, and for 
this reason, while I was in Cuba, 7,000 children died in three 
months. Some mothers even drowned their babies from sheer 
desperation, while others caused themselves to abort with certain 
herbs that produced stillborn children. In this way husbands died 
in the mines, wives died at work, and children died from lack of 
milk, while others had not time or energy for procreation, and in 
a short time this land which was so great, so powerful and fertile, 
though so unfortunate, was depopulated. If this concatenation 
of events had occurred all over the world, the human race would 
have been wiped out in no time.

Questions 1.10–1.12 refer to the following excerpt. 
What exactly is the Spanish legacy? What is the 
Spanish imprint on the United States? 
Th e period from Columbus’s fi rst landfall in 1492 to 1607, 
when the English made their settlement at Jamestown, has 
traditionally been a blank spot in American history books. 
Some texts state quite plainly that the history of the United 
States begins in 1607, making only the most cursory mention 
of the sixteenth century—the century when, in the words of the 
historian Bernard Bailyn, Spain created “the largest and most 
populous empire the western world had seen since the fall of 
Rome.” Th e historian Howard Mumford Jones also compared 
Spain’s sixteenth-century achievements to those of antiquity: 
“Th e Spaniards invented a system of colonial administration 
unparalleled since the days of ancient Rome; in religion they 
launched the most sweeping missionary movement since the 
Germanic tribes accepted Christianity. . . . As for culture, 
the Spaniards transplanted dynamic forms of Renaissance 
art, thought, and institutions to the Americas with amazing 
quickness.” Th e Spanish established a college for the sons of 
Indian chiefs, in Mexico in 1536. . . . Spaniards set up the fi rst 
printing press in the New World in 1539, and, as Jones observed, 
“When in 1585 a forlorn little band of Englishmen were trying 
to stick it out on Roanoke Island, three hundred poets were 
competing for a prize in Mexico City.”

For well over 100 years aft er Columbus, Europeans spent more time 
trying to get around or through North America to reach Asia than 
they spent paying attention to the lands that would become the 
United States or Canada. Spain’s vast American empire was based in Mexico 
and Peru. Th e Spanish found Mexico, Central and South America, and the 
Caribbean more rewarding than they did North America, which lacked gold 
or silver and which they considered barren and icy. 
For decades, most European contact with North America was limited to 
fi lling the enormous European demand for codfi sh. Fishermen from France, 
England, and the Basque regions of Spain spent summers off the coast 
of Canada and Maine. Th ey set up temporary stations in Newfoundland, 
repaired their boats, and dried their fi sh. Few stayed the winter, and no permanent 
colonies were founded. Th e Native Americans found the fi shermen 
intrusive. The fishermen resented that the Indians’ plundered stores left 
behind over the winter. But most of the time, both sides simply avoided each 
other. Nevertheless, occasional contact was all it took to begin the spread of 
European diseases among the tribes of North America, well in advance of 
more sustained settlement. 
By the late 1500s, however, some in England and France as well as Spain 
were developing new interests in North America. In 1585, Richard Hakluyt 
the elder wrote Pamphlet for the Virginia Enterprise in an eff ort to convince

his countrymen that a settlement, or planting as he called it, was in their interests. He 
recognized that the native peoples might not welcome the English, but he said: 
We may, if we will proceed with extremity, conquer, fortify, and plant in soils 
most sweet, most pleasant, most strong, and most fertile, and in the end bring 
them all in subjection and to civility. 
For Hakluyt, subjection and conversion of the Native Americans to Protestant 
Christianity meant a rich profit and a military base for England against Catholic 
Spain. Others agreed, including King James I, who succeeded Elizabeth I in 1603. 
With the settlement of Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607, the English came to America 
to stay. Only 1 year later, France established a permanent settlement at Quebec on 
the Saint Lawrence River. In 1610, Spanish authorities also moved to a new permanent 
capital for their vast New Mexico territory that they named Santa Fe. Spain may 
have been fi rst, but England and France were not far behind in establishing North 
American colonies. 
From the settlements of Jamestown and Quebec, England and France claimed huge 
tracts of lands that they would eventually come to dominate. Th e English expanded 
from tiny Jamestown to control most of the Atlantic coast north of Florida and west 
toward the Allegheny Mountains. From Quebec, the French built trade and military 
centers all along the Saint Lawrence River and down the Mississippi to New Orleans 
on the Gulf of Mexico, a vast region they called New France. Aft er 1610, the Spanish 
expanded their settlements in New Mexico, though Florida was generally ignored. 
In the 1500s, explorers had come and quickly departed from North America. In 
the 1600s, the Europeans began to stay. Initially some Indian tribes saw Europeans 
as welcome trading partners or military allies against other tribes. Especially in 
the later 1600s when settlements grew too quickly, disease spread too rapidly, or 
the Europeans became too demanding, Indian resistance stiff ened. Th e story of the 
growth of European communities in North America and the responses by American 
Indian tribes—sometimes friendly trade and sometimes open warfare—is the heart 
of this chapter. 
THE ENGLISH SETTLE IN NORTH AMERICA 
Explain why the English began to settle in North America and how slavery was introduced 
in the English colonies. 
When James I became king of England in 1603, he was anxious to make peace with 
Spain. He quickly ended the royal support for legalized piracy that Queen Elizabeth 
I had provided—though piracy itself fl ourished throughout the 1600s. But many in 
England wanted a larger role in the Americas. If they were not going to steal America’s 
wealth from the Spanish on the seas, then they would need to fi nd other ways to gain 
it. Investors seeking fi nancial gain created the Virginia Company. Th ey told those they 
sent to America “to try if they can fi nd any mineral,” and to seek “passage to the Other 
Sea,” the longed-for shortcut to China. Th e investors also advised them to build settlements 
at some distance from the coast to avoid a Spanish attack and to gain as much 
knowledge and food from the Indians as possible “before that they perceive you mean 
to plant among them.” Within about 30 years, England had settled or claimed large territories, 
and their claims continued to expand into the 1700s (see Map 3-1 ). 
Colonizing Virginia: Jamestown 
In 1607, 105 men from the Virginia Company arrived in North America. Th ey named 
their new community Jamestown in honor of King James. Th e company appointed a 
council of six to govern the colony and left it to the council to elect its own president. 
But things in Jamestown did not go well.

Th e unhealthy conditions at the site the colonists selected along 
the James River probably killed more of them than any other cause. 
Although they thought they had selected “a very fi t place,” they had 
in fact chosen land with a terrible water supply. Th e water from the 
James River was tidal. At high tide, it was salt water. At low tide, it 
was “full of slime and fi lth.” Th e years 1607 and 1608 were drought 
years leading to a severe shortage of food. Th e winter of 1607–08 
was extremely cold. The Indians were suffering from the same 
drought and cold and were reluctant to trade food with the colonists. 
Waterborne disease and starvation weakened bodies, and few 
of the English escaped terrible bouts of sickness. 
Th e members of the council constantly disagreed—they ended 
up executing one of the councilors as a Spanish spy—and the rest of 
the colonists fought each other bitterly. Although the colony’s primary 
purpose was to enrich investors in London, those who were 
actually in Virginia found little reason to care whether the investors 
were enriched or not. England seemed far away. John Smith, 
the only member of the council not from the British nobility, complained, 
“Much they blamed us for not converting the Savages, 
when those [colonists] they sent us were little better if not worse.” 
By 1608, only 38 of the 105 colonists were still alive. 
Th e founders of Jamestown faced a diff erent situation from what 
Columbus had encountered in 1492 when the Indians of Hispaniola 
gasped in awe at the ships, swords, and men with beards. By 1607, 
generations of Atlantic Coast Indians had substantial experience 
with Europeans. Th ey had seen their ships, traded with them, and 
fought them. Some had even traveled to Europe and brought back 
reports of how these white adventurers lived. Europeans who were 
shipwrecked or from failed colonies—perhaps even from Roanoke— 
had melded into the Indian tribes and shared their knowledge with 
them. Th e Spanish at St. Augustine had tried to establish a northern 
outpost in the region. Th e Indians’ opinion of Europeans was not 
favorable. For the Paspahegh tribe, on whose land Jamestown was built, the English 
were trespassing. And relationships between Jamestown and all of the local Indians, a 
confederation of Algonquian-speaking tribes of 13,000 to 15,000 people, were tense. 
During its fi rst weeks, the colony was attacked, and only aft er that did the settlers 
build a stockade. Th e English came to understand that the Paspahegh and some 30 
other nearby tribes were under the rule of an overlord they called Powhatan whom the 
English described as functioning something like an emperor over the tribal chiefs. If 
the colonists wanted to make a lasting accommodation, it needed to be with him. 
By his own account—his autobiography, The True Travels, Adventures, and 
Observations of Captaine John Smith , published in 1630—John Smith saved the colony. 
Smith was an experienced soldier who had fought in Austria against the Muslim 
Turks, had been captured and sold into slavery in Istanbul, escaped, and had made his 
way through Russia, Germany, and North Africa before coming home to England. He 
brought all of this experience to Virginia. 
Early in his Virginia career, Smith had one of the most famous Indian encounters in 
American history. During the early months of the settlement, while Powhatan was trying to 
understand what these Englishmen wanted, Smith was exploring the countryside. He was 
taken prisoner by the Algonquians and brought before Powhatan. In Smith’s telling, he was 
about to be executed—he was laid on the ground with his head on a rock, and men with 
clubs stood around him. Th en Powhatan’s daughter, Pocahontas, already known to Smith 
for her work as a negotiator with Jamestown, suddenly “got his head in her armes, and 
laid her owne upon his to save him from death.” Powhatan granted Smith a reprieve. Most 
historians now believe that Powhatan scripted the whole event. Aft er his rescue, Powhatan

Florida began as very small settlements close to the coast and then spread 
into the interior. New Sweden became the core of Delaware, while New 
Netherland, stretching along the Hudson River later became the core of 
both New York and New Jersey. Massachusetts Bay and Plymouth were 
separate colonies until merged with Massachusetts in 1686.

told Smith that “now they were friends” and gave him an Algonquian name. 
Far from being executed, Smith had been adopted. Perhaps Powhatan 
aimed to make Smith one of the many chiefs who reported to him. 
Smith did not accept Powhatan’s offer of a place within the 
Algonquian confederation though he did not formally reject it either. 
Th e English off ered Powhatan an English crown that would symbolize 
his place in a world ruled by King James. Each side was jockeying for 
signs of submission from the other. In the early years, Powhatan could 
easily have destroyed Jamestown either by a direct attack or simply by 
withholding food. Instead, the Powhatan confederation fed the English 
and saw benefi t in trading with them. Th e English brought valuable new 
goods. Powhatan meant to use the English to strengthen his position 
against other tribes. Th e English avoided war and starvation and survived 
only by making an alliance with Powhatan. 
Smith’s success in dealing with Powhatan was only part of his contribution 
to the colony. Aft er he became governor in 1608, he instituted 
a policy that “he who does not work, does not eat.” In a tiny colony, far 
from home, there could be no leisure class and no slackers. To survive, 
the colony needed the back-breaking labor of farming and stockade 
building. Smith set everyone to it. Jamestown would have gone the way 
of Roanoke or other failed ventures without his leadership. 
But Smith returned to England in1609. As a result, he was not in 
Jamestown for the “starving time” of the winter of 1609–10 when the 
colony was almost wiped out by starvation and disease. Realizing that 
the peaceful trade he hoped for was not materializing. Powhatan withdrew 
from contact with the Europeans. Consequently, the English could 
not rely on the Indians for food. The English attacked the Indians, 
burned their houses, plundered their sacred sites, and stole their valuables. 
But the English could not eat the valuables, and another party 
seeking food was found dead with their mouths stuff ed with bread by the Indians. 
In the spring of 1610, the surviving colonists decided to abandon Jamestown. Th ey 
burned the town and sailed down the James River. However, before they reached the sea, 
they were met by an English fl eet with 400 men led by the newly appointed governor, Lord 
de la Warr, and enough supplies to last a year. Th e colony was rebuilt where it had been. 
While the colonists in Virginia had been starving, the Virginia Company in 
London had reorganized itself and sold stock to raise funds. It also enlisted clergy 
across England to preach on the importance of colonizing Virginia. Th e venture was 
no longer described as a way to acquire quick riches but as a kind of national mission. 
It was England’s duty, the ministers said, to send missionaries and build a permanent 
Protestant base in the Americas that would convert Indians and serve England in 
future confrontations with Spain. 
Jamestown survived. But for another decade, life remained precarious. Th ousands of 
colonists arrived in Virginia, having fl ed England aft er being thrown off their land, but 
disease and limited food decimated their numbers. A new economic foundation for the 
colony’s survival had to be found if Jamestown was to be of use. Aft er a decade of investing 
in Jamestown, its backers in London were frustrated. No route to China had been found, 
and there were no precious metals in the colony. Farming kept the colonists alive but 
returned little to the investors, and there was confl ict, not lucrative trade, with the Indians. 
Th at something new turned out to be a product that Columbus had discovered— 
tobacco. Before 1492, no Europeans knew anything about tobacco, though the peoples 
of North and South America had used it for medicinal and religious purposes for hundreds 
of years. But Columbus took some tobacco leaves with him on his fi rst return 
voyage. Within a few decades, smoking tobacco became popular in Europe. Spaniards 
smoked tobacco from Cuba. King James, who found smoking tobacco “loathsome to the 
eye, hateful to the nose, harmful to the brain, dangerous to the lungs,” also saw in it a 
Pocahontas gained fame fi rst as the young woman who rescued 
Virginia’s leader, John Smith, and later as the wife of tobacco planter, 
John Rolfe. She is shown here as she was seen in London, as Rebecca 
Rolfe, the fi rst Native American to be seen by many in England.

way to make signifi cant profi ts and created a royal monopoly. And Virginia, its settlers 
discovered, had the ideal climate and conditions for producing tobacco. Th e settlers 
might have preferred to fi nd silver or gold, but tobacco quickly became valuable. 
In 1622, led by Openchancanough, Powhatan’s brother and the tribe’s new 
leader, the Algonquians attacked and killed some 300 of the 1,200 English settlers. 
Th e Indians had lost patience with the continual encroachment of the English and the 
lack of trade or other benefi ts. Attacks continued for more than a decade. Th e confl ict 
eventually bankrupted the Virginia Company, but in 1624, Virginia had been converted 
to a royal colony by the king, so eff orts to settle the area continued. 
Th e shift from trade with Indians to tobacco-based agriculture in the 1620s sealed 
the fate of the Indians who had been essential to the colony’s early survival. Indian 
land became more valuable to the English than the Indians themselves, and disease 
was decimating Indian populations. Th e new emphasis on agriculture also meant that 
many from England would settle and farm the land. Th e shift also changed the lives of 
thousands of Africans who were brought to the Americas as slaves to produce the new 
crops. Tobacco was a key factor in reshaping who would be a part of this new Englishspeaking 
nation and the role they would play in the society that emerged. 
The Massachusetts Colonies: Plymouth, Boston, and Beyond 
During the fi rst two decades of the 1600s, many in England were coming to see the 
country as overpopulated. Changes in agriculture were forcing people out of subsistence 
farming and into cities. England’s economy was stagnating. What better outlet for excess 
population than the new colonies across the ocean? It was a great service, some argued, 
to ship the poor to do the agricultural work that was so badly needed across the sea. 
King James especially wanted to see one group on its way across the ocean—the 
Protestant extremists who were forever agitating for more change within the Church 
of England (also known as the Anglican or Episcopal Church).

Protestants who wanted a more complete Reformation than the Church of England 
represented came to be known as Puritans. When Henry VIII and his successors had 
broken with the pope, they maintained a religious liturgy much like the Catholic Mass 
and a church governed by bishops. Queen Elizabeth I had sought religious peace by tolerating 
diff erences in viewpoints as long as people accepted her religious authority and 
agreed to use the form of worship prescribed in the Book of Common Prayer . But the 
Puritans wanted change—much more change. Th ey believed that the offi ce of bishop 
had no base in the Bible and that each individual congregation should be self-governing. 
Th ey believed each individual was responsible for reading and understanding the Bible. 
Th ose who opposed the Church of England’s demands for religious uniformity also 
had major diff erences among themselves. Some believed it was their duty to stay within 
the Anglican Church and work for change. Others thought that change could come 
only from leaving the established church. Th e former tried to “purify” the Church of 
England and were known as Puritans. Th e latter group, called Separatists, thought that 
the church was hopelessly corrupt and that they needed to form their own separate 
religious communities. Th e Separatists were constantly in trouble with the authorities 
since everyone in England was expected to belong to the Anglican Church and attend 
its worship every Sunday. To separate oneself from the church, to worship in a place 
or form not authorized by the church, was treason. No wonder King James wanted to 
“harry them out of the land,” and that so many of the Separatists wanted to leave. 
Separatists, also known as Pilgrims , founded the second permanent English colony 
in North America at Plymouth, Massachusetts, in 1620. The origins of Plymouth 
colony lay in a small community of Separatists who left England for Holland in 1607 
where they were welcomed along with other English religious dissenters. 
But the Separatists still considered themselves English, and they worried about 
raising children in Holland who would become more Dutch than English. Eventually, 
they decided that English North America would be a happier place for them. In 1619, 
these Separatist Pilgrims secured a grant of land from the Virginia Company, got 
fi nancial backing from investors, and hired a ship. Aft er many delays, the Mayfl ower 
sailed from Plymouth, England, on September 6, 1620, with 102 passengers. Half the 
passengers were members of the congregation. Th e others were “strangers” along for 
adventure or profi t. As William Bradford, who became Plymouth’s historian, wrote of 
this congregation, “they knew they were pilgrims.” 
Aft er a stormy 2-month voyage, they reached land far north of where they meant 
to go. Realizing that they were outside of the Virginia territory and that their new 
community was split between its religious members and others, they promised to 
“combine ourselves together into a civil body politic, for our better ordering and preservation.” 
Future generations would see the Mayfl ower Compact as the beginning 
of government by the consent of the people. But historians have seen it as something 
more modest: an agreement among a diverse group of people to try to get along with 
each other through what they knew would be a hard winter in a strange land. 
The Pilgrims’ first landing in November 1620 was on the outer end of Cape 
Cod at what is now Provincetown, Massachusetts. By December, however, they 
had moved across Cape Cod Bay to a place they named Plymouth where a high hill 
offered protection, and a large level area leading down to the harbor was a good 
place to build a town. Plymouth was empty when the Pilgrims landed. As recently as 
1616, 1,000 or more Indians had lived around Plymouth, but an epidemic had wiped 
them out. As had happened elsewhere in the Americas, disease traveled faster than 
people. Enough European fi shermen and traders had been traveling along the coast 
to ensure a plentiful supply of microbes. Th e new community quickly built on the 
now empty land. 
Th e Pilgrims had arrived too late to build the kind of shelter they needed for a New 
England winter. During the winter of 1620–21, about half the community died from 
disease, cold, and malnutrition. Some families were wiped out altogether. Th ey had no 
contact with Native Americans, but they knew they were being watched constantly.

Th en, in spring 1621, their luck changed. An Indian walked “very boldly” into the 
heart of the small Plymouth community. And when he arrived, to their utter amazement, 
he said, “Welcome, Englishmen!” Th e visitor was Samoset, a native of what is 
now Maine, where English fi shermen had been landing for a century, hence his knowledge 
of the language. More important, he had been asked to visit them by Massasoit, 
the ruler of the Wampanoag Indians of the area. Massasoit was also familiar with 
English ships that had sailed along the coast and had sent exploring parties ashore. He 
was now ready to make contact. 
Soon aft er Samoset’s visit, Massasoit himself arrived with many warriors and a 
translator named Squanto who had been captured by previous English explorers and 
who had lived in London. He became a go-between for Massasoit with the Pilgrim 
community, even though neither side ever fully trusted him. 
Squanto surprised the Pilgrims when he described parts of London and, more 
important, when he taught them how to fi nd hibernating eels in nearby creeks. Th ey 
had their best meal in months that evening. He also taught them to catch herring in 
the town brook and use them as fertilizer for planting corn. It proved to be the salvation 
of the colony. Th e Pilgrims concluded an agreement with Massasoit that led to 54 
years of peace, an amazing development in the Americas. 
In the fall of 1621, with peace concluded and the fi rst successful harvest accomplished, 
Governor Bradford announced that it was time to “rejoice together” with the 
people who had helped, indeed allowed, them to survive. Th e fi rst Th anksgiving (the 
Pilgrims never actually used that word) was a weeklong time of feasting on the fruits 
of the harvest and on turkeys, ducks, geese, deer, and stews. Th e Pilgrims were recreating 
something they knew well, a traditional English harvest festival. Most of those 
present at “the fi rst Th anksgiving,” however, were Wampanoags, including Massasoit 
himself who brought gift s of freshly killed deer to the festivities. 
This modern recreation of the Pilgrim Village at Plimoth Plantation (note old style spelling) has been built 
using extensive original records from 1627—seven years after the colony’s founding when life had reached a 
bit of stability—on the site of the fi rst Pilgrim colony in Plymouth, Massachusetts.

Another group of religious dissidents from England were not far behind Plymouth’s 
Pilgrims. Puritan reformers who wanted to stay within the Church of England and 
change it were also having a hard time in the 1620s. King Charles I (r. 1625–1649) was 
extremely hostile to the Puritans . Advocating reform within the established church 
became more difficult and dangerous. The Puritans, however, were not without 
resources. A group of them controlled a corporation, the Massachusetts Bay Company, 
to explore and settle North America. It was similar to the Virginia Company except 
that Puritans led it. Th ey planted their fi rst colony in Salem, just north of present-day 
Boston in 1629, and soon wanted to expand. In late 1629, someone realized that wording 
in the charter would allow them to move the whole company—its charter and the 
control that went with it—out of England and into the colony that the Massachusetts 
Bay Company controlled. If successful, this move would create not only a self-governing 
Puritan company but also a company thousands of miles from the king and his 
bishops who were making things so diffi cult for Puritans in England. 
John Winthrop, an ardent Puritan, was invited to be the governor of the new colony. 
In spring 1630, 14 ships left England for Massachusetts Bay with their new governor 
and their charter on board. By the end of the summer, more than 1,000 people 
and 200 cattle had landed in the Massachusetts colony. In the next decade, known as 
the Great Migration, some 20,000 people followed. Th e Puritan Massachusetts Bay 
Colony soon had more people than Plymouth and Jamestown combined. 
Th e Massachusetts Puritans also had a clear sense of purpose. As Winthrop said: “Our 
immediate object is to seek out a new home under a due form of Government both civil 
and ecclesiasticall.…we shall be as a Citty upon a hill. Th e eyes of all people are upon Us.” 
Th e Puritan Commonwealth in New England could also be a new model for old England. 
Puritans 
A name given to those more extreme 
Protestants within the Church of England 
who wanted to stay in the church but “purify” 
it of what they saw as Roman Catholic ways. 
W illiam Bradford was one of the original Pilgrims. He wrote his 
classic book over a period of many years to inform an English 
audience—and English investors—of the state of the new colony 
or plantation. 
Being thus arrived in a good harbor and brought safe to land, 
they fell upon their knees and blessed the God of heaven, who 
had brought them over the vast and furious ocean, and delivered 
them from all the perils and miseries thereof again to set their 
feet on the firm and stable earth.… 
Being thus passed the vast ocean and a sea of troubles before 
in their preparation (as may be remembered by that which went 
before), they had now no friends to welcome them, nor inns to 
entertain or refresh their weatherbeaten bodies, nor houses or 
much less towns to repair to, to seek for succor.… 
And for the season it was winter, and they that know the winters 
of that country know them to be sharp and violent and subject to 
cruel and fierce storms….Besides, what could they see but a hideous 
and desolate wilderness, full of wild beasts and wild men, 
and what multitudes there might be of them they knew not.… 
But that which was most sad and lamentable was that in two or 
three months’ time half of their company died…being infected with 
the scurvy and other diseases, which this long voyage…had brought 
upon them; so there died sometimes two or three of a day in the 
aforesaid time, that of 100 and odd persons scarce fifty remained.… 
The spring now approaching, it pleased God the mortality 
began to cease amongst them, and the sick and lame recovered….
Afterwards they…began to plan their corn, in which service 
Squanto stood them in great stead, showing them both… 
how to set it, and after how to dress and tend it…and where to 
get other provisions necessary for them, all which they found 
true by trial and experience.… 
They began now to gather in the small harvest they had, and 
to fit up their houses and dwellings against winter, being well 
recovered in health and strength, and had all things good plenty.

The Pilgrims had written their Mayflower Compact as a simple basis for the 
colony’s government. Th e Puritan migrants of 1630 meant to use the more detailed 
Charter of the Massachusetts Bay Company to organize a permanent self-governing 
colony in Massachusetts. 
Th e fi rst meeting of the Great and General Court—the colony’s governing body— 
on New England soil took place in August 1630. What had started as a business 
venture in England was transformed into a government in Massachusetts. Annual 
elections chose the governor, deputy-governor, and members of the General Court 
(as the state legislature in Massachusetts is still called). Only church members in good 
standing could vote. This settlement was designed to be a model religious colony. 
When King Charles I realized what the Puritans had done, he sent a ship to recover 
the charter. Governor Winthrop called out the Puritan militia and mounted cannons 
at the entrance to Boston harbor. Th ose under royal command who had come for the 
charter decided that it would be wiser to sail back to England without it. 
Th e Puritans valued literacy. If salvation depended on a personal encounter with the 
Christian faith, then Puritans needed to be able to read the Bible and have ministers and 
magistrates who were highly literate. In 1636, only 6 years aft er Boston was founded, the 
colony’s legislature ordered the creation of a college that would soon be named Harvard 
for an early benefactor. Th ey created Boston Latin School to prepare young men for college, 
and in 1647, the legislature required every township in the colony to provide for a 
school. Towns found ways to evade the law, but literacy was still high in Massachusetts. 
Th e Puritans of Massachusetts Bay, however, had their diff erences with one another. 
Several splits occurred during the fi rst decade of the colony. In 1637, Puritans on the 
Connecticut River found the government in Boston too restrictive and created their own 
independent colony of Connecticut based at Hartford. Two years later, with permission 
from the authorities in Boston, the Hartford colonists established a formal government 
for their colony known as the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut . Th e document 
off ered more men the right to vote than did the rules then in force in Massachusetts 
Bay. Some have considered it as the fi rst written constitution in the Americas, 
though others, looking at the Massachusetts charter and other such documents, 
dispute that claim. Other Puritans found the Boston government not strict 
enough and created a more theocratic colony at New Haven the following year. 
More troublesome to the Puritans was Roger Williams, whose advocacy of 
freedom of conscience for every individual was almost unique in the 1600s. 
Williams was a supporter of the Puritan cause in England and arrived in 
Boston in 1631 only a year aft er the city’s founding. But he quickly got into 
trouble with Boston’s magistrates because he asserted that civil authority could 
not enforce religious laws, including a law against blasphemy. In 1635, he was 
convicted of “ erroneous” opinions. In the winter of 1636, he walked from 
his old home in Salem, Massachusetts, to the top of Narragansett Bay (more 
than 65 miles) and soon established a new colony called Providence where he 
invited all those “distressed of conscience” to the fi rst colony that would separate 
church and state and grant full liberty to people of any religious opinion, a 
direct slap at Puritan eff orts at religious uniformity. Williams established close 
working relationships with both the Wampanoag and Narragansett tribes— 
and insisted on paying them for the land on which he established his colony, 
unlike the settlers of Boston or Plymouth. Under Williams’ leadership Rhode 
Island became a haven for religious dissenters. 
In addition, Anne Hutchinson caused a stir with her charismatic preaching 
and her belief that God’s inspiration could be more immediate than most 
Puritans believed. While Puritans insisted that every man and woman should 
read and interpret the Bible, they expected the interpretation to follow certain 
paths. In addition, only men were supposed to preach. When Hutchinson said 
that she herself received direct revelations from God, she had moved beyond

corporation that launched Massachusetts

authorities allowed a new separate colony

considerable diffi culties for the authorities who ruled in

what the Puritans would tolerate and was banished from the colony. She and her followers 
made their way, fi rst to Roger Williams’s colony in Rhode Island, and then to 
Dutch New Amsterdam where she was killed in an Indian attack in 1643. 
While the fi rst generation of New England’s founders argued about whose version 
of Protestant theology was correct, their American-born children and grandchildren 
sometimes wandered quite far from the theological interests of the founders. Th e fi rst 
Massachusetts Puritans saw themselves as being on an “errand into the wilderness,” 
as a 1670 sermon put it. Religious fervor and conversions were less common in the 
next generations. 
In Massachusetts in the 1600s, only those who could convincingly demonstrate that 
they had a true religious conversion could be church members, and only church members 
could vote. Since one had to convince a congregation that he or she had truly been 
converted to become a church member, many, including the children of devout church 
members, could not qualify for either church membership or the right to vote. People 
who were excluded from these privileges did not make for happy colonial residents. 
In 1662, Massachusetts clergy adopted the Halfway Covenant , which allowed 
adults who had been baptized as children, because their parents were church members, 
to have their own children baptized, even if they were not among the members of 
a congregation. The compromise was a significant one for a community in which 
church membership was central to all else. In time, that compromise also led to many 
Massachusetts churches allowing any who could demonstrate familiarity with Christian 
doctrine and led a good life to be church members—and therefore also voters. 
Maryland 
Aft er Virginia and the New England colonies, the next English colony to be established 
on the mainland of North America was Maryland. Earlier colonies had been founded 
by corporations or were royal colonies ruled by governors appointed by the king. 
Maryland represented something new, a proprietary colony. A proprietary colony —of 
which Maryland was the model—was essentially owned by one person and heirs who 
were, as the Maryland charter said, “true and absolute lords and proprietaries.” Th e 
proprietor might allow others to own land and might take advice from local offi cials, 
but the whole colony was private property and, as such, could be passed from generation 
to generation within the proprietor’s family. King Charles I established this model 
when he off ered to give Maryland to George Calvert, the fi rst Lord Baltimore. 
Maryland was also diff erent in another way. Lord Baltimore was a devout Catholic, 
and Catholics were persecuted in England. But King Charles was sympathetic despite 
popular opposition. Lord Baltimore, with the King’s support, was determined to establish 
Maryland as a haven for English Catholics. Aft er George Calvert died, his son, Cecil 
Calvert, the second Lord Baltimore, developed the colony. He realized that he had to 
recruit more people than a Catholic-only colony would attract. So, in 1649, Maryland 
granted freedom of worship to all Christians, including Protestants of any persuasion. 
While the proprietors retained fi nal authority in Maryland, they agreed in 1635, to 
call a representative assembly. Aft er initially establishing a colony of large estates, they 
also decided, following Virginia’s lead, to give every European settler 100 acres, another 
100 for each additional adult member of the family, and 50 acres for each child. Th is 
headright system —as it came to be called—made moving to Maryland very popular. 
From the beginning, Marylanders also knew that, as in Virginia, tobacco would be the 
key to their economic success. With tobacco came the need for more workers. Th us, 
African slavery came early to Maryland. In 1661, Maryland was the fi rst colony to formalize 
laws governing slavery. Th e laws included the stipulations that slaves inherited 
their status from their mother and that slavery for those born into it was for life.

that allowed adults who had been baptized 
because their parents were church members, 
but who had not yet experienced conversion, 
to have their own children baptized.

Additional Colonies: Continued Settlement and Development 
Th e fi rst English colonies of Jamestown and Plymouth on the North American mainland, 
were models for what came later. Plymouth and Boston learned from mistakes made 
at Jamestown. All of those who established later English colonies studied Jamestown, 
Plymouth, and Boston, borrowing what they liked and ignoring the rest. In addition, 
those colonies also studied the prosperous English colonies that were developing on the 
island of Bermuda and in the Caribbean. Th ose island colonies attracted their own settlers 
from England and brought far more slaves from Africa than did the mainland colonies. 
On the islands, slaves worked on the expanding sugar plantations. Table 3-1 shows all of 
the English colonies that were eventually established in North America and in the islands.

to be reshaped. Connecticut was united with New Haven in 1662. Massachusetts 
Bay Colony merged with Plymouth in 1685. New Hampshire became a separate colony 
under a royal governor in 1691. (Vermont did not separate from New York until aft er the 
American Revolution, and Maine was part of Massachusetts until 1820.) 
NEW YORK New York was settled before Maryland, but not by the English. It became 
English only aft er the English Civil War (1642–1649). What is now New York was settled 
by the Netherlands, or Holland, a new Protestant country carved out of what had been 
Spanish possessions in the late 1500s. Sailing for the Dutch, Henry Hudson had explored 
much of the Atlantic coast in 1609. His voyage gave the Netherlands the basis for its 
claim to land in North America. Th e Dutch West India Company was set up in 1621, 
and it built a Dutch trading post at Fort Orange (now Albany, New York) in 1624. Th e 
economic base of the Dutch colony was the fur trade. Th e Iroquois were happy to trade 
with the Dutch. Th ey benefi ted from fostering competition between Dutch and French 
traders to see who would off er the best price for furs and be the best military allies. 
In 1626, the Dutch built a settlement and commercial center called New Amsterdam 
on Manhattan Island, which, according to legend, was purchased from local Indians for 60 
Dutch guilders (calculated at approximately $24 by an historian in the 1840s, over $1,000 
today but still exceedingly cheap). Th ere is some debate about which tribe actually received 
any payment, though one was recorded in Holland. Th e payment, however, refl ected a 
European understanding of land ownership. Most Native American tribes did not think in 
terms of someone actually owning land; to them, the land, air, and water were open to all. 
Despite efforts by its long-time governor Peter Stuyvesant to enforce religious 
uniformity and ban Jews, New Amsterdam soon became a haven for religious dissenters 
including Jews, Catholics, Quakers, and Muslims. It was also home to Dutch, German, 
French, Swedish, Portuguese, and English settlers. Th e Dutch were active in the slave 
trade. New Amsterdam had the largest number of African slaves in North America in the 
1600s. As a trading center, New Amsterdam also saw many Native Americans who came 
to the city to sell furs and buy European goods. Successive Dutch governors banned sexual 
contact between the Dutch residents and Indians, but the ban was not always honored. 
While the heart of the Dutch colony remained on Manhattan Island, the Dutch 
authorities off ered large tracts of land to wealthy Dutch citizens, known as patroons , 
to develop the lands along the Hudson River between New Amsterdam and Albany. 
Wealthy Dutch investors who promised to settle at least 50 people on their land were 
given huge tracts of land, which they controlled as private fi efdoms. Nevertheless New 
Netherlands never had more than 10,000 European and African residents. 
In 1664, King Charles II gave New Amsterdam to his younger brother, the Duke 
of York (who later became King James II). Th at the Dutch already had a settlement 
on the land did not bother either brother. Having been “given” the colony, the duke 
sent a fl eet to New Amsterdam to take it. Th ere was little resistance to the English take 
over; Governor Peter Stuyvesant was unpopular, and the English promised to respect 
Dutch property. Th e Dutch briefl y recaptured the colony in 1673, but it returned to 
English rule permanently the following year. Th e heart of the Dutch oceanic empire 
was elsewhere. Th ey were not going to fi ght the English over this remote outpost. 
Th e Duke of York divided the colony, keeping New York for himself and giving New 
Jersey to two political allies. For the rest of the 1600s, New Jersey remained a colony of 
small farms of limited profi t to its proprietors, although it attracted a diverse group of 
European settlers because its proprietors off ered land at low prices and gave settlers significant 
religious and political freedom. But New York, with its great harbor and access to the 
interior via the Hudson River, quickly became one of the most valuable English colonies. 
PENNSYLVANIA AND DELAWARE The next English colony was Pennsylvania. Like 
Maryland, Pennsylvania was established as a proprietary colony and a haven for a 
persecuted religious group while being open to all. Pennsylvania’s proprietor was 
William Penn, the son of Sir William Penn, an admiral in the Royal Navy with close 
connections to King Charles II. Th e younger William Penn inherited the right to collect a 
patroons 
Dutch settlers who were given vast tracts of 
land along the Hudson River between New 
Amsterdam and Albany in return for bringing 
at least 50 immigrants to work the land.

substantial debt that the king owed to the Penn family. King Charles II repaid the debt in 
the form of land in North America. But while William Penn inherited both fortune and 
royal connections, unlike his admiral father, he was a member of a dissident religious 
community known as Quakers because they supposedly trembled—quaked—at the 
name of God. Quakers broke with much of the traditional theology and religious practice 
of the day. When they gathered for worship, Quakers sat in silence until someone 
was moved by the Spirit to speak. Th ey did not have formal clergy and gave women equal 
standing with men in their community, known as the Society of Friends. In addition, 
they were absolute pacifi sts who would not serve in the military. Because of their refusal 
to serve in the military and attend the services of the Church of England, they were constantly 
in legal trouble. Penn himself was briefl y jailed for following Quaker practices. 
Penn received his land grant from King Charles II in 1681, and the next year he sailed 
to Pennsylvania and founded Philadelphia (the City of Brotherly Love). Penn recruited 
settlers widely, in Britain and on the European continent, especially in Germany. By 
1700, 18,000 Europeans had arrived. In keeping with his Quaker beliefs, Penn insisted 
on peaceful trade with the Indians. Although he had been granted land from the king, 
Penn also paid the Indians for their land. During his lifetime, Pennsylvania was generally 
a peaceful place. Tribes from other colonies found a new home there. 
Despite all of his commitment to peace with the Indians, Penn did not outlaw 
slavery in his colony. As early as 1684, 2 years aft er its founding, 150 African slaves 
arrived in Philadelphia. Slaves quickly came to have a key role as household servants, 
and by the early 1700s, slaves made up one-sixth of the city’s population. In rural communities, 
slaves worked in iron furnaces, mines, tanneries, salt works, and on farms. 
Penn tried to create a prosperous colony based on high ideals. But he was also 
an aristocrat who held absolute power. By the 1690s, many in the colony, including 
Quakers who appreciated their religious freedom, demanded more political freedom. 
In 1701, Penn reluctantly agreed to a Charter of Liberties that established an elected 
legislature, though the legislature and the Penn family would continue to argue until 
the beginnings of the American Revolution. 
Th e 1701 charter also allowed the three most southern counties of Pennsylvania to 
create their own assembly, which became the core of the separate colony of Delaware. 
Th e fi rst Europeans to settle in Delaware were from Sweden and Finland, creating the 
small New Sweden colony at Fort Christina—today’s Wilmington, Delaware—in 1638. 
This map of New Amsterdam just at the time the English fi rst took control (note the English fl ag fl ying on the 
fort) shows the site of the fort at the tip of Manhattan and the British ships off shore.

Th e Dutch of New Amsterdam conquered the colony in 1655 before 
themselves being defeated by the English in 1664. The area was 
included in the land grant given to William Penn, but its separate 
history and geographical distance limited its relationship to the rest 
of Pennsylvania. 
CAROLINA South of Virginia, the land was contested between 
England and Spain, to say nothing of the Indian tribes who lived 
there. But England meant to claim the area. Soon aft er coming to 
the throne, Charles II rewarded eight of his supporters, and sought 
to secure England’s land claims by creating a colony named Carolina 
(based on the Latin for Charles ). The proprietors developed an 
elaborate system of government that prescribed a hierarchical society 
with themselves at the top followed by the local gentry, then 
poor white servants, with African slaves at the bottom. Th e city of 
Charles Town, later Charleston, became the colony’s capital. 
Carolina was a divided colony. In the north, most of the 
settlers were relatively poor white farmers from Virginia. Farther 
south, large-scale rice growing created a rich colony. Much of the 
colony’s commercial success focused on the city—and harbor— 
at Charleston and on trade with the British Caribbean colonies, 
especially Barbados. Many of the early immigrants were from Barbados, both wealthy 
Europeans who became the elite of the mainland colony and African slaves who did 
the actual work of the rice farming. Following the model of Barbados in the Caribbean, 
which depended on plantations to grow sugarcane, the southern part of Carolina 
became one of the earliest plantation economies on the mainland of North America. 
Th e split between the north and south was formalized when King George II offi cially 
divided the colony into North and South Carolina in 1729. 
G EORGIA T he last English colony that would later be part of the United States 
was Georgia, founded in 1733 for idealistic reasons. James Oglethorpe, a war hero 
in England, wanted to create a place where the poorest of England’s poor, those in 
debtor’s prisons because they could not repay what they owed, could fi nd new lives. 
Oglethorpe also believed that England needed a strong frontier colony on the border 
with Spanish Florida. Th ese settlers, people whose alternative might well be prison, 
would be inspired to be not only farmers but also soldiers within this frontier border. 
Given this focus, Oglethorpe excluded Catholics—who might be secretly loyal to 
Catholic Spain—and Africans, free or slave—since they might be tempted to run away. 
With Georgia, the 13 colonies that went on to unite in 1776 were in place. 
Africans and Indentured Servants in England’s Colonies 
In 1619, a Dutch ship arrived at Jamestown. John Rolfe, anxious to expand the workforce 
for his tobacco farm, traded food supplies to the Dutch in return for 20 African 
slaves. Rolfe’s 1619 purchase of other humans is usually given as the date for the beginning 
of slavery in what is now the United States. In fact, the Spanish had African slaves 
in Florida during the 1500s (see Chapter 2 ) . A census of Virginia in 1620 that did not 
count Indians listed 32 Africans—17 women and 15 men—out of a total population of 
982. Nevertheless, the exchange of American-grown foodstuff s for African people that 
took place in 1619 was signifi cant. Although it would have been impossible to predict

new nation that emerged from them. 
Th e slavery that existed in British North America in the early 1600s was profoundly 
diff erent from what slavery had been in the early 1500s or from what it became in the 
colonies in the early 1700s. Many think of slavery as a static institution, but the nature 
of slavery changed oft en. For many Americans, the image of slavery is that of the large

plantations that existed in the South between 1800 and the 1860s. But understanding 
the development of slavery in the United States requires more careful observation. 
Slavery, though always terrible, meant diff erent things at diff erent times. 
In the earliest years, slavery, though very diffi cult, was less harsh and hopeless than 
it became aft er about 1680. When John Rolfe purchased those 20 African slaves in 
1619, it was not clear what their status would be. Slavery had not been codifi ed either 
as a permanent life-long status or as something associated always with race. 
Th e fi rst generation of African slaves in Virginia oft en worked side by side not only 
with English and Irish servants—many of whom also had little choice about coming 
to America—but also with captured Indians. Race was always a factor, but racial lines 
were blurred. Servants and slaves lived together, created new families together, and 
resisted together when they felt ill-treated. 
In the small farms of the Chesapeake, in the Middle Colonies, and in New England, 
slaves also worked side by side with those who owned the land and with indentured 
servants who were working for a specifi ed number of years to pay off the cost of their 
travel to America. Some of these indentured servants came seeking a better life; others 
came as an alternative to prison in England. During a term of indenture, a servant 
was treated much like a slave. Indentured servants could be bought and sold and 
were oft en whipped. Th e diff erence between indentured servanthood and slavery, and 
it was significant, was that at the end of their term, ranging from 4 to 7 years, the 
servants were set free. Until the late 1640s the majority died before completing their 
term, and even aft er earning their freedom, most of the newly freed were not able to 
earn much, although a few prospered and joined the elite. Since an English indentured 
servant cost about half as much as an African slave, and since neither tended to 
live long, many Virginians initially preferred indentured servants. Servants and slaves 
oft en intermarried and saw themselves as a united group. 
Th e Africans, like the European servants, dreamed of a day when they might be free 
to own their own land. Th at dream was not an impossible one in the early 1600s. For 
example, Anthony Johnson was sold as a slave in Jamestown in 1621. He worked on 
the farm of the Bennett family and became known for his “hard labor and…service.” 
Aft er more than a decade of labor on the Bennett property, he was allowed to farm 
indentured servants 
An individual who contracted to serve for a 
period of 4 to 7 years in return for payment of 
passage to America. 
This early picture of a Virginia tobacco plantation shows the role of African slave labor in doing the work of 
the plantation, the English elite in managing the work, and the overriding presence of Indians in the image 
of the colony.

independently while still a slave. He married a woman named Mary. Th eir children 
were baptized with the blessings of the authorities. Eventually, he gained his freedom 
and changed his name. When the Bennetts moved to eastern Virginia, the Johnsons 
moved with them. By 1651, Anthony Johnson owned a 250-acre farm with his own 
servants and at least one slave. His son John owned 550 acres, and another son owned 
100 acres. Th e Johnson family, if not viewed as the equals of their white neighbors, 
were in many ways part of Virginia’s landed gentry. During the 1600s, the Johnsons 
were not the only former slaves to achieve this status. No slaves in Virginia, Maryland, 
or the Carolinas, however, could hope to repeat this success in the 1700s or 1800s. 
Th ere was more to the experience of the Johnsons than the freedom they gained to 
own and work their own land. Th ey were free to travel. Th ey were members of Christian 
churches and participated in the fi nancial and religious activities of the colony. Th e total 
number of Africans, slave and free, remained relatively small in Virginia before 1680. On 
the eastern shore where the Johnsons lived, there were some 40 free blacks out of a total 
black population of 300. While most Africans remained in slavery, 30 percent of the people 
of African descent in parts of Virginia were free in 1668. Race was not insignifi cant, 
but neither race as a marker of slavery nor slavery as an institution had been determined. 
Slavery developed in the northern colonies as it did in those further south, coming 
to Massachusetts fairly soon aft er it came to Virginia. By the 1660s, Boston’s elite lived 
in a slave-owning world. One-third of the slaves in Massachusetts lived in Boston. In 
the North, slavery was more urban than rural. In the cities, slaves worked as household 
servants, cooking, cleaning, sewing, tending gardens and stables, and running errands. 
Th ey also worked on wagons and wharves. Northern slaves, like many southern slaves 
of the 1600s, were much more fully integrated into European-American society, had 
less contact with fellow Africans and African traditions, and had much more freedom 
than later generations of slaves.

Quick Review Compare the reasons for founding the different English colonies in 
North America during the 1600s. How might these different reasons lead to different 
developments in the colonies? 
ENGLAND’S WARS, ENGLAND’S COLONIES 
Analyze the relationship between politics in England, internal colonial tensions, and life in 
the English colonies in North America during the 1600s. 
Th e tensions that led Pilgrims and Puritans to fl ee England erupted into a full-scale civil 
war in the 1640s in which King Charles I lost his head and a Puritan Commonwealth 
ruled the country for 11 years (1649–1660). The religious and political battles in 
England fueled settlement in North America. Puritans sought refuge in Massachusetts 
when they were feeling oppressed in England, supporters of the royal cause sought 
refuge in Virginia when the Puritans dominated at home, while Catholics moved to 
Maryland, and other dissidents found tolerant places like Rhode Island. 
When the civil wars ended and a new king, Charles II, eldest son of Charles I, 
began to rule in England in 1660, he also rewarded supporters with grants of yet more 
colonial charters. All of England’s tensions spilled over into its American colonies. 
More colonies were established, and many more English settlers arrived than might 
have been the case if their homeland had been at peace. 
As England’s American colonies were founded and began to grow, they were oft en 
violent places that refl ected old and new tensions. In the 1670s, internal tensions burst 
into violence in the colonies. King Philip’s War in Massachusetts was one of the most 
vicious wars ever fought in North America. In Virginia, backcountry farmers—took 
up arms against the royal governor in 1679. Th e growth, the tensions, and the violence 
all helped create the political and cultural structures of the colonies of British North 
America in the 1700s.

Civil War and Revolution in England 
When King James died in 1625, his son became King Charles I (r. 1625–1649). King 
Charles was known for his religious sincerity and lack of political skill. Th e king and 
his advisors pursued religious Anglican uniformity far more strictly than any of his 
predecessors had. Th e Puritan movement, however, grew despite royal opposition. 
By the late 1620s, Puritans were a majority in Parliament. As a result, in 1629, King 
Charles dismissed Parliament and did not convene it again for 11 years. 
But in 1640, rebellion broke out in Scotland. To suppress it, Charles needed new 
taxes, and to get them, he had to call Parliament back into session. Th at move was his 
undoing. Th e Parliament that met in November 1640 was overwhelmingly Puritan 
and passed laws that favored the Puritans and limited royal authority. 
By 1642, England was in a civil war. Parliament’s army defeated the king, 
who was executed in 1649. General Oliver Cromwell, ruled England as a Puritan 
Commonwealth from 1649 to 1658. By the time Cromwell died in 1658, many in 
England were tired of Puritan rule. In1660, Parliament invited the son of Charles I 
to reign as King Charles II (r. 1660–1685). Th e Anglican Church again became the 
offi cial state church, but the new king was more tolerant of religious diff erences than 
his father had been. Charles II also took an interest in expanding his North American 
colonies. Almost half of the colonies of the future United States—New York, New 
Jersey, Pennsylvania, North and South Carolina—date to his reign. 
Rebellion in New England—King Philip’s War, 1675–76 
Th e half-century of peace that the Pilgrims of Plymouth and the Wampanoag Indians 
experienced was unusual in North America It seemed that the two cultures could live 
side by side in relative harmony. But while there was harmony in Plymouth between 
1620 and 1675, there were also tensions, sometimes sharp ones. 
Early in Plymouth’s history, one incident showed just how violent the Pilgrims 
could be. When word came to Governor Bradford that their closest Indian ally, 
Massasoit, was desperately ill, Bradford sent Edward Winslow to treat the Wampanoag 
leader as a gesture of goodwill. 
While he was recovering, Massasoit told Winslow that another tribe, the 
Massachusetts Indians, who lived north of Plymouth, were preparing to attack 
Plymouth. Whether the wily Massasoit was reporting the truth or using the Pilgrims 
to settle an old score is unclear, but Bradford took him seriously. Under the command 
of Miles Standish, Pilgrim soldiers killed two of the tribe’s leaders. Th e Massachusetts 
Indians decided not to antagonize these violent Europeans and moved further north. 
Other tribes saw that, for good or ill, the alliance between Massasoit and the Pilgrims 
ran deep. But from Holland, the Pilgrim’s spiritual guide Pastor John Robinson, condemned 
“the killing of those poor Indians” warning, “where blood is once begun to be 
shed, it is seldom staunched of a long time aft er.” 
The Massachusetts Bay Puritans did not maintain peace for as long as the 
Plymouth settlers. Massachusetts Bay was larger, stronger, and less tolerant of outsiders 
than Plymouth. The Massachusetts Bay Puritans often traded with Indian 
tribes, especially the Pequots of the Connecticut River Valley. But when the captain 
of a trading vessel was killed in 1637, the Puritans responded harshly. Building an 
alliance with the Mohegans and Narragansetts, they attacked a Pequot fortress on 
the Mystic River, set the houses on fi re, and attacked anyone who fl ed. In the short 
Pequot War , 400 Pequots were killed, and their village was annihilated. Surviving 
Pequots were sold into slavery. From the Mohegans’ perspective, this confl ict was an 
opportunity to expand their infl uence. From the perspective of the Narragansetts, 
it was horrifying. Th ey were accustomed to Indian warfare that focused on the skill 
and bravery of a few, not the annihilation of the many. Europeans, they discovered, 
fought diff erently.

Other tensions between the English settlers and Indian tribes were also evident. Th e 
English did not tend to intermarry or engage in sexual liaisons with Indians as frequently 
as the Spanish or the French. Many parts of New Spain and New France were conquered 
by unmarried men who quickly developed intimate relationships with native women and 
created a mestizo (mixed European and Indian blood) community. Th ese relationships 
oft en helped to strengthen ties between cultures and reduce tensions. But New England 
was settled by English families, and their descendants tended to intermarry within the 
community. Th e English also had diff erent views of appropriate sexual relationships. Th e 
Puritans were not as straight-laced as later generations came to picture them, but they 
seldom had sex outside their own community. Th e result was that mixed-race people 
who bridged cultures were rarer in English colonies than elsewhere in the Americas. 
Additionally, the English, especially in New England, also wanted to convert the 
Indians to their religion. But most Indians resented and resisted missionaries, whether 
English, Spanish, or French. For all of his friendship with the Pilgrims, Massasoit distrusted 
Christianity. He saw the conversion of Indians on Cape Cod as a rejection of 
his role as their supreme chief. 
What fostered the most tension, however, was the constant growth of the 
European community. Th e 40 miles between Plymouth and the heart of Massasoit’s 
world provided a suffi cient barrier for people who generally walked everywhere, but 
the European population was expanding. By the 1660s, English settlements were 
springing up in every direction and were beginning to dominate. European livestock 
ate Wampanoag corn. Land sales that had once seemed wise now seemed to confi ne a 
new generation of Wampanoags. 
A new generation of Pilgrims and Wampanoags were coming to power, people 
who did not remember their early friendship. In 1657, Governor Bradford, who had 
led Plymouth for 37 years, died. At about the same time, Massasoit was succeeded, fi rst 
by his son Alexander, and shortly aft er by his other son Metacom (who was known to 
the Pilgrims as King Philip). 
Th roughout the 1670s, rumors circulated that Metacom was preparing for war. 
He denied that he had anything but peaceful intentions, but he was also buying arms 
and ammunition. In January, 1675, a Christian Indian, John Sassamon, told Josiah 
Winslow, Bradford’s successor as governor, that Metacom was indeed preparing for 
war. Winslow refused to believe Sassamon and sent him on his way. Soon thereaft er, 
Sassamon’s body was discovered. Metacom denied any role in his death and asked the 
authorities to allow the Wampanoags to settle what he saw as an internal matter. But 
instead, the Plymouth authorities hanged three of Metacom’s associates. 
Th e fi rst skirmishes of what was known as King Philip’s War —using Metacom’s 
English name—took place within 2 weeks of the executions, in June 1675. People in 
outlying towns took refuge in fortresses. Abandoned homes were burned. When a 
father and son left the Swansea garrison and found Indians vandalizing their home, 
they fi red on them. Th e Wampanoags did not want to draw the fi rst blood, but once 
shots had been fired they fought furiously. Within days, at least 10 of the English 
were killed. When the Plymouth militia gave chase, Indians simply melted into the 
woods, crossed a river, and lived to fight another day—and fight they did. Early 
encounters between Europeans and natives of the Americas had pitted matchlocks 
( diffi cult-to-fi re guns that were unusable in the rain) against Indian bows and arrows. 
However, in this war, both sides were armed with more modern fl intlocks that they 
could use with deadly aim against the other. 
As the war escalated, Europeans throughout New England lived in terror and died, 
whether in isolated settlements or larger towns. Colonial troops who did not understand 
Indian wars marched into ambushes and died by the scores. Indians died in 
even larger numbers, and the Wampanoag community was destroyed. Other tribes, 
even those that sought to remain neutral, were decimated. In western Massachusetts, 
aft er Indians burned the town of Springfi eld, colonists turned on friendly or neutral 
tribes, forcing them to join Metacom’s side or die. Despite pleas from the missionary

John Eliot to protect the “Praying Indians”—converts to Christianity who were loyal 
to the Massachusetts authorities—they were taken to relocation centers in Boston 
Harbor where many died of exposure and malnutrition. 
In one of the bloodiest battles of the war, known as the Great Swamp Fight of 
December 1675, a combined Massachusetts and Plymouth force attacked a fortress 
of the Narragansetts aft er tracking through swamps to get there. Even though 
the Narragansetts had remained neutral throughout the warfare, the English force 
destroyed the fort, killing perhaps 300 Narragansett warriors and burning alive 
another 300 women, children, and old people. Humanity seemed to have vanished 
from these descendants of those who sought to build a new Christian community. 
Throughout the winter of 1675–76, the outcome of the war was unclear. The 
European communities in New England risked being wiped out that winter. But in the 
summer of 1676, the Indians were running out of food. Some of the tribes that had been 
allied with Metacom drift ed away or shift ed their allegiance. Th e end came in August 
when Metacom and a few dedicated supporters were cornered in a swamp and killed. 
In a grisly end to the war, King Philip’s head was displayed on a pole in Plymouth 
for the next 20 years. Authorities in Plymouth and Boston expelled many of the 
Indians from New England. Over 1,000 Wampanoags and their allies, including 
Philip’s wife and son, were sold into slavery in the Caribbean. John Eliot, the longtime 
pastor to Christian Indians wrote, “To sell souls for money seems a dangerous 
merchandise.” But in the hatreds created by the war, these voices were not heard. 
The journal of Mary Rowlandson describes an Indian attack on 
her town of Lancaster, Massachusetts, in 1676, the death of 
her daughter and many friends, and her subsequent experience 
as an Indian captive. Despite the terror and loss in her story, the 
Rowlandson journal also represents one of the first accounts of an 
American Indian war dance—just before her captors’ successful 
attack on the town of Sudbury, Massachusetts. It also relates her relatively 
friendly conversations with Metacom (Philip) himself. 
On the tenth of February, 1676, came the Indians with great 
numbers upon Lancaster. …Hearing the noise of some guns, we 
looked out; several Houses were burning….There were five persons 
taken in one house. The Father and the Mother and a sucking 
Child they knocked on the head; the other two they took and 
carried away alive.…Some in our house were fighting for their 
lives, others wallowing in their blood, the House on fire over 
our heads.…But out we must go, the fire increasing and coming 
along behind us roaring, and the Indians gaping before us with 
their Guns, Spears, and Hatchets to devour us…yet the Lord by 
his Almighty power preserved a number of us from death, for 
there were twenty-four of us taken alive and carried Captive.… 
But now, the next morning, I must turn my back upon the 
Town, and travel with them into a vast and desolate Wilderness, 
I knew not whither. It is not my tongue or pen can express the 
sorrows of my heart and bitterness of my spirit that I had at this 
departure, but God was with me in a wonderful manner, carrying 
me along, and bearing up my spirit that it did not quite fail. 
One of the Indians carried my poor wounded Babe upon a horse; 
it went moaning all along, “I shall die, I shall die.” I went on foot 
after it with sorrow that cannot be expressed.…This day in the 
afternoon, about an hour by Sun, we came to …An Indian Town 
called Wenimessett [today New Braintree, MA]…About two hours 
in the night, my sweet Babe like a lamb departed this life.… 
During my abode in this place [after several moves], Philip 
spoke to me to make a shirt for his boy, which I did, for which he 
gave me a shilling…and with it I bought a piece of Horse flesh. 
Afterwards he asked me to make a Cap for his boy, for which he 
invited me to Dinner. I went, and he gave me a Pancake about 
as big as two fingers; it was made of parched wheat, beaten, and 
fried in Bear’s grease, but I never tasted pleasanter meat in my life. 
[Rowlandson was released by her captors in April as part of an 
unsuccessful peace initiative.]

Of the 70,000 people of all races living in New England at the beginning of the 
war, some 5,000 were killed—1,000 of the English and at least 4,000 Native Americans. 
King Philip’s War was one of annihilation; each side sought to destroy the other. In 
fact, the percentage of people killed in King Philip’s War was larger than corresponding 
percentages for the American Revolution, the Civil War, or World War II. For the 
Wampanoags, the war ended the independent nation that Metacom and his father 
Massasoit had led (see Map 3-2 ). 
Bacon’s Rebellion in Virginia, 1676 
As King Philip’s War was being fought in New England, Virginia was also engulfed in 
violence. Like the war in Massachusetts, Bacon’s Rebellion illustrated the instability 
of early colonial life and alliances that were constantly shift ing. King Philip’s War was 
a battle between Europeans and Indians. In Virginia, the confl ict was more complex.

indentured servants. At this time, there were at least as many Indian as African slaves 
in Virginia. However, most of the Virginia tribes kept their distance from the white 
settlements, except for occasional trade. 
Sir William Berkeley was the royal governor of Virginia from 1642 to the 1670s. 
He brought order to the colony, but it was an aristocratic order. He and an inner circle 
ran the government and retained most of the profi ts from the tobacco trade no matter 
who actually grew it. Th e corruption generated increasing tension among others as 
the social divide increased between rich whites and poor whites, between established 
landowners and newly arrived colonists (who could acquire land only along the western 
frontiers of the territory—closer to hostile tribes than colonists nearer the coast), 
and among Europeans, Africans, and Indians. Even if slaves and indentured servants 
did earn their freedom, land was increasingly diffi cult to acquire, and many were limited 
to becoming tenant farmers for wealthier land owners. 
In 1675, resentment came to a head. Th e economy was in the doldrums. Neither the 
corn crop, which was essential for food, nor the tobacco crop, which was essential for 
money, was doing well. When Indians from the Doig tribe raided Th omas Mathew’s 
plantation because Mathew supposedly had not paid for items obtained from the tribe, 
area colonists retaliated with an attack of their own. However, the colonists mistakenly 
attacked the Susquehanaug tribe instead of the Doigs. Violence was fl aring. 
At that point, Nathaniel Bacon, recently arrived in Virginia from a prosperous 
English family and already one of the largest landowners in the western part of 
the colony, organized a militia to attack the Indians. Bacon and his followers had 
heard news of King Philip’s War where many tribes had united. Th ey feared unity 
among Virginia’s tribes and had no intention of discriminating between friendly 
and unfriendly Indians. Bacon and his militia began attacking Indians indiscriminately, 
seeing every Indian as an enemy. Governor Berkeley, however, believed 
that Virginia needed friendly tribes on its frontier to protect it from hostile tribes

Document William Berkeley, 
Declaration against the Proceedings 
of Nathaniel Bacon, 1676 
As the rebellion in Virginia continued, Governor Berkeley 
complained about trying to govern people who were poor, 
discontented, and armed. Bacon had the support of most of the 
people, white and black, who were poor, indebted, unhappy, 
and well armed. He issued a Declaration of the People, stating 
the many reasons—from high taxes, to elite control of the fur 
trade, to lack of support in his Indian wars—for the rebellion. 
For having upon specious pretences of public works, raised 
unjust taxes upon the commonality for the advancement of private 
favourites and other sinister ends, but no visible effects in 
any measure adequate.… 
For having wronged his Majesty’s prerogative and interest by 
assuming the monopoly of the beaver trade.… 
For having protected, favoured and emboldened the Indians 
against his Majesty’s most loyal subjects, never contriving, requiring, 
or appointing any due or proper means of satisfaction for

For having the second time attempted the same thereby

Of these…we accuse Sir William Berkeley, as guilty.

who lived further west. He refused to support Bacon’s militia, and Bacon refused to 
have his militia disperse. Berkeley had Bacon arrested and then released him. Bacon 
marched his ragtag army of free Africans, slaves, and poor whites into Jamestown 
and set it on fi re. In the face of the militia, Governor Berkeley fl ed, calling for help 
from England. Th e crown sent 1,000 English troops; it had no patience with rebels. 
Most rebels surrendered and were pardoned. In 1676, Bacon died at age 29 from 
dysentery. Twenty-three leaders of the short-lived rebellion were hanged. Virginia’s 
poor had been crushed. 
Bacon’s Rebellion illustrates the complexity of American history. Berkeley was 
among the most overbearing aristocrats ever to govern a colony. During his more than 
30 years as governor, he made evident his disrespect for the majority of people in his 
colony. Bacon’s militia represented a racially diverse army of the dispossessed. But even 
as the rebels were demanding more equal treatment from Berkeley for themselves, they 
were also demanding the right to kill Indians indiscriminately and steal their land. 
Bacon’s Rebellion was a major turning point in the history of slavery in Virginia. 
Wealthy landowners now feared uprisings among current and former indentured servants, 
and they began to prefer slave labor, which they could more strongly control. 
Among the greatest losers in Virginia were the Native American tribes. While Bacon 
and his followers were defeated, the arrival of so many well-trained British troops 
reduced the power of the tribes to bargain. In 1677, the Indians of western Virginia 
ceded their remaining lands in the colony and moved west, continuing a process of 
“Indian removal” that would eventually span a continent.

FRANCE TAKES CONTROL OF THE HEART OF A CONTINENT 
Explain France’s growing role and power in North America and its impact on English and 
Spanish colonies. 
French explorers had been among the earliest Europeans to see much of the northern 
Atlantic coast of North America in the early 1500s. Little came of their discoveries, 
however, until a new European demand for beaver fur led French traders to set up trading 
outposts that became the permanent—if small—towns of Quebec and Montreal. 
During the long reign of King Louis XIV (r. 1643–1715), New France expanded from 
a tiny isolated community around Quebec to dominate the St. Lawrence River Valley. 
French communities were founded throughout the heartland of North America from 
Detroit and Chicago to New Orleans. By 1715, New France claimed far more of North 
America than either the English or Spanish (see Map 3-3 ). 
Early French Settlement—Quebec, Montreal, and the Fur Trade 
With the news that there seemed to be no way around North America, France, like 
England, lost interest in the land that Verrazano and Cartier had explored in the 1520s 
and 1530s. Later in the 1500s, however, a new trade emerged between Europeans and 
Native Americans to compete with the cod that had been the only North American 
resource of interest to most Europeans since before the days of Columbus. Beaver pelts 
were becoming popular for fur hats in Europe. Trade in beaver fur transformed the 
economies of both Europe and the tribes of North America as surely as the greed for gold 
and silver transformed South America. As tribes like the Montagnais and Hurons developed 
trading partnerships with the French, and the Iroquois with the English, trade and 
tribal warfare became more intense. Ancient rivalries among the Indians escalated as 
each tribe fought to control the supply of beaver furs that seemed in insatiable demand 
in Europe. While these tribes had long fought each other for honor, living space, and

MAP 3-3 France in the American Interior, 1670–1720. As this map shows, French exploration and claims 
to Montreal, the Saint Lawrence River Valley, the Great Lakes, and the Mississippi River all the way to the Gulf 
of Mexico gave it claim to the heart of North America but also completely encircled the English colonies on 
the Atlantic coast and challenged the Spanish for control of Texas. 
captives, they now had European weapons, acquired through trades, that further fueled 
the warfare. For the fi rst time, tribes seemed bent on annihilating their opponents. Even 
though the French and British fur traders preferred to make alliances with the Indians 
rather than enslave them, the results for many tribes were nevertheless disastrous. 
Th e trade in beaver pelts also encouraged Europeans to make permanent settlements. 
Samuel de Champlain began exploring the St. Lawrence River in 1603 and 
founded the city of Quebec in 1608 as a representative of a private fur company— 
just 1 year after the English founded Jamestown. With only 28 men in his colony, 
Champlain knew that he needed alliances if Quebec was to succeed. So he joined 
the Montagnais and Hurons in a war against the Iroquois and solidifi ed an alliance 
that would be the foundation of Quebec’s trade. The Huron alliance also allowed 
Champlain to travel further west. He spent 1615–1616 exploring the Great Lakes. 
Aft er 1612, Champlain was also appointed as the king’s Viceroy for New France, 
uniting his commercial and governmental positions. As late as 1635, when Champlain 
died, Quebec had a population of only 300, but it was there to stay. Montreal was

settled in 1642 to expand trade. Jesuit missionaries arrived and lived among the 
Hurons learning their ways, and seeking to convert them to Catholic Christianity. New 
France, and the missions it sponsored, were as deeply Catholic as most of the English 
settlements were Protestant, fueling tensions between the French and English colonies 
that would last throughout their histories. 
During the early 1600s, Quebec and Montreal were small French towns, thousands 
of miles from any other such town, but with their own European families, parishes, 
and culture. Th ese isolated centers were surrounded by villages of French farmers who 
had decided to make a life in New France. New France came close to being wiped 
out in the late 1640s when the Iroquois Confederation overran Huron villages, torturing, 
killing, or taking prisoner everyone in sight. Jesuit missionaries died along with 
their Huron hosts. Once a nation of over 10,000 people, the Hurons disappeared as a 
recognizable group aft er 1648. Th e defeat of the Hurons was a huge blow to French 
missionaries and to the fur trade that was the economic anchor of New France. 
Th e Iroquois also attacked French villages, and besieged Montreal itself. Two hundred 
French settlers were killed. Many more of the villagers left for France as quickly 
as they could. Th e future of New France was far from clear in 1650. Montreal and 
Quebec, however, remained militarily secure, and the Algonquians replaced the 
Hurons as the major French allies and the source of access to the fur trade. 
Exploring and Claiming the Mississippi River Valley 
In 1663, Louis XIV made New France into a royal province and sent 1,000 French soldiers 
to protect Quebec from Iroquois attack and establish it once and for all as the seat of what 
he expected to be a vast French empire. Plans were laid to make this expansion happen. 
In 1672, Governor Louis de Frontenac sent Louis Joliet, who spoke a number 
of Indian languages, and Father Jacques Marquette, a Jesuit missionary, to fi nd and 
explore a great waterway spoken of in Indian stories—the Mississippi (or Mitchisipi , 
“great water”), which he hoped might be the route to China. In June 1673, Marquette 
and Joliet paddled into the Mississippi, the fi rst Europeans known to do so. Early in 
their trip, they were welcomed by the Illinois tribe and given a great feast. Th e encounter 
was the beginning of a long-term French-Indian alliance in the region. 
Joliet and Marquette determined that the Mississippi fl owed south into the Gulf of 
Mexico, not west to the Pacifi c and China as had been hoped. But they understood that 
they were in the midst of a land of great potential. Th ey could develop a French colony 
that would allow a rich trade with the Indians and block the expansion of the English. 
This picture of Champlain and a group of Hurons 
attacking the Iroquois was published with 
Champlain’s account of the battle. It is unlikely 
that Champlain was as heroic as the picture 
implies, or that there were any palm trees in what 
is now Canada.

Fear of hostile tribes and of being captured by the Spanish led Joliet and Marquette 
to turn back before reaching the mouth of the Mississippi. On the return trip, they visited 
other Indian villages, including a Miami Indian village of Checagou or Chicago. 
Joliet returned to Quebec to report and draw maps of their travels. Marquette continued 
his missionary work until he died in 1675. What would, some two centuries 
later, become the Midwest of the United States was fi rst described for Europeans and 
mapped by these two explorers. While the authorities in France wanted to strengthen 
the settlements in the St. Lawrence River Valley surrounding Montreal and Quebec 
before expanding further, Governor Frontenac had no patience with such caution. In 
young Robert de la Salle, he found a perfect ally for exploring the Mississippi Valley. 
La Salle led a much larger expedition than that of Joliet and Marquette down the 
Illinois and Mississippi Rivers in 1679. La Salle’s goals were to build an alliance with the 
Illinois and other tribes against the Iroquois and to establish a permanent French presence 
throughout the Mississippi Valley. In 1681–82, he and his men traveled down the 
Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico. In the name of King Louis XIV, he claimed “possession 
of this country of Louisiana,” and of “the seas, harbors, ports, bays, adjacent straits, 
and all the nations, peoples, provinces, cities, towns, villages, mines, minerals, fi sheries, 
streams, and rivers within it.” It was a claim to more than one-third of North America. 
Not content with reaching the mouth of the Mississippi, La Salle then continued as 
far west on the Gulf of Mexico as Texas. Eventually, he pushed his followers too hard, 
and some of them murdered him in 1687. 
The Jesuit Relations , was a publication that gave regular reports 
on Jesuit missionary work and provided an extraordinary 
glimpse of the countryside and of the people who lived together 
along the Mississippi from modern-day Wisconsin to the Gulf of 
Mexico between the 1690s and the mid-1700s. 
I started in 1700, on the 8th of September, to come here.… 
I was accompanied by 5 Canoes manned by Frenchmen.…We 
made only 4 leagues the 1st day, because one of our canoes was 
split by a snag hidden in the water, and we had to halt in order 
to repair it.…I embarked in my Canoe to visit Monsieur Davion, a 
missionary priest, who was sick.…In his mission, 3 different languages 
are spoken: the Iakou, with 30 Cabins; the Ounspik, with 
10 or 12 Cabins, and the Toumika, who are in 7 hamlets, consisting 
in all of 50 or 60 small Cabins.… 
[Another] village is on the crest of a steep mountain, precipitous 
on all sides. There are 80 Cabins in it, and in the middle of 
the Village is a fine and very level open space, where from morning 
to night, young men exercise themselves. They run after a flat 
stone, which they throw in the air from one end of the square 
to the other, and try to Make it fall on two Cylinders, which they 
roll wherever they think the stone will fall. There is nothing fine 
about the temple except the Vestibule, which is embellished 
with the most pleasant and best executed grotesque figures that 
one can see. . . .The Old man who keeps up the fire—the name of 
which, he told us, was Louak ouloughé —the “sacred fire.”… 
Since we have left the Natches, we have lived only on Indian 
corn with a few Squashes—For it is a long time since either wild 
oxen, Deer, or bears have been seen in this quarter; and if we have 
found a few bustards or wild geese, they have been so lean that 
they were as tasteless as wood. This has caused our Canoemen very 
often to sigh for the River of the Illinois, And the beauty of the country 
and of the landing-places; and for the numbers of wild oxen and 
Deer, and all Kinds of fat and excellent Game. The navigation of the 
Mississippi is very slow and tedious, and very difficult—especially 
in ascending it. It is also very troublesome on account of the gnats 
and other insects called Mosquitoes, midges, And black flies.…At 
last, on the 17th of December, I reached fort Mississippi, after 68 
Days of navigation in descending the river.…The Commandant, 
Monsieur de Bienville, has there a small and very neat house.

Other French explorers and settlers followed in La Salle’s wake. Working independently, 
French trappers and traders (known as coureurs de bois or “runners of the 
woods”) established relationships with various Native American tribes and brought 
wealth back to New France. Some of them established a base called Fort Arkansas at 
the confl uence of the Arkansas and Mississippi Rivers. French Jesuits built a mission 
at Chicago. In1698, the Bishop of Quebec appointed missionary priests to a new mission 
at the Natchez Post on the Arkansas River. Th e French communities that dotted 
the Mississippi in the late 1600s and early 1700s were small. Th ey included American 
Indians and French trappers, families, and missionaries. But they were there to stay. 
Creating the French Gulf Coast—Biloxi, Mobile, and New Orleans 
As a result of the reports from explorers and missionaries, Louis XIV decided to secure 
the French claim to the mouth of the Mississippi. Pierre d’Ibreville was commissioned 
in 1698 to scout the area. 
D’Iberville landed on the east bank of the Mississippi River and built a fort near a Bilochi 
Indian settlement, which came to be called Biloxi. D’Iberville and his crew moved up the 
Mississippi River until they found a trail connecting the Mississippi to Lake Ponchartrain, 
and promised to return. To his surprise, d’Iberville also found a group of free blacks who 
were living with Indians and who did not take kindly to the arrival of Europeans. 
Queen Anne’s War of 1702–1713 (see Chapter 4 ) between England, France, 
and Spain made travel diffi cult and dangerous. With the coming of peace in 1713, 
d’Iberville’s younger brother Jean-Baptiste de Bienville expanded the colony. When 
a veteran of LaSalle’s trip down the Mississippi arrived in the area in 1713, d’Iberville 
gave the intrepid French explorer command of another French city on the Gulf coast, 
which they named La Mobile (now Mobile, Alabama). 
In 1718, de Bienville built a colony that he called New Orleans on the land between the 
Mississippi and Lake Pontchartrain. New Orleans appeared on French maps, and stock 
was sold to develop it, well before any town existed. In March and April 1718, Bienville 
led some 50 men in tearing out cypress swamps and laying out a town on the crescent 
turn in the Mississippi River. Aft er a hurricane destroyed the village in 1722, a new street 
grid was laid out—the French Quarter for which New Orleans is famous today. 
Th e only contact the residents of New Orleans had with France was the occasional 
arrival of supply ships. Few volunteers moved to this isolated spot, even though 
French speculators, led by John Law, the most powerful banker in France, invested

heavily in the New Orleans venture and were desperate for the new colony to succeed. 
Most of the early immigrants from France were prostitutes and criminals who 
literally left France in chains. Many died in transit, but by 1721, New Orleans had 178 
European residents who enjoyed the freedom their isolation gave them. 
Th e French also introduced African slavery into the Mississippi Valley. While there 
had been slaves in Quebec, none of the early explorers coming south from Canada 
brought African slaves with them. But aft er 1700, slavery grew in French Louisiana. 
Th e fi rst slave ships arrived in New Orleans in 1719. In 1721, ships brought 925 slaves 
from Haiti. A census in 1732 indicated that, of the 471 people living in the French 
towns in the Illinois River country, 168 were Africans. 
Most slaves brought to New Orleans were from Senegal in West Africa. These 
Africans, if not Muslim themselves, were familiar with Islam and Muslim music that 
used chanting accompanied by stringed instruments. Th is music became part of the 
culture of New Orleans. The Senegalese also knew how to cultivate indigo, which 
thrived in Louisiana, and how to process it into dye. In addition, early slave ships 
brought sugar and rice, which the slaves also knew how to grow. Europe and Africa 
had been shaping each other’s cultures for generations by the time New Orleans was 
founded, but the mix was especially deep in that city. With the French securely in control 
of both the headwaters and the mouth of the Mississippi River, France was in a 
strong position to be the dominant European power in North America, just as Spain 
was dominant further south.

Quick Review How did France’s role in North America evolve from small settlements in 
Canada to become the “dominant European power”? Justify your answer. 
DEVELOPMENTS IN SPANISH COLONIES NORTH OF MEXICO 
Analyze the impact of Indian uprisings and the expansion of other European powers on 
Spain’s colonies in New Mexico, Texas, and California. 
Spain had established the first permanent settlements in the future United States— 
Florida in 1565 and New Mexico in 1598. Both remained isolated, but while St. Augustine, 
Florida, remained small, Spain claimed vast lands in New Mexico surrounding the new 
capital they built at Santa Fe in 1610. From Santa Fe, which was close to many of the 
many Indian pueblos over which Spain claimed authority, the Spanish ruled with an iron 
hand, demanding more and more work from the Indians and trying to stamp out traditional 
Indian religious practices. For many years, the Spanish seemed to accomplish their 
goals, but eventually, to the surprise of the Spanish, the result was a large-scale rebellion. 
While the Spanish authorities reasserted their presence in New Mexico, they also worried 
about the territorial claims that England and France were making to other parts of 
North America. To counter those claims, the government of New Spain established small 
but permanent colonies across the Southwest from Texas to California (see Map 3-4 ). 
The Pueblo Revolt—New Mexico, 1680 
In August 1680, an uprising of the normally peaceful Pueblo Indians of northern New 
Mexico led by a charismatic leader, Popé, resulted in the greatest defeat of a European 
colony in the history of the Americas. In the Pueblo Revolt , nearly all of the Spanish 
who lived on isolated ranches and farms were killed. Survivors from the outlying communities 
poured into Santa Fe, which was then besieged. Th e Indians cut the city’s 
water supply and burned outlying buildings. On August 21, Governor Antonio de 
Otermin decided to retreat to Mexico with the survivors. 
During the retreat, one Indian told Otermin that the revolt happened because his 
people were “tired of the work they had to do for the Spaniards and the clergy [who] 
did not allow them to plant, to do other things for their own needs.” Another old man

told the governor that it was because the Spaniards had tried to take away “the ways 
of their ancestors, the faith by which they have lived and thrived.” Both of these grievances—
the harsh workloads and religious repression—were crucial in fueling the 
revolt, as was hope that life might return to a happier day before the Spanish arrived. 
Aft er the success of the revolt, Indian leaders lived in the governor’s mansion in 
Santa Fe. Churches were leveled, statues destroyed. Pueblo life returned more or less to 
what it had been before 1598. Th e distant and defeated Spanish were mocked. 
Th e Spanish eventually regained control of New Mexico, but it took 12 years. Nowhere 
else in the Americas, not even among the powerful Aztecs and Incas, was a revolt so successful 
or long lasting. In 1690, the Spanish viceroy in Mexico City appointed a new governor 
for New Mexico, Don Diego de Vargas, who had an ability to compromise that many 
of his predecessors had lacked. Vargas left El Paso with his army in 1692. He off ered each 
pueblo a full pardon in exchange for their reconversion to Christianity, but he did not try 
to stamp out tribal religion. Th e Indians could retain both faiths and agreed to his terms.

the future United States in Mexico and Peru. However, by the 1600s authorities based in Mexico had authorized 
the development of an important Spanish colony in territory they called New Mexico, among the Pueblo 
Indians in the area around Santa Fe and Taos. Spanish settlers also established a mission near the future 
Tucson, Arizona, though it would be after 1700 before there was Spanish settlement in Texas or California.

Spain’s Response to France and England—San Antonio, Texas, and 
the Missions of California 
Word that La Salle had claimed the coast of Texas for France frightened authorities in 
New Spain. When the French founded New Orleans in 1718, the Spanish decided to 
act. Th ey built a new city of their own, San Antonio, to assert their claims to Texas. San 
Antonio remained a small and isolated outpost of a great empire, but it was the fi rst 
permanent European settlement in present-day Texas. 
By 1769, the Spanish were also worried about English explorations and Russian 
fur-trading activities on the Pacifi c coast. In response, the Spanish established a fort 
and then a mission in San Diego, the fi rst permanent European settlement in what is 
now the U.S. state of California. From there, Spanish Franciscan missionaries created a 
string of missions from San Diego to San Francisco to convert the Indians and develop 
the economy of California. Before the American Revolution, permanent Spanish communities 
could be found on the Atlantic Coast in Florida, in Texas and New Mexico, 
and on the Pacifi c Coast in California (see Map 3-5 ). It would be many more years 
before any of these were much more than small dusty outposts. Nevertheless, they 
were the foundation for the much more extensive settlement that would follow. 
3.4 Quick Review Why was Spain so concerned about English and French colonization? 
CONCLUSION 
The nations of Europe showed little interest in establishing settlements north of 
Mexico until the early 1600s.Th e coast of what is now the United States served as little 
more than a way station for cod fi shermen throughout all of the 1500s. Aft er Richard 
Hackluyt published his Pamphlet for the Virginia Enterprise in 1585, some English 
investors began to take a second look and see the merit of establishing colonies in 
North America not only to trade with the Indians but also to Christianize them and 
enlist them as an ally against England’s rival Spain. Th e fi rst successful English colony 
was established at Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607. The colony would not have been 
lasted without the leadership of the English adventurer John Smith or the assistance of 

Chapter 3 Settlements, Alliances, and Resistance 91 
Powhatan, an Algonquian chief, who saw an advantage in establishing trade with the 
English and using them as allies against other Indian tribes. 
Unlike Jamestown, which had been established as a commercial enterprise by 
the Virginia Company, the colonies in the areas of present-day New England were 
established as refuges for England’s persecuted and restive religious nonconformists, 
including the Puritans and Pilgrims, who founded colonies in Plymouth and Boston 
in Massachusetts. Soon, dissenters from these colonies founded their own new English 
colonies in Connecticut and Rhode Island. 
Th e New England colonies coexisted for some time with nearby Indian groups. 
However, unlike the French and Spanish colonists, very little intermarriage took place, 
which might have increased the degree of animosity that soon developed as the New 
England colonies grew in size and encroached on Indian lands. This hostility ultimately 
led to King Philip’s War in the 1670s, in which the English colonists destroyed 
Indian settlements, ending the era of coexistence that some in the fi rst generation had 
enjoyed. While King Philip’s War was being fought in New England, a diff erent kind of 
violence engulfed the Virginia colony. White immigrants, mostly poor people, living at 
a distance from the coast, made alliances with Africans, slave and free, in attacks on the 
nearby Native American tribes. Th ese allied groups also attacked the royal government 
based on the Atlantic coast, which sought peaceful relationship with the Indian tribes 
as a way of preserving the colony. Th e revolt was soon defeated, but it resulted in the 
expulsion of most tribes from Virginia as well as a decision by the authorities to limit 
the immigration of poor whites and rely more on African slave labor in the colony. 
Aft er the establishment of Virginia and the New England colonies, other English 
colonies became established in quick succession. Maryland became a haven for 
Catholics, who were also being persecuted in England. Carolina began to expand 
production of rice and tobacco. New York was acquired from the Dutch, and New 
Jersey split off of New York. Pennsylvania was established initially for the Quakers, 
and Delaware eventually split from that colony. Finally, Georgia was founded, thus 
establishing England’s 13 colonies on the mainland of North America. 
All of the English colonies permitted slavery of Africans and American Indians, 
and slaves were found in all of the English colonies on the North American mainland 
and in even greater numbers on the English-controlled islands of the Caribbean. 
However, during most of the 1600s, slaves worked and lived alongside—and even 
rebelled with—white indentured servants and members of the white lower classes. 
Some slaves were even able to farm their own land, and in some cases earn their freedom—
something that would be much more diffi cult to achieve aft er 1700. 
Meanwhile, as England monitored its colonies, France and Spain had claimed control 
over much of the rest of North America. New France claimed not only vast areas 
surrounding Quebec but also a huge slice of the interior along the entire length of 
the Mississippi River down to New Orleans. New Spain expanded into the Southwest 
of the future United States from Texas to California. New France and New Spain 
exploited their territories and related to Indians in far diff erent ways. French explorers 
along with Jesuit missionaries created small settlements and expanded the fur trade 
throughout their vast territory. Spain also created settlements in their region and sent 
priests to live with many of the tribes. In one case, however, Spanish eff orts to subjugate 
the Indians of New Mexico led to the Pueblo Revolt of 1680. In spite of revolts, wars, 
and tensions, however, by the end of the 1600s, settlements established by England, 
France, and Spain dotted the land that would one day be the United States. Individual 
colonies might prosper or fail, but the territory that most Europeans had ignored for a 
hundred years aft er Columbus was slowly becoming a permanent home to generations 
of European immigrants and the African peoples they brought with them.

ENGLAND’S WARS, ENGLAND’S COLONIES 
3.2 
Analyze the relationship between politics in England, internal 
colonial tensions, and life in the English colonies in North 
America during the 1600s. 
Summary 
The tensions that led Pilgrims and Puritans to flee England 
erupted into a full-scale civil war in the 1640s in which King 
Charles I lost his head and a Puritan Commonwealth ruled 
the country for 11 years. Th e religious and political battles in 
England fueled settlement in North America. Puritans sought 
refuge in Massachusetts, supporters of the royal cause fl ed to 
Virginia, Catholics moved to Maryland, and other dissidents 
found such tolerant places as Rhode Island. When King Charles 
II was put on the throne in 1660, he also rewarded supporters 
with grants of new colonial charters, including New York and 
Pennsylvania. In the 1670s, long simmering tensions burst into 
violence in the colonies. King Philip’s War in Massachusetts was 
one of the most vicious wars ever fought in North America. In 
Virginia, poor farmers as well as slaves and indentured servants 
who lived far from the rich coastal communities took up arms 
against the royal governor in Bacon’s Rebellion. Th e uprising 
was a major turning point in the history of slavery in Virginia.

THE ENGLISH SETTLE IN NORTH AMERICA 
3.1 
Explain why the English began to settle in North America and 
how slavery was introduced in the English colonies. 
Summary 
In 1607, Jamestown, the fi rst permanent British settlement in 
North America, was established in what would become the 
colony of Virginia. Th e settlement’s early years were marked by 
poor planning, disease, and tense relations with local Indians. 
Th e shift from trade with Indians to tobacco-based agriculture 
in the 1620s ensured the colony’s survival but increased confl 
ict between colonists and Indians. In the early 1600s, many in 
England came to see settlement of North America as a solution 
to England’s overpopulation and religious confl icts. Puritans 
established settlements in Massachusetts in the 1620s and 
1630s. Th e government and society they created refl ected their 
religious beliefs. The first slaves arrived in Virginia in 1619. 
Slavery in British North America before the 1680s, although 
still diffi cult, was neither as harsh nor as absolute as later forms 
of American slavery. 
Review Questions 
1. Chronological Reasoning 
How and why did the relationship between the Jamestown 
colonists and the local Indians change during the settlement’s

its impact on English and Spanish colonies. 
Summary 
Th e fur trade transformed New France, attracting French settlers 
and leading to conflict among Indian peoples. During 
the long reign of King Louis XIV (r. 1643–1715), New France 
expanded from a tiny isolated community around Quebec to 
dominate the St. Lawrence River Valley. As the result of French 
expeditions into the interior of North America, French communities 
were founded around the Great Lakes and down the 
Mississippi River to New Orleans. With the French in control 
of both the headwaters and the mouth of the Mississippi River, 
France was in a strong position to be the dominant European 
power in North America, just as Spain was dominant in Mexico 
and South America.

Summary 
Spanish eff orts to impose a harsh colonial regime on the Pueblos 
of New Mexico led to a large rebellion. While the Spanish were 
eventually able to reassert their presence in New Mexico, they 
also worried about the claims that England and France were 
making to other parts of North America. To counter those 
claims, the government of New Spain established small but permanent 
colonies across the Southwest from Texas to California.

Creating the Culture of 
4 British North America 
1689-1754 
In 1733 a young apprentice, John Peter Zenger, was hired to start a new 
newspaper in New York, the New York Weekly Journal . Newspapers, 
though long popular in England, were still fairly new in British North 
America. The first regularly published colonial newspaper, The Boston 
News-Letter, began publication in 1704, but it was subsidized by the British 
government. Later newspapers, including James Franklin’s New England 
Courant that began publication in 1722 were more independent. The 
Journal ’s New York backers were part of a political faction in the colony 
that opposed Royal Governor William Cosby. Zenger quickly began printing 
stories about offi cial corruption and government actions he considered 
to be dictatorial. Within a year, he was indicted for printing seditious libel. 
British law at the time made it a crime to print attacks on public offi cials 
that challenged their authority—whether the articles were false or true— 
and Zenger had clearly printed attacks on Governor Cosby. But Zenger and 
his backers fought back, defending themselves in court. 
In a well-publicized trial that lasted into 1735, Zenger’s attorney argued 
for rights of speech and the press that far exceeded what then existed in 
Britain. He asked the jury, “Shall the press be silenced that evil governors 
may have their way?” The trial, the attorney said, was not about Zenger 
but “every free man that lives under a British government on the main of 
America.” Th e jury acquitted Zenger in spite of the law.

Chapter 4 Creating the Culture of British North America 95 
Zenger’s acquittal has been celebrated ever since as a key victory for freedom of 
speech and freedom of the press. In part it was a victory. Zenger was free to keep 
up his critique, and other publishers were emboldened by the result. On the other 
hand, the laws against seditious libel were not repealed, and every editor of Zenger’s 
day knew that there was a danger of arrest and trial before a jury that might not be 
as sympathetic as the one Zenger faced. Nevertheless, by the 1730s, there were more 
than 20 newspapers being printed in the North American colonies, and the majority 
included not only critiques of royal governors and colonial governments but also 
republished articles from the English press demanding freedom and calling attention 
to what they called “the rights of Englishmen.” Th ese newspapers also published news 
from other colonies and began to create a stronger sense of unity among Americans—a 
name that residents of the British colonies were starting to call themselves. 
Th e defense of freedoms that Zenger and his attorneys considered basic to their 
rights as residents of the British colonies clearly reflects the views of a growing 
number of English inhabitants of North America at the time. Th e great divisions over 
religious and political authority, which had created turmoil and uprisings in England 
and in the colonies, were receding into the dim past. In spite of numerous new 
tensions, many who lived in America between 1690 and 1760 were feeling a strong 
sense of pride in being British—enjoying the prosperity that the British Empire was 
creating and appreciating an elected Parliament that was playing a dominant role in 
asserting individual liberties. However that pride in British institutions and British 
rights slowly changed as some colonists began to shift their loyalties. Over time, many 
came to distrust the British government as protector of their rights and began to talk 
of a way to separate from that government and protect their own rights as colonists. 
Understanding that shift is key to understanding the decades before the American 
Revolution. 
ENGLAND’S GLORIOUS REVOLUTION AND “THE RIGHTS OF 
ENGLISHMEN,” 1689 
Analyze the impact of England’s Glorious Revolution on the thinking and political 
organization of British colonists in North America. 
The 25 years between 1675 and 1700 were times of turmoil in England and its 
North American colonies. A little more than a decade aft er King Philip’s War and 
Bacon’s Rebellion convulsed the colonies, the English Parliament came to distrust 
King James II who they believed was centralizing too much authority and who they 
suspected of privately supporting Catholicism. Th ey ousted him in 1689 in what 
was known as the Glorious Revolution. For many in England and its colonies, it 
was an exciting time, an assertion of “the rights of Englishmen” and the authority 
of elected assemblies to control their destiny. Initially, news of the overthrow of 
James II brought rebellions in many of the colonies. Royal governors were arrested, 
and popular assemblies demanded new authority, just as Parliament had done in 
London. Soon enough, a new English government asserted its authority in colonial 
matters. In the process, a new sense of rights had been created on both sides of the 
Atlantic Ocean. 
Parliament’s Decision to “Elect” a New King and Queen 
King James II (r. 1685–1688), who came to the English throne at the death of his brother 
Charles II, was a Catholic, even though he was offi cially the head of the Protestant 
Church of England. As he expanded religious freedoms for Catholics and appointed 
some to high office, his moves aroused serious opposition in Britain’s Protestant 
majority, many of whom associated Protestantism with British independence and 
Catholicism with foreign domination, especially by the Spanish and French.

Bloodless revolt that occurred in England 
in 1688 when parliamentary leaders invited 
William of Orange, a Protestant, and his

James II. 
The New England Courant , one of the early colonial 
newspapers, was published from 1722 to 1726, 
but both its publisher James Franklin and his 
younger brother Benjamin continued to publish 
newspapers in the 1720s and 1730s.

James also wanted to assert royal authority, especially in England’s increasingly 
independent colonies. He appointed a single royal governor, Sir Edmund Andros, 
over a newly designated Dominion of New England, which comprised Plymouth, 
Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Connecticut, Rhode Island, as well as New York 
and New Jersey. He also abolished most of the local autonomy that the colonies 
had enjoyed. 
Th e colonists resented the unwanted merger of their colonies as well as the new 
king and governor who were enforcing it, but they could do little about it. However, 
in England, Parliament turned against James II. Rather than risk losing his head like 
his father, James fl ed the country. Parliament invited James’s Protestant daughter, 
Mary, and her husband Prince William of Orange, rulers of the Netherlands, to come 
to England as joint sovereigns. Th is move by Parliament was a dramatic change that 
would have far-reaching eff ects. Th e concept of the divine right of kings , by which 
the sovereign—good or bad—inherited the throne from the previous sovereign and 
ruled with unquestioned authority, was already in decline. But now, Parliament, had 
decided not only to limit royal authority but also to take some control over the choice 
of a king or queen themselves. 
To justify the ouster of one king and the virtual election of new monarchs, 
English people had to rethink how they understood themselves and their system of 
government. Kings and queens retained power aft er 1689, but their supremacy was 
now bound by law. Aft er 1689, it was clear that Parliament, as representative of the 
people, was a deciding force in England. 
John Locke—Defending the Right to Revolution 
Th e most famous English philosopher at the time of the Glorious Revolution, John 
Locke, justifi ed the revolution by insisting that all government rested on the natural 
rights of the governed. Th is concept was a novel idea in 1689, but Locke, who was 
living in exile in Holland because of his opposition to James’s rule, wrote that humans 
were born free in a state of nature and only agreed to a social compact when it suited 
their purposes. If the people no longer agreed, then monarchs had no right to continue 
to rule. Th e basic “rights of all Englishmen” to accept or reject their government came 
to be the dominant political ideology of the English nation—as it then existed on both 
sides of the Atlantic. 
In his Second Treatise on Government , Locke described civil society as a social 
contract made by free people to live together, but one in which everyone retained “his 
natural freedom, without being subjected to the will or authority of any other man.” 
Neither kings nor Parliament were supreme. Th e people were. Locke insisted, “Th ere 
remains still in the people a supreme power to remove or alter the legislative [power] 
when they find the legislative act contrary to the trust reposed in them.” Locke’s 
revolutionary ideas helped justify the Glorious Revolution of 1689. A hundred years 
later, his ideas would be cited oft en in North America. 
North American Responses 
In England’s American colonies, news of the Glorious Revolution brought rejoicing. 
In New England, the colonists arrested Governor Andros and sent him back 
to England, though he later returned as Governor of Virginia. The new monarchs, 
William and Mary, allowed the New England colonies to return to their former separate 
existences. However, when the king and queen reestablished the governments 
of Massachusetts and Connecticut, they included a clause in the royal charters granting 
“liberty of Conscience” to all Protestants—but not Catholics. Baptists, Anglicans, 
and others were now free to build their own churches and worship as they wished. 
Some Puritans protested against this “tolerance for error,” as they called allowing other 
churches to conduct their own services, but the rules stuck in spite of their protests. 
divine right of kings 
A belief that the king—or queen—was 
selected by God through birth in the royal 
family and that it was irreligious to question 
either a monarch’s fitness to serve or a monarch’s 
decisions. During the 1600s, England 
overthrew two monarchs, and afterwards, 
few still held such a belief. 
natural rights 
Political philosophy that maintains that

THE PLANTATION WORLD: FROM A SOCIETY WITH SLAVES TO A 
SLAVE SOCIETY 
Explain why and how slavery developed as it did in the late 1600s and early 1700s. 
Amid all the talk of “the rights of Englishmen,” one group of North American residents 
lost rights aft er the 1680s—African slaves. All of the British colonies had slaves in the 
late 1600s, but the institution of slavery changed most dramatically in the southern 
colonies—Maryland, Virginia and, soon, also the Carolinas. Bacon’s Rebellion brought 
great changes to Virginia and its neighbor Maryland aft er 1676. Once the planter elite 
had defeated Bacon’s ragtag militia, they quickly consolidated their power. Th ey did 
not want another rebellion like the one they had just lived through in which poor 
whites allied with Africans, slave and free. Having decided that slaves would make 
better and more dependable workers than indentured servants, this planter elite wrote 
new slave codes that more clearly made slavery an inherited and permanent status. 
Th ey also imported many more African slaves and reduced the numbers of English 
indentured servants allowed into these colonies. Historian Ira Berlin described this 
shift : “A society with slaves gave way to a slave society.” It was a signifi cant change— 
from a society in which slavery existed to a society in which the institution of slavery 
dominated all aspects of society—particularly for those who were enslaved. Although 
this shift began in Virginia and Maryland, its eff ects would eventually extend to other 
southern colonies. 
4.2 
Other Protestants were free to build churches—at their own expense—and worship 
freely, but everyone paid taxes to support the Congregationalists, and Catholic worship 
was not allowed in New England. 
In New York, news of the change in England brought a general uprising. Th ose on 
the bottom of the social order—merchants, dockworkers, and traders—seized power 
under the leadership of a German immigrant, Jacob Leisler. Leisler held power for 
2 years, but when he was slow in ceding power to the new royal governor appointed 
by William and Mary, he was arrested and executed for treason. However, those loyal 
to Leisler remained a faction in New York politics for a generation to come. 
In Maryland, there was also an uprising. Th e Catholic proprietor was driven from 
offi ce and lost ownership of the colony. Maryland became a royal colony with a governor 
appointed by the king and queen, and the Anglican Church of England became the 
colony’s offi cial church. Aft er the Glorious Revolution, Maryland, a colony that had 
been chartered in 1632 to protect Catholics, excluded Catholics from public offi ce. 
In the Americas, the Glorious Revolution produced winners and losers. Aft er 1689, 
independent corporations like the Virginia Company and the Massachusetts Company 
as well as of colonial proprietors like Lord Baltimore or William Penn faced a decline 
in power. Catholics in England and Maryland lost hard-won political rights as the 
new monarchs asserted England’s status as a Protestant nation. All Protestants gained 
rights, and Protestant men who had been excluded from the voting lists because they 
belonged to a dissenting religious group could now vote. Elected legislatures (elected 
by landowning white males) competed with royal governors to make the laws governing 
each colony. In all the colonies, changing one’s social and economic status was 
becoming more difficult. An English colonial elite, supported by English military 
authority, now dominated colonial life. Th e British communities became larger, more 
secure, and wealthier.

Seeking Stability by Creating a Slave Society 
As the institution of slavery came to be more rigidly defi ned, it also came to be linked 
more closely to race. Africans were seen as slaves. Europeans—even the poorest 
Europeans—were seen as free. More and more Indians were simply excluded from 
the colonies. Th ose Africans who had already achieved their freedom, and those few 
who did so during the 1700s, lived in a dangerous world. While Anthony Johnson 
had moved from slavery to freedom and prosperity in the Virginia of the mid-1600s 
(see Chapter 3 ), his children and grandchildren fl ed from Virginia in the late 1600s to 
avoid the risks of slavery, some of them living with the Nanticoke Indians in a small 
community of African, European, and American Indian origin. 
Children of mixed race were marginalized or simply declared to be African slaves. Any 
child born to a black woman was automatically considered to be African even if, as was 
oft en the case, the father was a European slave-owner. But mixed-race children born to 
white mothers were more problematic to marginalize or cast into slavery, so stringent eff orts 
were made to prohibit sexual liaisons between white women and males of other races. 
While there were slaves in all of England’s North American colonies, as slavery 
became institutionalized, the numbers of African slaves in the southern colonies rose 
dramatically. In the 1680s, approximately 2,000 Africans were shipped to Virginia. 
Between 1700 and 1710, approximately 8,000 arrived. In 1668, white indentured 
servants outnumbered African slaves by five to one, and there were about equal 
numbers of Indian and African slaves. By 1700, nearly all tobacco and rice workers in 
Virginia and the Carolinas were African slaves (see Map 4-1 ). 
The Atlantic Slave Trade, the Middle Passage, and the Nature 
of Colonial Slavery 
North American slavery was always a relatively small part of the Atlantic slave trade. Th e 
sugar plantations of the Caribbean, Brazil, and New Spain needed many more slaves— 
and slaves there died much more quickly—so there was a constant fl ow of slaves to islands 
controlled by the English, French, Dutch, Danish, and Spanish and to the South American 
mainland. Some 10–15 million Africans were forced across the Atlantic between 1500 and 
1900, but only a fraction came to the mainland British colonies (see Map 4-2 ).

As economic developments in all of North and South America came to depend more and more on slavery, 
the hunt for slaves went deeper and deeper into the African continent, leading to slave coffl es—as they 
were known—in which newly captured people were marched hundreds of miles to the coast for transport 
across the Atlantic in numbers never before seen.

New states in West Africa—Asante, Dahomey, and Oyo—emerged along the 
African coast, fueled by the transfer of slaves from the interior of Africa to the coast 
for sale and shipment to the Americas. Some African states such as Benin refused to 
engage in the slave trade. But those that did grew rich as the slave trade grew rapidly. 
What had been a limited, if brutal, business now seemed to have no limit. For most 
West Africans, the huge growth of the African slave trade was a disaster. In addition 
to the warfare and fear among Africans that the slave trade inspired, the continent lost 
millions of people, which sapped its strength. 
Once slaves arrived on the African coast, they were kept naked in cramped quarters 
in what were called slave factories. Th ey were fed only bread and water. Th ose

Men were chained shoulder to shoulder. Women were generally not chained but packed 
just as tightly for a voyage that took 7 weeks in a fi lthy ship’s hold that stank of human 
waste. Th e rate of disease was high: 25 percent of slaves died on the voyage. Slaves were 
force fed to reduce the loss of valuable cargo to starvation. One slave trader noted the 
tendency of slaves “to revolt aboard ships.” Slaves would, he said, “watch all opportunities 
to deliver themselves, by assaulting a ship’s crew, and murdering them all.” Slaving 
was a dangerous and dirty but profi table business. 
Th e fi rst generation of slaves in North America, those arriving in the early 1600s, 
came from the coast of West Africa. Th ey were familiar, at least in a general way, with 
each other and with European culture and languages since Europeans had been trading 
along the coast for more than 100 years. Th ose who arrived later oft en had been captured 
much further inland. Th ey knew little about European ways or about each other.

102 Part II Settlements Old and New, 1607–1754 
The first generation of slaves were allowed some dignity, but by 
the late 1600s, every eff ort was made to rob slaves of their self-respect. 
Slaves were inspected like animals by those who bought and sold them. 
Masters used names as part of an eff ort to break the slaves’ spirits. New 
slaves were named Jack or Sukey or Jumper or Hercules. Slave marriages 
were not recognized by law, and a master could sell husband away from 
wife or children from parents. 
Olaudah Equiano was born around 1745. According to his 
autobiography, he was captured when he was 11 years old, shipped 
to America, and put to work first as a domestic servant in Virginia 
and then aboard a ship. He had much better luck than most slaves, 
eventually purchasing his freedom and writing a description of his 
experiences that became an early tract for the budding antislavery 
movement. He reported what it meant to be taken onboard a slave ship 
on the coast of Africa: 
I was soon put down under the decks, and there I received 
such a salutation in my nostrils as I had never experienced in 
my life: so that, with the loathsomeness of the stench, and crying 
together, I became so sick and low that I was not able to 
eat, nor had I the least desire to taste anything. I now wished 
for the last friend, death, to relieve me; but soon, to my grief, 
two of the white men off ered me eatables; and, on my refusing 
to eat, one of them held me fast by the hands, and laid me 
across I think the windlass, and tied my feet, while the other 
fl ogged me severely. 
Millions of other Africans suffered the same experiences but never 
achieved the freedom that Equiano did. 
Most Africans, especially those imported into the southern colonies 
aft er the 1680s, faced a lifetime of slavery on a tobacco, cotton, or rice 
plantation. Th eir diffi cult lives were not long ones. Until the mid-1700s, one-quarter 
of newly arrived slaves died within a year. Young children oft en worked in the fi elds 
alongside adults, and the labor for women and men was backbreaking from sunup to 
sundown. Th e law gave plantation owners a free hand in how they treated their slaves. 
Slaves were whipped, branded, tortured, and executed for the smallest infractions to 
warn others of what resistance would mean. Total and unquestionable authority became 
the order of the day for male owners, making them absolute monarchs over their slaves. 
By the early 1700s, a small group of plantation owners controlled nearly all aspects of 
life in the southern colonies. It was a society in which slaves were given no respect, a 
few wealthy white males had unlimited power, and the institution of slavery defi ned 
the social order. 
The Fear of Slave Revolts: South Carolina and New York 
In the early 1700s, British landowners, especially in the southern colonies, imported 
more and more slaves from Africa. Th e production of tobacco, rice, and indigo was 
growing quickly. Charleston, South Carolina, became the largest slave trading center 
in mainland North America. But slaves did not accept their fate easily. Th ey longed for 
and sometimes fought for their freedom. As more white colonists came to depend on 
slave labor for their growing prosperity, they also lived in constant fear of slave revolts, 
uprisings that were far from uncommon in all of the colonies. Two examples refl ect the 
volatile conditions throughout the colonies. 
THE STONO SLAVE REBELLION OF 1739 England and Spain were often at war, 
making the border between Spanish Florida and British South Carolina and Georgia 
a tense boundary (see Map 4-3 ). In 1693, Spain off ered freedom to all fugitives from

The Middle Passage, 1788 
According to his popular autobiography, Olaudah 
Equiano was captured in Nigeria in 1756 when he 
was 11 years old, sold into slavery, and unlike the 
vast majority of slaves of his generation, eventually 
was able to purchase his freedom and rise to prosperity. 
The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah

British territories who came into Spanish territory and converted to Catholicism. 
Many Carolina slaves heard about Spain’s off er, and the number of runaways increased. 
Throughout the early 1700s, a steady stream of slaves managed to make their 
way to Florida and freedom. Some of these runaways were already Catholic because 
they came from parts of Africa, such as the Kingdom of Kongo, long since converted 
by Portuguese missionaries. For others, converting to Catholicism was a route to 
freedom. At fi rst, the Spanish authorities were slow to make good on their promise, 
but they soon realized the value of their policy. Th e runaway slaves were a drain on the 
Carolina economy and an embarrassment to the British. In addition, the newly freed 
slaves were a strong fi rst line of defense on the Spanish side of the border. Aft er all, as 
newly free people in Spanish Florida, they had special reason to defend the territory 
from the British, who wanted to perpetuate their slavery. 
One of these former Carolina slaves, Francisco Menendez, won a special 
commendation from the Spanish in 1728 for his heroism in defending St. Augustine 
from English attack. When the Spanish authorities decided to create a separate 
settlement they called Mose—to the north of St. Augustine—as a buff er against further 
attacks, the Spanish governor placed Menendez in charge. Mose was more a fort than 
a town, but it was home to approximately 100 Africans who defended Florida and 
organized attacks on the British in South Carolina. 
A large eff ort by Carolina slaves to gain freedom in Spanish Florida in 1739 came 
to be called the Stono Rebellion , the largest slave uprising in the colonies before 
the American Revolution. It terrifi ed slave masters throughout the British colonies. 
Th e rebellion began when some 60 slaves from the South Carolina rice plantations, 
led by a slave named Cato, walked off their plantations, armed themselves, burned 
buildings of the slave owners, and killed whites who got in their way as they sought 
freedom in Spanish Florida. Fearful slave owners sent the South Carolina militia to 
stop them. In a battle at Stono, South Carolina, 50 miles from what was then the 
Florida border, many of the rebels and their white pursuers were killed. Other slaves 
were captured and returned to slavery. But some made it to freedom in Florida and

joined the free black community there. In response, the white planter government 
of South Carolina temporarily restricted the importation of more African slaves and 
permanently curtailed the rights of slaves to assemble with one another. 
Aft er the Stono Rebellion was crushed, individual slaves continued to escape south 
across the border. Menendez, the former slave, had further adventures. Traveling to 
Spain, he was captured by the British and threatened with execution, but he eventually 
escaped and, by 1752, was again back leading the militia in Florida. By 1763, Mose had 
a population of 3,000, mostly escaped slaves. When Spain ceded Florida to Britain in 
that year, they moved the Mose Africans to Cuba, where they were given land, tools, a 
subsidy, and ironically, a slave for each leader in the community. 
TENSIONS IN NEW YORK CITY, 1741 In the 1700s, slavery was not limited to the 
southern colonies. New York City and Providence, Rhode Island, had some of the 
largest concentrations of slaves in North America at that time. New York’s African- 
American community included approximately 2,000 out of the city’s 10,000 residents. 
Slave labor in New York might not have been as backbreaking as on a Virginia 
tobacco or Carolina rice plantation, but it was slavery nonetheless. Slaves did the worst 
jobs, got no pay, and had limited freedom. Th ey could also be sold south at any time. 
Nevertheless, unlike rural slaves, urban slaves had a chance to meet other slaves, either 
at their work or in those taverns that welcomed them. Some of these opportunities 
frightened whites, leading them to react to what they assumed was pending rebellion. 
In the early months of 1741, fires swept New York, destroying businesses and 
homes including the governor’s house. Governor George Clarke became convinced 
that “Th e Negros are rising.” Whether or not slaves had anything to do with it, the 
1741 fires were real. New Yorkers were suffering through a harsh winter. News of 
South Carolina’s Stono Slave Rebellion was in circulation, and memories of other slave 
revolts were fresh. Th ere had been a slave revolt in the Caribbean in the 1730s. In 1712, 
New York slaves had killed nine whites and wounded six more. Fear spread easily. 
A zealous prosecutor became convinced that there was a conspiracy to kill the 
city’s whites, so he brought charges against targeted suspects, pitted accused against 
accused, and elicited confessions. Th irty Africans, most of them slaves, and four whites 
were executed, either hanged or burned at the stake. Eighty-four other suspects were 
transported to slavery in Jamaica. Th e degree to which New Yorkers experienced an 
actual revolt as opposed to being caught up in a fear-induced mass hysteria will never 
be known, but the trials illustrate the way those who enslaved others also feared the 
reality that they had created.

STABILITY AND INSTABILITY IN THE AMERICAN AND BRITISH 
WORLDS 
Analyze the changes in the ideas and daily lives of the people in British North America in 
the 1700s as a result of events within and beyond the colonies. 
In 1706–07, the English and Scottish Parliaments passed the Act of Union , formally 
uniting England and Scotland to create Great Britain. Although the two countries 
had been ruled by a single monarch since James I came to the throne in 1603, they 
were separate nations with separate Parliaments, and the American colonies were 
English colonies. Aft er 1707, England and Scotland were one country, and the English 
colonies became British North America. The act extended the political stability of 
the Glorious Revolution. By 1707, third and fourth generations of people living in 
the American colonies had never seen Britain, even though they were of English and

occasionally Scottish descent. Th ey were being joined by other Europeans, especially 
immigrants from Ireland and Germany along with increasing numbers of unwilling 
and unfree Africans. 
Th e British economy on both sides of the Atlantic was changing, and people were 
prospering. Although many people were still poor, the desperate starving time in 
Virginia and similar early struggles elsewhere were far behind. In British cities on both 
sides of the Atlantic and on the great plantations developing in the southern colonies, 
a growing social and economic elite lived comfortable lives, largely made possible by 
the slave trade and the backbreaking work of African slaves. Th e wealthiest colonial 
residents were those who lived on the tobacco, rice, and indigo plantations of Virginia 
and the Carolinas, including people like Charles and Anne Byrd Carter, whose families 
owned thousands of acres as well as many slaves and produced some of the goods most 
in demand in Great Britain and Britain’s other colonies around the world. 
Nevertheless, colonial life was still full of uncertainty. Th e hysteria that led to the 
Salem witch trials in the 1690s refl ected these deep-seated fears that were just under 
the surface of much of colonial society. Rural women were oft en isolated, and even 
urban women were confi ned to domestic worlds, which could be boring and lonely. 
Fears and uncertainties were oft en shaped by information about events that took place 
in another colony. The ever-present danger of Indian raids continued to threaten 
British colonies, just as raids by settlers were a constant danger for tribes living near 
the colonies. Th e wealthy elite, whose wealth depended on slaves, feared slave revolts. 
In addition, wars in Europe oft en led to battles in North America. 
By the early 1700s, England was the world’s dominant sea power, bringing great 
fi nancial benefi ts to those who controlled the trade in goods and people across the 
Atlantic and bringing prosperity to those who lived in port cities on both sides of the 
ocean. As trade and prosperity grew, the quest for commercial success began to replace 
religious devotion as the prime focus of many people’s lives. 
The Salem Witch Trials of 1692 
Underlying tensions in colonial life surfaced in Massachusetts during the harsh, 
unrelenting winter of 1691–92. The residents of Salem and the surrounding 
Massachusetts communities also lived in fear because New England was under siege 
from Indians allied with French Canada. In midwinter, Indians killed 50 residents of 
York, Maine, and took another hundred hostage. Residents of other Maine communities 
fled in terror and were living in or near Salem. Exiles from Maine may have been 
especially traumatized, but all of the residents feared further attacks. Moreover, other 
As their dress and the picture’s background illustrate, Charles and Anne Byrd Carter of Virginia were among 
the colonial elite when these pictures were painted in the 1730s.

106 Part II Settlements Old and New, 1607–1754 
tensions were brewing in the port city of Salem. Many poorer residents resented their 
neighbors who formed a more prosperous commercial elite. In addition, women in 
Salem, like in all English colonies, lived, oft en unwillingly, within strict submissive 
gender roles; women who were unusually assertive, especially women who lived alone 
or were of non-English backgrounds, were not trusted. 
As these tensions simmered, Salem fell into a kind of mass hysteria late that winter. 
Two young girls in the home of the Reverend Samuel Parris of Salem Village—his 
daughter Betty and her cousin Abigail—began to suff er fi ts. Th ey seemed to be “bitten 
and pinched by invisible agents.” Th e town doctor wondered if their disease might be 
a result of witchcraft . In March, the girls accused Tituba, the family’s Indian slave, of 
bewitching them. Th us began the Salem witch trials , one of the best-known episodes 
of mass hysteria in the English colonies. 
Soon other young women came forward with tales similar to those of Betty and 
Abigail. As a result, formal charges were brought, and court proceedings began. In 
time, some of those accused, including Tituba, “confessed” to being witches. Witnesses 
turned against one another, and convictions for witchcraft became common. 
Between February 1692 and May 1693, legal action was taken against 
144 people—106 women and 38 men. Six men and 14 women, including Tituba, were 
executed. Th at so many people in Salem believed their illnesses and troubles were the 
work of witches was not strange in the 1600s. Most people in Europe believed that 
there were witches—people who had made a compact with the devil and could appear 
as ghosts and make other people and animals sick. Hundreds of supposed witches 
were executed in England in that century, and many other accusations of witchcraft 
had surfaced in New England, although never on the scale of what happened in Salem. 
In Salem, the whole community became involved as the accusations spread quickly 
from one household to another. Virtually all of the accusers were young women under 
age 25, and most of the victims were also women—though oft en older. 
The hysteria ended almost as quickly as it had begun. By the fall of 1692, 
Massachusetts authorities—clergy and political leaders—were starting to have doubts 
about the trials and executions. Most people in the colony probably still believed in 
witchcraft , but they were increasingly uneasy about what was happening in Salem. By 
spring 1693, it was all over. One of the judges, Samuel Sewall, publicly apologized for 
his role and asked God’s pardon. Reverend Parris was forced to leave Salem, and the 
Massachusetts authorities voted compensation for victims and families. Th e Salem 
witch trials were one of the last times that people were executed for explicitly religious 
reasons in North America. 
Women’s Lives 
By the middle of the 1700s, the white culture of British North America was generally 
divided between the public and private realms. Because women were generally 
relegated to the private realm, many of them lived cut off from society. 
Urban women had much more opportunity for social contact with other women 
and men than those living in more isolated regions. In Williamsburg, Virginia, two 
women—Anne Shields and Jane Vobe—both ran their own taverns. Mary Channing 
ran a large store in Boston, and Lydia Hyde had her own shop in Philadelphia. 
While these women may have been the exception, city women did have many 
opportunities to interact. 
However, more than 90 percent of the of the British residents of North America 
lived on farms, sometimes very isolated farms, and the lives of rural women could be 
frighteningly lonely. In more settled communities, especially in southern New England, 
women could oft en fi nd limited contact with other women in ways that allowed them 
to build some friendships, such as gathering to trade soap, candles, cheese, and butter 
or attending church. Growing commercial prosperity also meant that some women 
were able to purchase imported goods including tea, china, and—for a few—even silk.

Chapter 4 Creating the Culture of British North America 107 
As the American population expanded, finding land often required moving 
to more isolated rural areas, which could make contact and community life more 
diffi cult, especially for women. While male farmers also lived very isolated lives, they 
traveled to town to sell goods and buy necessities more oft en than women. Th ese trips 
provided men far more opportunity to meet neighbors and participate in the social 
and political discussions. In contrast, women were limited not only by assumptions 
that they should stick to household matters and leave political discussion and trade 
to their husbands but also by the physical demands of pregnancy, birth, nursing, and 
child rearing as well as by the daily chores of a farm—taking care of the animals, 
raising the vegetables, preserving food, preparing meals, spinning wool, weaving 
cloth, and making clothes. 
Women’s work also included playing the role of physician or pharmacist 
because most farm families did not have access to more formal medical care. 
Women had to be familiar with medical information and herbal medicines. 
Manuals such as Aristotle’s Complete Masterpiece: Displaying the Secrets of Nature 
in the Generation of Man provided many women with detailed information on sexual 
matters, childbirth, and child rearing. In addition, the opportunities women 
had to share medical and child-rearing information, provide medical care, and 
support each other through medical emergencies and childbirth were extremely 
important to women’s community life. Midwives and healers had special status, 
but any nearby farm wife might be summoned to attend a birth, and a woman in 
labor might well have six to 10 female attendants. Th e times surrounding a birth 
were an important social occasion as women had time to sew, tell stories, and catch 
up with each other. 
At the bottom of the social hierarchy were enslaved women. For women living in 
slavery, the usual gender distinctions of white society had less meaning. On farms and 
plantations, male and female slaves all worked long hours in the fi elds. In urban areas, 
where there might be greater gender distinctions in specifi c forms of work, enslaved 
women were still aff orded little of the protections that were expected—if not always 
enforced—for white women. 
There were, of course, exceptions to the general isolation that women living 
outside of cities experienced. Eliza Lucas (1722–1793) was born to a wealthy 
English sugar-growing family on the island of Antigua in 1722. She was educated in 
London and then joined her family in South Carolina in 1738. She quickly became 
a popular member of Charleston’s elite. However, in 1739, war between England 
and Spain required her father to return to Antigua. She was left in charge of three 
Carolina plantations at the age of 16. In 1744, Eliza married Charles Pinckney. He 
also traveled a great deal and left her in charge of the plantations. Like male plantation 
owners, Eliza Pinckney supervised a large labor force of slaves whose labor 
was the basis of her wealth and leisure. Her position gave her time and opportunity 
to develop her agricultural ideas and cultivate her intellect, which she did 
throughout her life. She experimented with new crops and crop rotations. She also 
helped develop cultivation of the indigo plant, which was used to create a blue dye 
that was popular in England and which soon rivaled rice as a source of wealth in 
South Carolina. 
The Growth of Cities: Philadelphia, New York, Boston, Charleston 
In 1700, British North America had a population of approximately 250,000, 
including both Europeans and Africans, but not Indians. Boston was the largest 
city in the colonies with 8,000 inhabitants, followed by New York City with 6,000. 
Philadelphia and Charleston were both under 3,000, but Philadelphia was growing 
fast. By contrast, the capital of New Spain, Mexico City, had 100,000 residents, 
and London had over 500,000 in 1700. With growing trade and prosperity, the 
British North American population would dramatically increase (see Table 4-1 ).

4.3 

108 Part II Settlements Old and New, 1607–1754 
By the 1770s, on the eve of the American Revolution, Philadelphia would have 30,000 
residents, followed by New York with 25,000, Boston with 16,000, and Charleston 
with 12,000. Th e total colonial population would be 2.5 million, including 500,000 
slaves of African origin. 
Many colonists responded to the growing trade and prosperity with pride in being 
part of the British Empire. In the 1690s, Virginia moved its capital from Jamestown 
to Williamsburg, complete with a new capitol building that refl ected this pride. Th e 
structure had two wings—one for the elected legislature, the House of Burgesses, 
and one for the royally appointed council—just as the Parliament that sat in London 
had places for the elected House of Commons and the hereditary House of Lords. 
The governor’s elegant Williamsburg residence reflected the status of the crown’s 
representative in the colony. 
Although most people still lived on farms or in small towns, the port cities were 
becoming significant centers of trade and culture for the whole British Empire. 
Between 1701 and 1754, the cities of British North America moved from being rude 
outposts to cities that looked and felt very much like similar cities in Britain. Th ey were 
important to the British Empire’s commercial and maritime success, and residents 
were proud of their connection to the mother country. 
In the early 1700s, New York City, Philadelphia, Boston, and Charleston all 
emerged as signifi cant trading centers for the British world. Th e ocean-based commerce 
of these cities was based on their good harbors, Britain’s growing dominance of 
the world’s oceans, and industries that included Britain’s naval building, the tea trade, 
and the slave trade. Ships based in North America carried food— cornmeal, pork, 
and beef—and naval stores—tar, pitch turpentine, lumber—to the great sugar plantations 
of the British West Indies. Th ese prosperous plantations on Barbados, Jamaica, 
and other British-controlled islands were far richer than anything on the mainland 
of North America. Th ey also had many more slaves than any plantation on the mainland. 
But they depended on outsiders, often colonists living on the vast mainland 
of North America, to supply their food and building supplies. Th e ships returned to 
North American ports with slaves, sugar, rum, molasses, cotton, and fruit from the 
Caribbean; manufactured goods from Great Britain; and letters of credit that expanded 
the cash in circulation in the colonies and in London. 
Cities also became safer places to live after Boston clergyman Cotton Mather 
championed the first vaccinations against smallpox in 1721. While smallpox had 
been a major cause of death among Indians who had never developed immunity to 
the disease, many Europeans also died of it. Mather, a Puritan theologian and pastor, 
was also an acute scientifi c observer. He had read about a Turkish doctor who had 
produced light cases of smallpox by deliberately infecting healthy people with the 
disease, which produced immunity in them against more lethal strains. 
When the smallpox epidemic of 1721 hit Boston, Mather advocated using that 
doctor’s inoculation approach, and a physician, Zabdiel Boylston, tried it. Mather collected 
the statistics. Of some 300 people inoculated, only fi ve or six died compared 
with 900 deaths among the 5,000 who were not inoculated. Th e statistics were compelling. 
Smallpox inoculations spread throughout the colonial world though it was 
another 30 years before smallpox inoculations were common in England.

Chapter 4 Creating the Culture of British North America 109 
Benjamin Franklin (1706–1790) was born in modest circumstances 
in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1706. At age 12, after 2 years of 
schooling, Franklin became an apprentice—an indentured servant— 
to his older brother, James, a printer in Boston. In 1723, at the age of 
17—and 4 years before his indenture expired—Benjamin took advantage 
of a loophole in the contract and left Boston for Philadelphia. By 
1729, at the age of 23 he was sole owner of a printing business having 
bought out a partner. While he made money printing government 
documents and publications for private businesses, Franklin 
also produced Poor Richard’s Almanack that predicted the weather for 
the coming year and shared friendly advice. By 1748, when he was 42 
years old, Franklin, with his flourishing printing business, was one of 
the richest people in the northern colonies and decided that it was time 
to retire from work, live the life of a gentleman, and devote himself to 
public service. Public service had always been important to Franklin, 
and it was a measure of the status he sought. He had already helped 
launch the Library Company of Philadelphia. Soon after he retired, 
Franklin engaged in his famous experiment with a kite to prove that 
lighting was, indeed, electricity. In 1755 he helped found the College 
of Philadelphia that would become the University of Pennsylvania. In 
1757, Franklin wrote a preface to the last edition of his almanac he had 
published for 30 years. He used a fictional Father Abraham to quote all 
of the best passages that he had written over the years. This preface 
was subsequently published as The Way to Wealth , one of Franklin’s 
most enduring works, which reflected a growing emphasis on financial 
success. The advice from Poor Richard shed light on a changing 
colonial culture, one in which religious orthodoxy and national 
loyalties mattered less and individual commercial success mattered 
much more. 
I stopped my horse lately where a great number of people 
were collected at a vendue [sale] of merchant goods. The hour of 
sale not being come, they were conversing on the badness of the 
times, and one of the company called to a plain, clean old man 
with white locks: “Pray, Father Abraham, what think you of the 
times? Won’t these heavy taxes quite ruin the country? How shall 
we be ever able to pay them? What would you advise us to?… 
“Friends,” says he, “and neighbors, the taxes are indeed very 
heavy, and if those laid on by the government were the only 
ones we had to pay, we might more easily discharge them; but 
we have many others, and much more grievous to some of us. 
We are taxed twice as much by our idleness, three times as much 
by our pride, and four times as much by our folly; and from these 
taxes the commissioners cannot ease or deliver us by allowing an 
abatement. However, let us hearken to good advice, and something 
may be done for us; ‘God helps them that help themselves,’ 
as Poor Richard says in his almanac of 1733.… 
“’If time be of all things the most precious, wasting time must 
be,’ as Poor Richard says, ‘the greatest prodigality’; since as he 
elsewhere tells us, ‘Lost time is never found again’; …and ‘Early to 
bed and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise.’… 
Diligence is the mother of good luck,’ as Poor Richard says…and 
‘By diligence and patience the mouse ate in two the cable’; and 
‘Little strokes fell great oaks,’ as Poor Richard says in his almanac— 
the year I cannot just now remember… 
“And now to conclude, ‘Experience keeps a dear school, but 
fools will learn in no other, and scarce in that’; for it is true, ‘We may 
give advice, but we cannot give conduct,’ as Poor Richard says…” 
Thus the old gentleman ended his harangue. The people 
heard it and approved the doctrine, and immediately practiced 
the contrary, just as if it had been a common sermon.

Commercial Attitudes, Commercial Success—Mercantilism 
and the New Trading Economy 
Th e economy of Europe and Europe’s American colonies changed drastically between 
1689 and 1754. Since at least the time of Queen Elizabeth, the western world’s economy, 
and certainly the economy of Britain and Britain’s possessions, had been organized 
around an economic system known as mercantilism . But as trade developed in the 
colonies, the seeds of what would later be described in 1776 as capitalism were already 
taking hold. Advocates of mercantilism believed that economic transactions should 
be directed to increase the nation’s wealth without regard for other participants in 
mercantilism 
Economic system whereby the government 
intervenes in the economy for the purpose of 
increasing national wealth. 
capitalism 
Economic system best described by Adam 
Smith in 1776 in which trade is seen as the 
source of wealth rather than as exchange 
of goods themselves; as a result, wealth can 
continually expand as trade expands.

those transactions, that the world’s wealth was fi nite, and that for any nation to grow 
in wealth some other nation needed to be the loser. Using this mercantile approach, 
the British Empire closely guarded the colonies so that their wealth went exclusively 
to Britain and not to other European countries. Economists of the time believed that 
it was critical that the colonies be used only to produce raw materials that would 
enrich the European nation that claimed them and that colonies also consume manufactured 
products from their mother country. Any trade outside of this closed loop, 
they claimed, ran the risk of diluting the nation’s wealth. As the later idea of capitalism 
emerged, advocates for that concept saw the economic world very differently. 
Economists who favored capitalism believed there was no limit to the world’s wealth 
because it was trade, not the goods that were being traded, that was the ultimate key 
to wealth. Th us, trade between individuals and between nations allowed continuing 
growth for all parties. 
The prime example of mercantilism in the Americas were the British 
Navigation Acts of 1650 and 1660. Th e 1660 Navigation Act proclaimed that, “from 
thenceforward, no goods or commodities whatsoever shall be imported into or 
exported out of any lands, islands, plantations, or territories to his Majesty belonging 
or in his possession…but in such ships or vessels as do truly and without fraud belong 
only to the people of England or Ireland, dominion of Wales or town of Berwick 
upon Tweed.” In other words, anything shipped to North America or to other British 
colonies had to be transported in English ships, and everything shipped from the 
colonies had to be transported in English ships bound for England. Th e goal was clear: 
the colonies would produce raw goods—as the act stipulated, “sugars, tobacco, cottonwool, 
indigoes, ginger, fustic, or other dyeing wood”—and ship them only to England. 
England would produce manufactured goods, and the colonies would be limited to 
buying goods only from England. Th e arrangement was a closed economic system, 
and it was designed to ensure that wealth from the colonies fl owed only to London, 
not back to the colonies and certainly not to any other country. Clearly, Britain had no 
interest in cultivating wealth within the colonies themselves. 
Th e problem with mercantilism was that it focused too much on control of things 
and too little on the trade of things. Th e eff orts on the part of Spain to maintain its 
wealth by controlling the world’s supply of silver and gold are illustrative of that 
problem as was the eff ort of British pirates to steal the same gold. Many European 
wars of the era were fought over issues related to mercantilism as each European 
power sought to control the greatest amount of what they saw as the world’s 
limited wealth. As the Navigation Acts made clear, for much of the 1700s, even 
as Britain itself was beginning to focus on developing an economy based on trade, 
its government attempted to use mercantile principles to control that trade with the 
American colonies. 
The Triangle Trade that developed in response to British mercantile policies 
involved the shipment of slaves from Africa to the West Indies and North America in 
exchange for rum (see Map 4-4 ). Sugar and rum (made from sugar) were also shipped 
to Britain, and goods manufactured in Britain were shipped to Africa, the West Indies, 
and to the mainland of North America. But there was also signifi cant trade directly 
between North America and Britain. Raw materials, including fur, grain, tobacco, 
rice, and indigo—the last three all produced by slave labor—were shipped directly 
to Britain in return for manufactured products that by law—though not always in 
reality—could be produced only in Great Britain. 
For British colonists living in North America, the trade problems were more real 
life than theoretical. Th ey hated mercantilism and the Navigation Acts, not because 
they opposed slavery or the introduction of slave labor into the colonies or because 
they thought capitalism was a better economic theory, but because the British policies 
were keeping them from getting rich. Molasses could be bought more cheaply from 
French colonies than from British. Slaves could sometimes be bought more cheaply

1700s in which slaves from Africa were sent 
to the West Indies and mainland North 
America while goods and other resources 
were shipped between the West Indies and 
North America and Britain.

As colonial life became more settled in British 
North America between the 1680s and the 1750s, 
economic patterns became more established. 
In the early 1700s a British study reported the 
kinds of trades practiced in the colonies, including 
this illustration of a male master and apprentice 
working in a shop. 

Chapter 4 Creating the Culture of British North America 111 
from Dutch traders than from English. Similarly, goods produced in the colonies— 
tobacco, rice, food stuff s and ships stores—could oft en fetch higher prices elsewhere 
in the world than in Britain. Trading with a wider world, especially the rich colonies 
of the Caribbean, made more sense and produced greater profi t than limiting trade to 
England alone. 
Circumventing the Navigation Acts, either through finding legal loopholes or 
simply sailing off in a diff erent direction than British laws allowed, became a major 
enterprise and source of wealth throughout all of the British colonies. Th e involvement 
of the colonies in worldwide trade—even when that trade was illegal—foreshadowed 
not only American independence but also a shift in economic systems from the closed 
world of mercantilism to a more open and elastic world in which trade and commerce, 
rather than simply ownership of things, was the key to wealth. 
Trade was also increasing the exchange of information. Cotton Mather learned 
about smallpox inoculations from Turkish physicians through contacts in London. 
New York’s traders interacted with merchants in Jamaica and Barbados as well as 
Africa and England. Jews whose forbearers had been exiled from Spain mingled on 
the streets of New York and Philadelphia with Africans captured from Kongo and 
servants fl eeing poverty in London. News of attacks by Indians allied with France or 
Spain sparked uncertainty, even hysteria, among colonists. Slaves from the Carolinas

MAP 4-4 The Triangle Trade. As this map shows, the so-called triangular trade was not a perfect triangle. 
But for the British colonies the most signifi cant trade focused on England from which manufactured products 
were shipped to the Americas and to Africa. In return African slaves were shipped to the Caribbean and to 
North America, Caribbean rum was shipped to Africa and to England, and raw materials— including fi sh, fur, 
grain, rice, indigo, and tobacco—were shipped directly from North America to England which, according to 
mercantile laws, was the only place where raw materials could be turned into fi nished manufactured goods.

heard about offers from Spanish Florida and escaped to freedom. And as the next 
section in this chapter relates, the most infl uential preacher of the Great Awakening, 
George Whitefield, traveled back and forth across the Atlantic 13 times, preaching 
transformative sermons to huge crowds in England and America. Th ese kinds of 
exchanges gave many people new knowledge of a wider world. Although the world 
of British North America could be limited and most people did not travel very far, 
colonial society was very much an international society—a context that shaped the life 
of every British North American resident in the mid-1700s. 
At the same time, trade, travel, and communication among the colonies grew, even 
though London tried to tighten its control and its separate connections with each of 
the 13 mainland British colonies. People along the Atlantic Coast, from New England 
to the Carolinas, began to take greater notice of one another, exchanging ideas and 
seeing new reasons to defend their common interests. By the 1750s, colonists were 
identifying some of those common interests even as they jealously guarded their 
own colony’s independence. Th e years between 1707 and 1754 were years of relative 
stability in British North America, but they were also years in which the availability 
of information, attitudes and opinions about the value of British political power in 
colonial life changed dramatically. 
Changing Social Systems 
As the economic systems gradually shifted, starting in the 1730s, social systems 
in British North America also began to change, refl ecting those economic trends. 
Although society in North America was not as highly stratifi ed as in Britain itself, the 
strong sense of social class had been growing since the late 1600s. Among the many 
social gradations in British North America, those at the top believed that there were 
really only two social classes in the early to mid-1700s. A small class of gentlemen 
and ladies, who did not have to work for a living, were on top. Gentlemen and ladies 
might engage in public service, and the gentlemen might sit in legislative assemblies 
or engage in certain professions, but they did so as a sign of their social status 
and not because they needed the money. Below that elite group, separated by a great 
gulf, were those who had to work for a living—farmers and tradespeople known 
as “mechanics” and, below them, the servants and slaves. However prosperous 
the mechanics and farmers might become, they were still stigmatized. Th ey were 
expected to know their place and maintain proper deference to society’s elite. At 
the very bottom were those in varying degrees of unfreedom—slaves, indentured 
servants, or simply desperately poor people. Members of this group were disregarded 
in terms of having any say or infl uence. People in these classes typically acknowledged 
duty to those above them and deference to those below. Th e notion of society 
as a hierarchy was commonplace. 
By the 1720s, however, some of the mechanics and farmers were beginning to 
recognize a new social class: the “middling sorts.” Th ese prosperous working people 
earned their success through hard work and frugality, both of which the elite scorned. 
Over generations, this group would evolve into what we now call the middle class. 
The middling social class, including printers, most physicians, small farmers, and 
those who sailed on ships, diff erentiated themselves from working people in the less 
prosperous trades and the servants and slaves. A new perspective was taking shape. 
People began to question the notion of a society that expected deference to those of 
higher status. The assumption that one stayed in the class to which one was born 
was quickly disappearing. Benjamin Franklin, though much more successful than 
most, was far from the only resident of colonial America to move from one class to 
another. Of course, social movement was not the only in an upward direction. As class 
roles weakened, some also moved downward or moved outside of the class system 
altogether, such as the most famous outlaw of the mid-1700s, Th omas Bell.

A Changing Religious Landscape—From the Halfway 
Covenant to the First Great Awakening 
With the first settlement in British North America, there was a sense that somehow 
this new land was a divinely planned opportunity to begin the world again and 
make it right. In 1702, Cotton Mather, perhaps the best known minister in Boston 
at the time, published a highly romanticized religious history of New England that 
confi rmed this sense. Th e book refl ected a theme that would be repeated throughout 
American history, the belief that the country had a special divine mission to 
fulfi ll. Mather praised God that Europe had made contact with the Americas aft er 
the Protestant Reformation so British North America was being built by Protestants 
and not by Roman Catholics. At the same time, some Catholics saw their mission 
from the opposite side of the Reformation divide. Giovanni Botero wrote in 1595 
that it was only divine providence that led the kings of France and England to reject 
overtures from Columbus so that his initial “discovery” could be made while sailing 
for Catholic Spain.

If one depended on colonial newspapers rather than on the 
work of subsequent historians, then the best-known American 
of the first half of the 1700s was not Benjamin Franklin or 
Jonathan Edwards (see next section on religion) but Thomas Bell. 
The February 10, 1743, issue of Benjamin Franklin’s newspaper 
the Pennsylvania Gazette describes Bell’s renown: 
He has it seems made it his business for several 
years to travel from Colony to Colony, personating 
diff erent People, forging Bills of Credit, &c. and 
frequently pretending Distress, imposed grossly on 
the charitable and compassionate. 
This “famous American traveler” was known for his thefts, 
swindles, and escapes in Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, 
Virginia, Maryland, the Carolinas, and island colonies including 
Barbados and Jamaica. 
Bell was about the same age as Benjamin Franklin or Jonathan 
Edwards. Born in Boston in 1713, he attended Harvard College 
but was expelled because he “stole a cake of chocolate…has 
been guilty of the most notorious, complicated lying.” He quickly 
left town. In 1738, he was arrested in Williamsburg, Virginia, 
and again in New York City, “for falsely, unlawfully, unjustly, 
knowingly, fraudulently, and deceitfully, composing, writing, 
and inventing a false, fictitious, Counterfeit, and invented Letter.” 
A year after his arrests in Williamsburg and New York, Bell 
sparked a riot between Jewish and Christian communities in 
Barbados when, pretending to be the son of the governor of 
Massachusetts, he got himself invited to a Jewish wedding. 
During the celebration, he was caught pilfering the family’s 
goods. Bell denied the obvious theft and appealed to the 
Christian community to defend him, setting off a Christian 
attack on Jews. 
Two years later in the summer of 1741, Bell stopped at a 
tavern in Princeton, New Jersey. When he was mistaken for the 
Reverend John Rowland, a Presbyterian minister, Bell sensed an 
opportunity and offered to preach at the Presbyterian Church. 
Just before Sunday services, he rifled the goods in his host’s 
home, stole his horse, and departed. When the real Rowland 
returned to New Jersey, the famous minister was arrested for the 
theft, and it took a considerable time before the Supreme Court 
of New Jersey cleared up the matter of the mistaken identities. 
After several more daring escapades, Bell met his end in 
Kingston, Jamaica, where in 1771 he was hung for piracy. Bell’s 
story and mark in history has faded with time, but it represents 
a part of the story of America’s people that has continued 
throughout American history, including outlaws in the West and 
gangsters in the 1900s. 
Thinking Critically 
1. Contextualization 
How would you explain Bell’s fame during his own lifetime? 
Why might his successful acts of impersonation have captured 
the imagination of the colonial public? 
2. Historical Interpretation

does his story tell us about the role of newspapers in colonial 
popular culture?

Not all Europeans accepted their mission as a special part of divine providence, however. 
Roger Williams, who led Rhode Island as a haven for religious tolerance, insisted 
that God did not choose special elect nations—not England and not New England. A 
group of settlers in northern New England reminded one missionary who spoke of 
their divine mission, “Sir,…our main end is to catch fi sh.” Nevertheless, by the early 
1700s, the notion that America was part of a divine drama of salvation was widespread. 
By the early 1700s, however, the sense of being on a divine mission had declined 
among many colonists. Th e grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the original 
Puritan settlers were living increasingly comfortable lives in the commercially prosperous 
British Empire. Religious fervor and religious conversions were less and less 
common, and many were much more tolerant of the growing religious diversity in 
all of the colonies. Th is growth of religious toleration in the 1700s—something not 
imagined in the 1600s—prompted more Europeans to come to the British colonies in 
search of religious freedom that they could not fi nd in their homelands. 
Increasingly, more of those who already lived in the colonies began to consider 
alternatives to the religious dogmas of their parents and communities. Th e growth 
of new philosophical ideas in Europe led many intellectuals, and eventually more 
and more people in general, to look more to science and human reason than to faith 
in trying to understand their world. Th ey called the time in which they were living 
the Age of Enlightenment . Some in this period rejected all religious teachings, while 
others simply placed less emphasis on matters of faith and more on reason. In the 
colonies as in Europe, some people began to take religion with a large grain of salt, 
being convinced by Enlightenment philosophies that most religious matters were 
mere superstitions that were, at best, unprovable by the scientifi c tools of the new 
age. Some simply turned their attentions to other matters. 
Describing his travels in Pennsylvania between 1750 and 1754, the German 
Protestant minister Gottlieb Mittelberger described a scene not at all to his liking: 
We find there Lutherans, Reformed, Catholics, Quakers, Mennonists or 
Anabaptists, Herrnhuters or Moravian Brethren, Pietists, Seventh-Day 
Baptists, Dunkers, Presbyterians, Newborn, Freemasons, Separatists, 
Freethinkers, Jews, Mohammedans, Pagans, Negroes, and Indians.…Many 
pray neither in the morning or in the evening, neither before nor aft er meals. 
No devotional book, not to speak of a Bible, will be found with such people. 
Mittelberger may have been happy to leave Pennsylvania and return to his ministry 
in Germany. However, while many ministers expressed similar worries about a religious 
decline in the colonies in the early 1700s, especially New England, other 
preachers sought ways to release religious energy. Prompting some of these religious 
stirrings were the sermons of Solomon Stoddard, who served as the minister of the 
Congregational church in Northampton, Massachusetts, and who had been one of 
the authors of the Halfway Covenant. By the 1720s, Stoddard’s sermons were leading 
to a resurgence of religion not only in Northampton but also in much of western 
Massachusetts and Connecticut. 
Stoddard’s grandson and successor, Jonathan Edwards (1703–1758), became 
famous for leading even larger religious revivals. Edward’s sermons in western 
Massachusetts, like those of John Wesley in England, led many to report that their 
“hearts were strangely warmed” and that they were experiencing a new sense of divine 
presence. Th e First Great Awakening , a series of religious revivals that swept all of the 
North American colonies in the late 1730s had begun. Word of the awakening spread 
quickly across the colonies as well as Great Britain and the rest of Europe. 
Edwards prided himself on preaching in a low voice and seeking to convert 
people solely by the power of the logic of his words. He rejected any anti- intellectual 
religion as “heat without light.” Although the revivals led by Edwards and others of 
his day resulted in a signifi cant emotional release for many, they were nothing like 
the revivals of later times. If there was music, it was not central, and sermons were

designed to be long rational arguments for the importance of changing one’s life 
that depended less on the preacher’s charisma than any ability to persuade. But by 
the 1730s, these logical sermons were creating their own dramatic results. Many in 
Edwards’s congregation were undergoing deeply emotional conversion experiences 
while listening to his sermons, taking religion seriously in a way that they never had 
before. In a short period of time, 300 conversions were reported, increasing church 
membership considerably. 
For Jonathan Edwards, the purpose of revival preaching was to convince 
individuals of their sinfulness and move them through an emotional catharsis of 
conversion to a new life and a new relationship to God. In perhaps his best known 
sermon, Edwards said, “The God that holds you over the pit of hell, much as one 
holds a spider, or some loathsome insect, over the fi re, abhors you, and is dreadfully 
provoked; his wrath towards you burns like fi re…yet it is nothing but his hand that 
holds you from falling into the fi re every moment.” Edwards was urgently pleading 
with his hearers to rethink the direction of their lives. 
Later in the 1730s, George Whitefield (1714–1770) became the most powerful 
preacher of the Great Awakening. Whitefield lived in Britain but preached to 
huge audiences in both Britain and North America. His fi rst trip to North America 
began in Georgia in 1738. In 1739 and 1740, he crossed the Atlantic again, making a 
preaching tour that started in Georgia, moved through the middle colonies (including 
Philadelphia, where his preaching deeply impressed Benjamin Franklin who became 
a lifelong friend if not a convert), and progressed to Boston where huge audiences 
attended a series of sermons, including one on Boston Common that drew a crowd 
of 30,000 listeners. Whitefi eld also visited Northampton and preached at Edwards’s 
church to great acclaim. 
Whitefi eld had high regard for Edwards and Presbyterian ministers like Gilbert 
Tennent. He had a much lower opinion of the majority of preachers and said that, “the 
reason why congregations have been so dead, is because dead men preach to them.” 
Timothy Cutler, an Episcopal priest in Boston, responded by describing Whitefi eld’s 
sermons as “his beastly brayings.” 
Cutler was not the only minister to resist the emotionalism of Whitefield and 
Edwards. The leaders at Harvard and Yale did not like the revivalists whom they 
saw as emotional and divisive. Churches were split. The Presbyterian Church 
was split into New Light (pro-Awakening) and Old Light (anti-Awakening) bodies. 
Many Congregational churches were split, and towns that had supported 
one church for much of the past century now supported two, or three, or even 
four. In contrast, the Baptists, who generally sided with the Awakening, grew 
dramatically. 
The Great Awakening changed American society. Many who had previously 
shown little interest in religion became converted. Many who thought of themselves 
as deeply religious now saw their faith in more emotional and ethical 
terms. The revivals of the Great Awakening cut across many of the traditional 
divides of class and race, even gender. While more women than men responded 
to the religious energy, some of the rules segregating classes and races seem to 
have been suspended for these revivals. Africans—slave and free—and American 
Indians were also converted and became enthusiastic members of religious bodies. 
Samson Occom, a Mohegan Indian from Connecticut, was a convert in the 
Awakening who went on to be a revival leader, preaching to white and Native 
American audiences. 
Th e Awakening transformed American higher education, which at that time was 
closely connected to the churches. Harvard resisted the movement while Yale, fi rst 
split by it, eventually moved into the Awakening camp. Prorevival ministers founded 
Dartmouth—initially meant to serve American Indians—and Princeton to support the 
revival cause and help prepare a new generation of revival-oriented ministers.

In his book, A Treatise Concerning Religious Affections, published in 
1746 after the Great Awakening had run its course, Edwards asked a 
fundamental question about any religious experience, “How does one 
judge if it is real or not?” He answered that the key was found in the way 
a person lived. Edwards believed that a person who did not live out what 
religious truths he or she claimed to believe surely signaled that his or 
her religious experience was not sincere. 
What is the nature of true religion?…Gracious and holy 
affections have their exercise and fruit in Christian practice. 
I mean, they have that influence and power upon him who is the 
subject of ‘em, that they cause that a practice, which is universally 
conformed to, and directed by Christian rules, should be the practice 
and business of his life.…Slothfulness in the service of God, in 
his professed servants, is as damning, as open rebellion.…Christ 
nowhere says, ye shall know the tree by its leaves or flowers, or 
ye shall know men by their talk, or ye shall know them by the 
good story they tell of their experiences, or ye shall know them by 
the manner and air of their speaking, and emphasis and pathos 
of expression, or by their speaking feelingly, or by making a very 
great show by abundance of talk, or by many tear and affectionate 
expressions, or by the affections ye feel in your heart towards 
them: but by their fruits you shall know them.…“Let your light 
so shine before men, that others seeing your good works, may 
glorify your Father which is in heaven” (Matt. 5:16).…Hypocrites 
may much more easily be brought to talk like saints, than to act 
like saints.…There may be several good evidences that a tree is 
a fig tree; but the highest and most proper evidence of it, is that 
it actually bears figs.…[W]e should get into the way of appearing 
lively in religion, more by being lively in the service of God and our 
generation, than by the liveliness and forwardness of our tongues.

Jonathan Edwards, A Treatise Concerning Religious Affections 
Ongoing Wars in Europe and British North America 
Between 1689 and 1815, England and France were engaged in more or less continual 
war with each other for control of global empires. Spain was oft en allied with France in 
these wars. For those living in North America, each war involved not only international 
struggles but also local battles, especially with Indian tribes that were in their own 
shift ing alliances with European powers. From Europe’s perspective, the American 
Revolution itself could be seen as just one battle in that ongoing war. But long before 
the Revolution, colonial life in Britain’s colonies, as well as in colonies claimed by 
France and Spain, was shaped by these wars. 
France still claimed the St. Lawrence River Valley and the Mississippi Valley—an 
area spanning from what is now Minnesota to New Orleans. In 1724, Cadwallader 
Colden, a surveyor, reminded the governor of New York that, “the French plainly 
shew their intention of enclosing the British Settlements and cutting us off from all 
Commerce with the numerous Nations of Indians.” Despite the larger population 
of the British colonies, many colonists shared his fear that Britain’s colonies were 
encircled by French ones. Th ey also worried because Spain controlled Florida, many 
Caribbean islands, and the rich lands of Central and South America, giving Spain 
great power and wealth in its confrontations with Britain on both sides of the Atlantic. 
In addition, Indian tribes, many allied with the French, were often the dominant 
power in territory from western New York through Pennsylvania and into the western 
portions of the Carolinas and Georgia (see Map 4-5 ). 
It was not always clear who was winning and who was losing in the ongoing 
struggles, but war was a fact of daily life for much of the colonial era, sometimes 
devastatingly close to home and sometimes more generally refl ected in concerns about 
who would control the future of North America. When William and Mary came to 

Chapter 4 Creating the Culture of British North America 117 
the throne in England in 1689, King Louis XIV of France objected to their elevation 
by Parliament. Louis, a Catholic, had already fought William, a Protestant, in Holland, 
and now he did so again in what the British colonists called King William’s War. It 
lasted from 1689 to 1697. Th e war’s outcome was inconclusive, but the battles had devastating 
consequences for towns in the northern British colonies as Indian tribes who 
were allied with France attacked English settlements. It was as part of these battles 
that York, Maine, was attacked, sending residents fl eeing to Salem, Massachusetts, perhaps 
helping to provoke the Salem witch hysteria. European settlement of Maine was 
delayed for a generation. 
Soon aft er that war ended, another war began in Europe, the War of the Spanish 
Succession, over rival claimants to the Spanish throne, one of whom was strongly 
backed by France, which sought to tighten its alliance with Spain. Th e other claimant 
was supported by Britain, in part, because Britain greatly feared a strong French- 
Spanish alliance. The war lasted from 1701 to 1713. The British colonists in North 
America called this war Queen Anne’s War for the British monarch who ruled during 
this time. During this confl ict, major battles took place between Spanish and British

MAP 4-5 French, English, and Spanish Claims, 1608. Although it did not have the European population 
of the British colonies, New France, which was settled along the St. Lawrence River to the north and the 
Mississippi River to the west, was much larger than the British colonies. The large areas of land claimed by 
France along with the area of Florida claimed by Spain preventing British colonies from growing further and 
created hostile tensions.

forces in Florida and the Carolinas. In the same period, battles continued to erupt 
between French and British forces in Canada and New England, with various Indian 
tribes allied on all sides. In one attack, Indians who had allied with the French devastated 
the town of Deerfi eld, Massachusetts. 
As Britain, France, and Spain fought their wars in the 1600s, the fi ve nations of the 
Iroquois were fi rmly allied with the English against the French and France’s Indian 
allies. In 1689, a leader of the Mohawks—one of the fi ve Iroquois nations—said of his 
people that, “as they are one hand and soul with the English, they will take up the ax 
with pleasure against the French.” By the beginning of Queen Anne’s War, however, 
some Iroquois were beginning to believe that their alliance with the English meant 
that the Iroquois did all the fi ghting but received little in return. In 1701, Iroquois 
leaders signed a separate treaty of peace with the French that gave them new trading 
rights, especially at French-owned Detroit. 
For the next several decades, most of the Iroquois tried to keep clear of the 
continuing British-French tensions. Some Mohawks had different ideas, however. 
Despite their long alliance with the English, a group of Mohawks settled near Montreal 
in French Canada and converted to Catholicism. Among these settlements were also 
settlements of refugees from non-Iroquois tribes who had been defeated in King 
Philip’s War (1675–1676). Th ese refugees harbored an intense dislike of the English, 
especially the English in Massachusetts. Th ey and their Canadian-based Iroquois allies 
nurtured a desire to show their support for France and seek revenge on Massachusetts 
for the loss of Indian lives in King Philip’s War. 
In February 1704, Canadian-based Mohawks destroyed the town of Deerfield, 
Massachusetts, and a frontier outpost near the New York border. Fift y colonists were 
killed, and perhaps 70 more were taken captive. By the end of the day, the town was 
a burning ruin. Deerfi eld’s Congregational minister, Reverend John Williams, as well 
as his wife and remaining children, were taken hostage aft er one of the children was 
killed in the attack. His wife died on the forced march to Canada where the captives 
were taken. Eventually, Massachusetts offi cials ransomed Williams and most of the 
captives. Th e minister wrote an account of the attack and his captivity that became a 
best seller at the time. 
To the utter surprise of Rev. Williams and the Massachusetts offi cials, however, 
some of the Deerfi eld captives preferred to stay in Canada with the Mohawks. Among 
them was Eunice Williams, the minister’s daughter. She married a Mohawk, changed 
her name to A’ongote Gannenstenhawi, converted to Catholicism, and was the mother 
of three children raised in the Mohawk community. She lived a long life among her 
adopted community and died there in 1785 at the age of 95. 
Even when there were periods of relative peace among the European powers, 
Indian tribes fought their own battles with the colonists. As white settlement 
expanded in the Carolinas, the Tuscarora tribe began to resist. In 1711, the Tuscaroras 
captured a leader of Swiss and German immigrants, Christoph von Graffenried, 
and the Carolina surveyor-general, John Lawson. Graffenried was freed, but the 
Tuscarora executed Lawson. In response, the South Carolina authorities declared war 
on the Tuscarora and enlisted another tribe, the Yamasee, as their allies. Within 2 
years, most Tuscarora villages were burned, and a thousand of its tribe were killed. 
Th e remaining Tuscaroras moved west to avoid white settlement and, seeking further 
protection, affi liated with the Iroquois in 1722, enlarging the Iroquois League to six 
nations rather than fi ve. 
After the war, the Yamasee expected to be rewarded by the Carolina authorities 
for supporting their efforts. When no rewards were forthcoming, and when 
whites continued taking Yamasee as slaves, the Yamasee, in alliance with the Creeks, 
attacked Carolina plantations, killing settlers and traders in one of the bloodiest wars 
in colonial history. For a time, it was unclear whether the Carolina colony would survive, 
but offi cials sought an alliance with the powerful Cherokees, who had become 
dependent on trade with the British for the clothes and rifl es. Th e Cherokees quickly 
4.2 
4.1 
4.3 

Chapter 4 Creating the Culture of British North America 119 
defeated the Yamasees. Th ose Creeks and Yamasees who survived fl ed to Spanish 
Florida, leaving virtually no Yamasee or Creeks in the Carolinas. Th e British community 
also suff ered signifi cant loss of life in the Yamasee Wars, but it was clear they 
were the victors. 
In 1739, after 25 years of peace between the major European powers that held 
claims in North America, Britain and Spain again went to war—the so-called War 
of Jenkins’ Ear—when Spain claimed a right to search British ships in the Caribbean 
for contraband goods and Britain objected. (Th e odd nickname for the war referred 
to a British ship’s captain, Robert Jenkins, whose ear was cut off by a Spanish boarding 
party.) Th e British defeated Spain in this war, which confi rmed the dominance of 
British sea power in the Atlantic and Caribbean and made colonial trade with Britain 
and Britain’s Caribbean colonies much easier. 
Before the war of 1739 with Spain had ended, Britain and France were fi ghting 
again in the War of the Austrian Succession (referred to as King George’s War in 
North America). Much of New York and New England was engulfed in that war. Th e 
result, again, was modest victories and land transfers, but with considerable loss of life 
to British and French colonists and to their Indian allies. 
By 1754, another war erupted, known in Europe as the Seven Years’ War and in 
British North America as the French and Indian War. Unlike the previous wars, the 
British would be decisively victorious at the end of the French and Indian War in 1763 
(see Chapter 5 ) . However, the consequences of expanding the British Empire in North 
America would be signifi cant. 
The many wars between 1689 and 1763 (see Table 4-2 ) disrupted life in North 
America. Colonial militias were called up. Colonial shipping was attacked. Settlements 
of colonists and Indians were damaged or ruined. Indian alliances shift ed. Various 
tribes were either decimated or fl ed their homelands. Many colonists and Indians died, 
and for many of those who survived, life was far from secure. 
The Unifying Eff ects of the Wars on British Colonies 
During the many wars that took place in the 1700s, many English colonists developed 
a deep sense of patriotism to the British cause, oft en linked to an equally strong dislike 
of all things French and of the Indian nations allied with France. At the same

time, they came to realize that the British army was sometimes far away when it was 
most needed and that they needed to develop their own militias to protect themselves. 
Th e British monarchs were distracted by these wars and were inclined to neglect the 
colonies in the intervening years. As a result, colonial governments grew stronger and 
more independent through the early decades of the 1700s. 
For most of his life, Benjamin Franklin was a loyal subject of the British Empire. 
In 1754, Franklin wrote that his greatest desire was for the people of Great Britain 
and the people of Britain’s American colonies to “learn to consider themselves, not as 
belonging to diff erent Communities with diff erent Interests, but to one Community 
with one Interest.” In 1754 many colonists agreed with Franklin. 
By the early 1750s, it was clear to many who were living in British North America 
that the tension between England and France, which was playing out on both sides 
of the Atlantic, would soon lead to another war. In the early summer of 1754, several 
of the North American colonial governments appointed commissioners to meet in 
Albany, New York, to negotiate stronger mutual defense treaties with the Six Nations 
of the Iroquois and to discuss the common defense of the British colonies. Benjamin 
Franklin, who was chosen as one of Pennsylvania’s four commissioners, wanted far 
more. He arrived in Albany with a plan for “one general government [that] may be 
formed in America, including all the said colonies.” The particulars of the Albany 
Plan of Union , as it came to be known, included a provision that each colony would 
retain its own government, but that the new united colonies would be led by a council 
of representatives from the 13 colonies and a single “president general” appointed by 
the Crown. Th e unifi ed government would have authority to raise soldiers, build forts, 
and regulate trade with the Indians. It would help the 13 colonies realize Franklin’s 
Albany Plan of Union 
Plan put forward in 1754 by Massachusetts 
governor William Shirley, Benjamin Franklin, 
and other colonial leaders, calling for an 
intercolonial union to manage defense and 
Indian affairs. 
Even as late as 1774, Benjamin Franklin, shown here with members of Parliament, considered himself a loyal 
British subject, trying his best to reduce tensions between the colonies and the authorities in London. 
4.2

Chapter 4 Creating the Culture of British North America 121 
dream of being “one community with one interest” in relation to each other as well 
as to Great Britain. Franklin could not understand why the colonists couldn’t borrow 
an idea from the Six Nations of the Iroquois with whom they were negotiating. 
As Franklin said, if the Iroquois “should be capable of forming a Scheme for such an 
Union” he could not understand why “a like Union should be impracticable for ten or 
a Dozen English Colonies.” 
In fact, Franklin’s proposed plan, though supported by the commissioners who met 
in June and July of 1754, was defeated resoundingly by the colonies. Every colonial legislature 
rejected the plan, fearing it meant giving up too much control to other colonies 
and especially to the crown, who would appoint the leader. At the same time, offi cials 
in London rejected the plan because they saw it giving too much power to the colonies. 
Th ey preferred to have each colony accountable separately to London. Nevertheless, 
quite a few colonial leaders met each other for the fi rst time at the Albany gathering, 
and the possibility of union had been mentioned and considered. 
Tensions continued to grow between Britain and France and between Britain’s 
Iroquois allies and the tribes allied with the French forces. As the British colonies 
saw the world moving toward a war between Great Britain and France—a war they 
knew would be fought in large part on the border between British North America 
and New France—colonial legislatures sought to raise taxes to provide for their 
defense. Th is need was especially urgent in Pennsylvania where Indians, allied with 
France, had defeated several western settlements and were within a day’s distance of 
Philadelphia itself. 
Even in this desperate situation, however, the Penn family, which still controlled 
the colony, refused to allow their own lands to be taxed. Although William Penn had 
founded the colony as a refuge for persecuted Quakers, his son Th omas saw it mostly 
as a source of income. By 1757, the Pennsylvania legislature decided to send a delegation 
to England to negotiate directly with Th omas Penn to get him to pay his fair share 
of the funds to protect his colony or, if that failed, to request the English government to 
give them a royal governor rather than one appointed by the Penn family. Th e obvious 
representative for Pennsylvania to send was Benjamin Franklin. The 51-year-old 
Franklin sailed for England that summer and, except for brief trips home, lived there 
until 1775. He did not get the funds from Penn but enjoyed London and, for many 
years, remained a very loyal British subject, even attending the coronation of King 
George III in 1760. However, beginning in the early 1760s, the pressure of war as well 
as issues of politics, trade, and taxes began to drive Britain and the colonists apart. 
4.3 
Quick Review How did European nations and the colonies’ interaction with them affect 
life in British North America? 
CONCLUSION 
The Glorious Revolution of 1689 changed the balance of power in England’s 
government. Although kings and queens were much more than fi gureheads, Parliament 
assumed greater control over the nation and its overseas territories. In 1707 England 
united with Scotland to become Great Britain and, with its colonies in North America 
and elsewhere around the world, became a true empire. Th e wars Britain conducted 
on the European mainland over the course of the 1700s with its old enemies France 
and Spain would lead to parallel confl icts between the North American colonies of 
these empires, confl icts that also involved Native American tribes allied with each one 
of them. Great Britain also exerted its economic control over the British colonies by 
enforcing mercantilism, a closed economic system that allowed for trade only between 
the colonies and the mother country. Th is system was designed to ensure the colonies 
supplied Great Britain with raw materials; in return, the colonies did not manufacture

goods only from Great Britain. Nevertheless, Britain’s American colonies grew and 
prospered with thriving port cities and an emerging colonial elite who sometimes 
became quite good at evading the British government’s regulations. 
The social and economic life of the American colonists also changed after the 
1680s. In response to the revolt of slaves, indentured servants, and poor white farmers 
in Bacon’s Rebellion, a trend among the wealthy elite to use more slaves and fewer 
indentured servants led to deeper divisions along racial lines in Virginia. Th e southern 
colonies, where the greatest growth of the slave population was taking place, enacted 
laws that created a slave society in which African slaves could expect a lifetime of servitude. 
Th e slave trade of the notorious Middle Passage brought increased numbers of 
slaves to support a growing slave-plantation economy. 
In addition, underlying tensions connected to Indian attacks were growing. Th is 
tension, along with long-standing tensions about the role of women in society and 
beliefs across European cultures about the active role of witches in society, led to the 
Salem witch trials that involved an entire community in hysterical accusations, legal 
actions, and 20 executions. 
Women’s roles were largely relegated to the private realm—raising children and 
working in the home. Rural women oft en led lonely lives with few opportunities to 
connect with other women. Helping other women through childbirth was an important 
way rural women connected. Urban women had more options to socialize, particularly 
in the trade of household necessities such as preserved foods, soap, and candles. 
Some women joined their husbands as part of the privileged social and economic elite 
of the colonies. 
From the fi rst settlement in British North America onward, colonists maintained 
a sense that somehow their new land was a divinely planned opportunity to begin the 
world again and make it right. Cotton Mather, a well-known minister in Boston, confi 
rmed this sense in his writings. By the early 1700s, however, the sense of being on a 
divine mission had declined among many colonists, and tolerance for religious diversity 
was growing. Those in Europe and in the colonies who began to look more to 
science and human reason than to faith in trying to understand their world, called 
this time the Age of Enlightenment. Some in this period rejected all religious teachings 
while others simply emphasized reason over faith. Many ministers worried about 
a religious decline in the colonies, and some sought ways to release religious energy, 
spawning the First Great Awakening. Yet other colonists came to a growing regard 
for other forms of self-improvement and interest, like those championed by Benjamin 
Franklin in his Poor Richard’s Almanack . Increasingly, in spite of philosophical diff erences, 
colonists came to regard themselves more and more as Americans and less and 
less as simply British subjects living on a diff erent side of the Atlantic Ocean. 
How did events throughout the 1700s transition the North American colonies 
from separate entities into a colonies with more common pursuits?

ENGLAND’S GLORIOUS REVOLUTION AND “THE RIGHTS OF 
ENGLISHMEN,” 1689 
Analyze the impact of England’s Glorious Revolution on the 
thinking and political organization of British colonists in North 
America. 
Summary 
The 25 years between 1675 and 1700 were times of turmoil 
in England and its North American colonies. King James II 
expanded religious freedom for Catholics and moved to assert 
royal authority in the colonies. In 1689, Parliament forced 
James II from the throne and invited his daughter Mary and 
her husband, the Dutch prince William of Orange, to take his 
place, an event known as the Glorious Revolution. Aft er 1689, 
it was clear that Parliament was supreme in England. Th e philosopher 
John Locke justifi ed the revolution by insisting that all 
government rested on the rights of the governed. In England’s 
American colonies, news of the Glorious Revolution brought 
general rejoicing. Nonetheless, revolution in Britain produced 
winners and losers in the colonies. Independent corporations 
and colonial proprietors faced a decline in power. Catholics lost 
political rights, and all Protestants gained rights. In all colonies, 
social and economic mobility declined, and an English colonial 
elite came to dominate colonial life.

THE PLANTATION WORLD: FROM A SOCIETY WITH SLAVES 
TO A SLAVE SOCIETY 
Explain why and how slavery developed as it did in the late 
1600s and early 1700s. 
Summary 
After Bacon’s Rebellion, the planter elite began to replace 
indentured servants with slaves. At the same time, they wrote 
4.1 
4.2 
new slave codes that more clearly made slavery an inherited 
and permanent status. As the institution of slavery came to be 
more rigidly defi ned, it also came to be linked more closely to 
race. In addition, the numbers of African slaves rose dramatically 
as slavery became institutionalized. All in all, some 10 to 
15 million Africans were forced across the Atlantic between 
1500 and 1900; most were sent to island plantations and only 
a fraction came to the mainland British colonies. Th e Middle 
Passage—the transit of slaves from Africa to the Americas— 
was a horrifying experience. Slaves were treated as property, 
not as people. By the early 1700s, a small group of plantation 
owners controlled nearly all aspects of life in the southern colonies. 
It was a society in which slaves were given no respect, a 
few wealthy whites had unlimited power, and the institution of 
slavery defi ned the social order. As more white colonists came 
to depend on slave labor for their growing prosperity, they also 
lived in constant fear of slave revolts, revolts that were far from 
uncommon in all of the colonies.

Summary 
Colonial life, though far more settled in the 1700s than it had 
been in the 1600s, was still full of uncertainty and change. Th e 
hysteria that led to the Salem witch trials in the 1690s refl ected 
deep-seated fears that were just under the surface of much of 
colonial society. By the middle of the 1700s, the white culture of

British North America was generally divided between the public 
and private realms. Many white women, generally relegated to 
the private realm, lived particularly isolated lives, especially in 
rural areas. Although most Americans lived on farms, colonial 
America’s cities were quickly growing. What had largely been a 
mercantilist economy began to shift toward a capitalist economy 
during the first half of the 1700s. British economic policies 
with respect to the colonies, however, remained fi rmly rooted 
in mercantilist principles, which created tensions between 
colonists and British offi cials. Th e changing colonial economy 
gave gradual rise to a middle class. During this period, religious 
enthusiasm declined as the colonies became more religiously 
diverse. The Great Awakening, a series of religious revivals 
that swept all of the North American colonies in the late 1730s, 
refl ected the desire of many for a more direct and emotional 
Christian experience. Adding to the uncertainty of the period 
was the fact that, between 1689 and 1815, England and France 
were engaged in more or less continual series of wars with each 
other for control of global empires. For those living in North 
America, each war involved not only international struggles but 
local battles with Indian tribes that were in their own shift ing 
alliances with European powers. During the 1700s, these wars 
deepened the patriotic commitment of many English colonists 
to Britain. At the same time, those wars created circumstances 
in which colonial governments grew stronger and more 
independent.

For my part, I consider it a great advantage that we have learned 
more and more about the nature of these territories and lands, 
the character of the inhabitants, the means of helping them, to 
oppose the enemy. . . . [I]t is a great result that the French have 
won the confi dence and friendliness of the Savages, through the 
great familiarity and frequent intercourse which they have had 
with them. . . . At fi rst they fl ed from us, and feared us; now they 
wish us with them . . . for we are eyewitnesses to the fact that 
these Savages, having (as they supposed,) some advantage over 
the English, threw themselves upon them with fury, thinking, 
I believe, to get revenge for the injury that had been done us; 
but they were not successful in their attack. Likewise, towards 
the end of the year 1611, the Hollanders merely wishing to land 
at Cap de la Heve to take in some fresh water, our Savages 
assailed them fi ercely, and made away with six of them, among 
whom was the Captain of the ship. It seems to me that we will 
be unworthy of this friendliness, if we do not so act that it may 
avail them in learning to love him, from whom we receive

And my hearing him preach gave me a heart wound; by Gods 
blessing my old foundation was broken up, and I saw that my

Question 2.22 is based on the following two quotations. 
Passage 1 
Th e Plantation revolution came to the Chesapeake with the 
thunder of cannons and the rattle of sabers. Victory over the 
small holders, servants and slaves who composed Nathaniel 
Bacon’s motley army in 1676 enabled planters to consolidate their 
control over Chesapeake society. In quick order, they elaborated 
a slave code that singled out people of African descent as slaves 
and made their status hereditary. In the years that followed, as 
the number of European servants declined and white farmers 
migrated west, the great planters turned to Africa for their workforce. 
During the last decades of the seventeenth century, the new 
order began to take shape. Th e Chesapeake’s economy stumbled 
into the eighteenth century, but the grandees prospered, and the 
profi ts of slave labor fi lled their pockets. A society with slaves gave 
way to a slave society around the great estuary.

Slavery in North America, 1998 
Passage 2 
If other colonies sought to escape from English vices, Virginians 
wished to fulfi ll English virtues. Let other colonies dazzle the 
world with a City upon a hill, inspire by a commonwealth 
of brotherly love, or encourage with a vast humanitarian 
experiment. Th e model in Virginians’ heads was compounded of 
the actual features of a going community; the England, especially 
the rural England, of the 17th and 18th century. If Virginia 
was to be in any way better than England, it was not because 
Virginians pursued ideals which Englishmen did not have; rather 
that here were novel opportunities to realize the English Ideals.

5 The Making of a 
Revolution 
On May 28, 1754, George Washington, then a 22-year-old gentleman 
farmer recently promoted to lieutenant colonel in the Virginia 
militia, and Tanaghrisson, an Iroquois chief, led a force of Virginia 
militia and Indians to attack French soldiers in what is now western 
Pennsylvania. The French troops had been sent from Fort Duquesne— 
modern Pittsburgh—to look for Washington’s force. Fort Duquesne was part 
of a string of French forts built along the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers to 
maintain New France’s claims in the region. Th e French perspective was that 
the English were trespassing on their territory. Washington, however, was 
asserting the British claim to the Ohio River Valley. 
Th e English-Iroquois force surprised the French with a dawn attack. It 
had been raining and the French had failed to post sentries. Ten of the French 
were killed and 22 taken prisoner. Th e shots fi red that May morning in what 
came to be called Jumonville Glen, aft er the French commander who was 
killed there, were among the fi rst in a war that would have eff ects worldwide. 
Although Washington defeated the French in that first attack, he knew 
that a much larger French force actually controlled the Ohio River Valley. He 
retreated from Jumonville Glen and built a small armed camp that he named

Washington to surrender. Th e French allowed the English to return to Virginia 
but only aft er Washington signed a document admitting that he had attacked and 
killed—or assassinated, depending on how one translated the French—French 
troops in the May skirmish while Britain and France were offi cially at peace. 
Th at skirmish in Western Pennsylvania helped provoke a world war in the 1750s,

PRELUDES TO REVOLUTION 5.1 
Explain Britain’s victory over France in the French and Indian War and what conflicts 
followed this victory. 
In North America, the world war that started near Pittsburgh was known as the French 
and Indian War . Because of its outcome, French Canadians came to call it the War 
of Conquest. In most of Europe, it was called the Seven Years’ War. Whatever the war 
was called, it was fought over more of the planet than any previous war. Th e voyages of 
Columbus and subsequent maritime trade and migrations had created a vast interactive 
world, and in 1756, that world exploded. 
The French and Indian War, 1754–1763 
In North America, the formal declaration of war in 1756—2 years aft er Washington’s 
skirmish with the French—surprised no one. The English and their Iroquois allies 
were in constant tension with the French and their Ottawa, Delaware, and Shawnee 
allies. Both sides hated each other and were ready for war. 
During that time, Britain and France were also sliding toward war in Europe, Asia, 
Africa, and the Caribbean. In January 1756, England and the German kingdom of 
Prussia agreed to defend each other’s territory. In response, Austria signed a treaty 
with France. War among these countries was declared in May 1756, and the French 
navy defeated a British fl eet in the Mediterranean the next month. Counting on his 
English allies to provide support, King Frederick the Great of Prussia then attacked 
Austria and Russia. Sweden and Saxony joined the French alliance against Prussia. 
The war quickly spread to Asia. The British East India Company and the French 
Compagnie des Indes each controlled parts of the Indian subcontinent, either directly or 
through alliances with local rulers. Suraj ud Dowlah, the ruler of Bengal, who was allied 
with France, used the situation to attack and capture British Calcutta. A British force

French and Indian War 
Known in Europe as the Seven Years’ War and in 
French Canada as the War of Conquest, this war 
was fought in North America between 1754 and 
1763 and ended with the defeat of the French. 
Far more than anyone else, George Washington dominated the era leading up to and through the American 
Revolution. It is important to remember that for much of this time, he was—as pictured here—an offi cer in 
the British army.

under Robert Clive retook the city and the French post at Chandernagor. British control 
of Bengal, won in that war, laid the foundation for Britain’s 200-year rule in India. 
Th e British also attacked the main African slave-trading island of Goree off the coast 
of Senegal and took control of it from the French, hurting the French economy but having 
no impact on the slave trade on the island. Goree had been the port for transshipment 
of slaves since the Portuguese founded it in the 1500s and was valuable no matter which 
government controlled the island because many nations purchased slaves there. 
While battles took place in North America, Europe, India, and Africa, much of the 
Seven Years’ War was fought in the Caribbean. British warships based in Jamaica captured 
the French islands of Grenada, the Grenadines, St. Vincent, Dominica, and Tobago as well 
as Martinique and Guadeloupe with their rich sugar plantations. At the war’s end in 1763, 
Martinique and Guadeloupe were returned to France in exchange for concessions in North 
America, but the British kept the remaining islands. Aft er Spain entered the war on the 
side of France in 1761, the British captured Havana, Cuba, and Manila in the Philippines, 
all of which were returned to Spain in 1763 in exchange for Spanish Florida. 
Th e war changed the landscape of North America (see Map 5-1 and Map 5-2 ). In 
1758, aft er a French force defeated the English at Fort Ticonderoga in New York, a

MAP 5-2 North America After the French and 
Indian War, 1763. Maps 5-1 and 5-2 show the 
extraordinary changes brought about by the 
French and Indian War of 1754–1763. The fi rst 
map shows the relatively limited range of control 
exercised by both the British and the French 
colonies in North America when the war began, as 
well as signifi cant battles between the powers. The 
second map shows the huge expanse of territory 
claimed by the British at the war’s end in 1763 
including the 13 colonies along the Atlantic coast, 
the large Indian reserve of land promised to the 
tribes that had supported the British, the former 
French colonies in Canada and the former Spanish 
colonies of East and West Florida that were also in 
British hands. 
British force—with George Washington as one of its offi cers—took Fort Duquesne, 
renaming it Fort Pitt (today’s Pittsburgh) in honor of William Pitt, who had led Britain 
as prime minister during the war. Th at same year, Teedyuscung, leader of the Delaware 
tribe, decided that his French allies could not be trusted and sought an alliance with 
the English and the Iroquois. Although Teedyuscung and the Delaware did not get the 
Pennsylvania lands they sought, they and the Iroquois received a British promise that 
aft er the war there would be no white settlement west of the Alleghenies—a promise 
the British attempted to keep until the American Revolution. 
In the most signifi cant North American battle, a British army under General James 
Wolfe defeated a French army led by the Marquis de Montcalm and captured Quebec, 
the capital of French Canada, in September 1759. Th e British victory ended French 
control of all of Canada.

5.1 
By the early 1760s, both Britain and France were exhausted from the fi ghting. Although 
Britain had won major victories, its new king, George III (r. 1760–1820) wanted peace, and 
in 1763, the two countries signed the Treaty of Paris to end the war. (Both this treaty and 
the later treaty ending the American Revolution in 1783 were known as the Treaty of Paris.) 
Th e world war had many outcomes. All of the governments that fought the war 
emerged deeply in debt. In Europe, little land changed hands, but in other parts of the 
world, the changes were dramatic. Britain made concessions to bring hostilities to an 
end, but was still the biggest winner. Its dominance of India was secure, and the British 
presence on the coast of Africa and in the Caribbean was enhanced. In addition, Spain 
ceded Florida to England. Most signifi cantly, the war eliminated France as a North 
American power although France did regain its control of the rich sugar-producing 
islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique in the Caribbean. France ceded Canada and 
the land east of the Mississippi River to the British. To compensate its Spanish allies 
for their support, France also ceded its claim to the lands west of the Mississippi River, 
along with New Orleans, to Spain. Th e French threat to New England and New York 
ended. Britain now controlled most of North America east of the Mississippi River. 
Pontiac and Indian Responses 
For American Indians living between the Mississippi River and the Atlantic, the end 
of the French and Indian War was an unmitigated disaster. As a British offi cial had 
said, “to preserve the balance between us and the French is the great ruling principle 
of the modern Indian politics.” For the tribes further south—including the Cherokee 
and Creeks—the Spanish presence in Florida had allowed them to play 
a three-way balancing act between Britain, France, and Spain. But with 
the French and Spanish out of eastern North America for the time 
being, the potential for bargaining virtually disappeared. 
Even for the Iroquois, the cost was high. Although they were allied 
with the British, Iroquois power had partly come from Britain’s need 
for Iroquois allies in its competition with the French. After 1763, 
the French were gone. At the war’s beginning, the Iroquois Chief 
Hendrick, or Th eyanoguin, had told the representatives of the British 
colonies who met at Albany, New York: 
Brethren—Th e Governor of Virginia and the Governor of 
Canada, are both quarrelling.…Th e Governor of Virginia 
and Pennsylvania have made paths thro’ our Country…they 
should have fi rst asked our consent. 
Without the presence of the French in Canada, the British governors of 
Virginia and Pennsylvania had little reason to ask the Iroquois for consent 
to anything. Th e British general Lord Jeff rey Amherst, seeking to 
save money for his government and seeing no reason now to placate the 
Indians, refused to provide the gift s of ammunition and gunpowder that 
various tribes had come to see as a kind of rent for the use of their lands. 
Th e Indians considered the move to be both an insult and a fundamental 
threat since the tribes’ survival depended on the gunpowder to hunt deer. 
For the Indians who had sided with the French, the outlook was even 
worse. Neolin, a Delaware, living on the Ohio River, preached resistance 
to the “dogs clothed in red” as he called the British. His visionary message, 
calling on the Indians to return to the “ original state that they were 
in before the white people found out their country,” sparked a wideranging 
Indian movement to return to former Indian ways. 
Pontiac, an Ottawa chief, was inspired and heeded Neolin’s call, 
sparking what came to be known as Pontiac’s Rebellion . In the spring 
of 1763, only months after the Treaty of Paris was signed, Pontiac

Iroquois—was a close ally of the British until killed in battle in 1755.

convened a meeting of Ottawa, Chippewa, Pottawatomi, and Wyandot people near 
Detroit. Pontiac told his listeners of his vision in which he had been promised that, if they 
would cleanse themselves of the ways of the whites, they would see their lands and old 
powers restored. He insisted, “It is important for us, my brothers, that we exterminate 
from our lands this nation which seeks only to destroy us.” 
Pontiac and his followers attacked British forts across the region. Th e British held 
Detroit and Fort Pitt, but many other forts surrendered to the Indians: Fort Miamis, near 
Fort Wayne, Indiana; Fort Ouiatenon, near Lafayette, Indiana; Fort Michilimackinac on 
the Great Lakes; and most of the old French posts in Indiana and Ohio. Most of the Ohio 
country was again in Indian hands. Th e British were caught off guard but fought back. 
Th e English commander, Jeff rey Amherst, ordered his troops to put “every Indian 
in your Power to Death.” His troops won several battles. Amherst also encouraged 
the distribution of smallpox-infected blankets to Indians, a move that rapidly spread 
the disease. In October, Pontiac received a letter from the French telling him that the 
French were not going to come to his aid. On receiving this news, Pontiac initiated a 
peace process. He met with the British authorities in Oswego, New York, in July 1766 
and signed a treaty of peace. Th ree years later, he was murdered, probably by other 
Indians who resented both the deaths his rebellion had caused and his relatively quick 
surrender that meant the deaths were in vain. 
The Proclamation Line of 1763 
Soon aft er the long French and Indian War, the new British monarch King George III 
and his fi rst minister George Grenville tried to ensure peace in North America. Th ey 
meant to honor the commitments they had made in 1758 to the Delaware and Iroquois 
tribes and protect them from white settlement. Already embroiled in Pontiac’s confl 
ict, which largely involved formerly French territories, they did not want other rebellions, 
and they were wary that land-hungry settlers would quickly begin to expand 
into Indian-dominated areas. In October 1763, the king issued a proclamation that 
there should be no British settlement west of the crest of the Appalachian Mountains 
and that Indian rights to western lands would be protected forever. Th e proclamation 
also directed any colonists who had already settled in these lands “forthwith to 
remove themselves from such Settlements.” For many of the tribes who lived on the 
5 
Seeking support for an uprising, Pontiac described a vision 
similar to Neolin’s in which the Master of Life or the Great 
Spirit told him to return to living by “the bow and arrow” with 
no need of “gun or powder” and to cleanse his people and their 
land of the ways of the whites. Pontiac said: 
This land where ye dwell I have made for you and not for 
others. Whence comes it that ye permit the Whites upon 
your lands? Can ye not live without them? I know that 
those whom ye call the children of your Great Father supply 
your needs, but if ye were not evil, as ye are, ye could 
surely do without them. Ye could live as ye did live before 
knowing them—before those whom ye call your brothers 
had come upon your lands.

whites, the English colonists or his own people?

and spiritual reform? What connections might Pontiac have 
seen between such reforms and successful resistance to 
white encroachment?

western slopes of the mountains and beyond, the Proclamation Line fulfi lled what 
they believed they had been promised. 
Th e Grenville administration took other steps to keep peace with the Indians. Th ey 
replaced Amherst with the more conciliatory General Th omas Gage, who immediately 
resumed negotiations and gift giving with the tribes. Th e Grenville administration also 
strengthened the authority of the superintendents of Indian aff airs, who had sought 
accommodations with the tribes since the 1750s. 
Th e Proclamation Line slowed white settlement into western Pennsylvania, Ohio, 
and what would become Kentucky. But it also infuriated the British colonists—both 
land- hungry farmers and rich speculators—and did far too little to protect the Indians. 
Grenville and Parliament were too far away, and despite the British military outposts, 
their eff orts to enforce the line were ineff ectual, which had fateful consequences in the 
next decade. 
The Paxton Boys and Rural White Responses 
In the town of Paxton in Pennsylvania’s Lancaster County, a group of farmers decided 
that the way to end warfare between whites and Indians on the frontier was to get rid of 
all Indians, whether they were allied with the British or the French. Calling themselves 
the Paxton Boys or the Hickory Boys, these frontier vigilantes said: 
We have long been convinced from suffi cient evidence that the Indians that 
lived as independent commonwealths among us or near our borders were our 
most dangerous enemies. 
In December 1763, the Paxton Boys attacked a Delaware village, killed six people, and 
burned the town. Th en they killed 14 Indian survivors who were in protective custody 
in the town of Lancaster. Th ey began a march to Philadelphia to fi nd other Indians, 
especially Delawares, who had taken refuge there. Before the mob got to Philadelphia, 
Benjamin Franklin and a delegation of the colony’s leading citizens negotiated an 
end to the rebellion, but the hatred of Indians would haunt the inhabitants of North 
America for a long time to come. Aft er 1763, many white residents of British North 
America began to lump all American Indians together as an enemy race, even though 
their parents and grandparents had viewed diff erent tribes quite separately, depending 
on a tribe’s relationship to the British cause. Like many earlier wars, the fi ghting in the 
French and Indian War was between the British and the Iroquois allies on one side 
and the French and the Ojibwa, Ottawa, Shawnee, Wyandot, and other tribes allied 
with them. Soon aft er the war, the lines came to be seen as much more racial, with all 
whites allied against virtually all Indians. Th is change in attitudes had far-reaching 
consequences for the residents of North America. 
Threats of New Taxes 
Relations between the British colonists and the American Indians were not the only 
concern of British authorities aft er 1763. Victory in the war had virtually drained the 
kingdom’s treasury. Britain’s national debt was double what it had been when the war 
began. In 1764, George Grenville and the majority in Parliament asked Britain’s North 
American colonists to pay what the authorities in London thought was a fair share of 
the war’s cost. Th eir argument was that the war had protected colonists far more than 
it had anyone living in Britain. What seemed just and equitable in London, however, 
was seen quite diff erently in the colonies. Th ese diff erences on who should bear the 
cost of the war would soon have signifi cant consequences. 
Quick Review What expectations and concerns did Indians come to have regarding the 
British in the aftermath of the war of 1756–1763? What expectations and concerns were 
colonists beginning to have regarding Native Americans? Regarding the British government? 
How were the various expectations and concerns in confl ict?

Chapter 5 The Making of a Revolution 137 
5.2 
“THE REVOLUTION WAS IN THE MINDS OF THE PEOPLE” 
Explain why, in the 15 years before the Revolutionary War began, support for the patriot 
cause spread so quickly among many different groups of North Americans who opposed 
Britain for different reasons. 
Long aft er the Revolution was over, former president John Adams wrote to another 
former president, Th omas Jeff erson, describing the Revolutionary War that began in 
1775 as “only an eff ect and consequence.” According to Adams, “Th e Revolution was 
in the minds of the people, and this was eff ected from 1760 to 1775, in the course of 
fi ft een years before a drop of blood was shed at Lexington.” He was right. For many 
British North Americans, a revolutionary change did indeed take place in their minds 
between 1760 and 1775, and it took place for many diff erent reasons. 
While people like Adams and Jeff erson and many of their peers moved from being 
loyal British subjects to revolutionary advocates of independence in those years, others 
did not. People such as Thomas Hutchinson of Massachusetts, William Franklin 
(Benjamin’s son), and perhaps a fifth of the white colonists remained Loyalists — 
Americans who wanted to maintain loyal ties to Great Britain and who opposed the 
American Revolution. For reasons of their own, a majority of African slaves were 
probably also Loyalists. Th e Loyalists lived through the same momentous changes as 
those who embraced the revolutionary cause, but they came to diff erent conclusions. 
Still other colonists remained neutral throughout the struggle, focusing on personal 
matters or simply not caring who ultimately governed them. 
In addition, people in the colonies came to their own differing conclusions at 
varying times. Sailors and shop owners in Boston, New York, and Philadelphia as 
well as backwoods farmers in western Pennsylvania, Virginia, and the Carolinas 
were sometimes much more ready for revolution, much sooner, than their betterknown 
leaders. 
For African slaves, the growing spirit of revolution held both potential and danger. 
Some slaves and free blacks saw in the revolutionary rhetoric the possibility of their 
own freedom. In contrast, other African-Americans saw the British government as a 
potential protector and even liberator against slave owners who embraced the patriot 
cause. Potential for freedom was not a guarantee in any scenario, however. 
Th e Iroquois, Cherokee, and other Indian tribes knew that frontier whites had 
little use for the king’s ban on white settlement and, if freed from British authority, 
would stream west. As the possibility of expanded settlement fueled revolutionary 
fervor among frontier whites, it also fed fears among Indians, most of whom sided 
with the British aft er 1776. 
In effect, during the 15 fateful years that John Adams described above, many 
diff erent groups of people with wide-ranging hopes and fears considered the possibility 
of an American Revolution and arrived at diff erent conclusions. Each of these groups 
fought their own revolutions, sometimes in alliance with each other, sometimes acting 
at cross-purposes. Far from being clear, the goals and tactics of the revolutionaries 
were an ever-changing patchwork as diff erent groups fought for their own purposes 
and made shift ing alliances. 
Transition from the “Rights of Man” to Revolt 
Many residents of the British colonies had grown up reading John Locke’s defense 
of Britain’s Glorious Revolution of 1689. Long before tensions between the colonies 
and the government in London reached a crisis, colonists believed, as Locke said, 
that the people always retained “a supreme power to remove or alter the legislative” 
authority when they wanted to. Th roughout the 1770s, Locke’s ideas guided some of 
the Revolution’s most articulate advocates such as Th omas Jeff erson, John Adams, and 
Benjamin Franklin as well as backwoods rebels like Ethan Allen, a man of modest

education who was the leader of Vermont’s Green Mountain Boys. Using Locke’s 
arguments in their speeches and lawsuits, they taunted royal governors, and ultimately, 
they used Locke’s ideas to justify armed resistance. 
Revolutionary leaders also read and cited French philosophers—Voltaire, 
Rousseau, and Montesquieu—and authors from ancient Greece and Rome, all 
of whom advocated a commitment to liberty and the need to overthrow unjust 
authorities. Leaders of the patriot cause became convinced that England represented 
the evils of empire while the colonists represented the virtues of republicanism , which 
supported a broad distribution of power to people, enabling them to determine how 
and by whom they would be governed. 
Leaders on both sides of the Atlantic, those who argued for independence and 
those who argued to maintain the ties between Britain and the American colonies, all 
read the same literature. Nearly all of them believed that George III ruled only by the 
consent of Parliament, not from any sort of divine right. For a hundred years before 
the American Revolution, British subjects in the old and new worlds constituted a 
community of people who valued “the rights of Englishmen” and distrusted eff orts to 
undermine those rights. When in 1776 Th omas Jeff erson wrote that the colonies had 
a right to independence because it was a self-evident truth that “all men are created 
equal; that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights,” he was 
refl ecting a way of thinking that was familiar in America and Britain. 
Those who shared common ideas about rights, liberty, and freedom extended 
beyond just residents of Britain and North America. Th e world that was at war in the 
1750s and 1760s became a world involved in revolution in the 1770s and 1780s and 
beyond. Although the government of the King Louis XVI of France would play an 
essential role in the American victory, Louis XVI himself would lose his throne and 
his head to a French revolution within the next decade. Th e French and American 
Revolutions led to further revolutionary eff orts across much of Europe as people in 
Germany, Poland, Scandinavia, and Italy attempted their own revolutions. Future 
president James Madison wrote in 1792 that “America has set the example and France 
has followed it, of charters of power granted by liberty.” 
Madison did not, however, mention another revolution that was much closer to 
the United States than those in Europe. In 1791, slaves in the French colony of Saint 
Domingue (modern Haiti) rebelled. Saint Domingue was one of the richest and most 
oppressive slave systems in the world, where some 500,000 African slaves grew sugar 
and coffee that made the 40,000 French owners very rich. A free black, Toussaint 
L’Overture—who quoted the same philosophers as North American revolutionaries— 
led the rebels in Haiti to win a series of victories. L’Overture himself was captured and 
died in France, but a new free Republic of Haiti was proclaimed in 1804. Th e rebellion 
was the most successful slave revolt in history and another in a long line of revolutions 
against distant authorities. 
In addition, not long after the American Revolution, between 1810 and 1826, 
most of Latin America expelled its Spanish and Portuguese colonial masters. Simón 
Bolívar led revolutionary movements in his native Venezuela and helped establish the 
Republics of Columbia, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia. His 1812 Manifesto of Cartagena 
expressed the same philosophical ideas as those of his counterparts in North America 
and Europe. The American Revolution, then, was part of a worldwide revolution 
against distant authorities and old ideas, and it was based on a new philosophical 
understanding of “the rights of man” and the way the world should be organized. 
The Accompanying Revolution in Religion 
In 1740, a Presbyterian minister, Gilbert Tennent, one of the leaders of the Great 
Awakening (see Chapter 4 ), preached a sermon on “Th e Danger of an Unconverted 
Ministry” in churches throughout New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Tennent’s sermon, 
with its plea to test the personal faith of ministers, was a direct challenge to the leaders

A complex, changing body of ideas, values, and 
assumptions that held that self-government 
by the citizens of a country, or their representatives, 
provided a more reliable foundation for 
the good society and individual freedom than 
rule by kings or any other distant elite.

of the major Protestant denominations—Presbyterian, Congregational, and Episcopal. 
As a result of the Great Awakening, church members claimed permission—indeed, the 
responsibility—to judge their ministers. It was not a great leap for citizens to claim the 
same permission, and responsibility, for judging those in civil authority. 
One visiting revivalist asserted that Patrick Henry, rector of the Episcopal church 
in Hanover, Virginia (and uncle to the patriot leader Patrick Henry), was a “stranger 
to true religion.” Reverend Henry, in return, demanded that Virginia’s governor 
stop these “strolling preachers” who were, in his view, “a set of incendiaries, enemies 
not only to the Established Church, but also common disturbers of the peace.” In a 
way, Henry was right. Th e Great Awakening disturbed the peace, split churches, and 
undermined all authorities. 
Seaport Radicalism—From the Stamp Act to the Boston Massacre 
and Boston Tea Party 
The Boston Tea Party of 1773 was probably the most famous act of resistance in 
America before the Revolution, but it was far from the fi rst. Between 1747 and 1774, 
dockworkers, sailors, and townspeople drove the leading British offi cials—customs 
offi cials, navy offi cers, and even governors—away from the docks and out of Boston 
fi ve times. Similar acts of rebellion took place from New York to the Carolinas. 
Impressment had been British navy policy for centuries and, since the 1690s, had 
been a source of riots in colonial ports. When a warship was short of sailors, which 
happened oft en due to high rates of death and desertion, the captain had the authority 
to impress (or kidnap) likely sailors from merchant ships or ports and sign them up 
for naval service. Commercial sailors were paid higher wages than those in the navy 
and oft en had better working conditions, so impressments were, as one senior British 
naval offi cer noted, a source of “Hatred for the King’s Service . . . [and] a Spirit of 
Rebellion,” for many who lived along the waterfront. 
In November 1747, British Commodore Charles Knowles sent sailors in search of 
new recruits while his ship was in Boston Harbor. Th ey impressed 46 men into service. 
A rebellious crowd responded, taking some of Knowles’s offi cers hostage and chasing 
the royal governor out of town. A successful brewer, Samuel Adams, defended the rioters 
as an “Assembly of People drawn together upon no other Design than to defend 
themselves and repel the Assaults of a Press-Gang.” He insisted that they “had a natural 
right” to do so. Perhaps his cousin, John Adams, should have considered an earlier 
date than 1760 for the start of revolutionary thinking in the colonies. 
British actions in the 1760s and 1770s escalated tensions in North American 
cities. Th e British government desperately needed to pay off the debt from the French 
and Indian War and attempted to do so, in part, by imposing new taxes. With each 
attempt—the Sugar and Currency Acts of 1764, the Stamp Act of 1765, the Townshend 
duties of 1767, and the Tea Act of 1773—colonial resistance grew. In a spiraling series 
of encounters, Parliament sought to raise funds, backed off in the face of colonial resistance, 
and then enacted new “get tough” policies that also backfi red (see Table 5-1 ). 
Th e impact of the persistent but failed eff orts to raise taxes fueled colonial resistance 
and the sense that resistance was effective. The taxes seemed fair only to those in 
Britain who were in power. Th e colonists saw each tax as a new attack on their liberty 
and each British eff ort at compromise as a sign of weakness. 
The Sugar Act of 1764, the first tax, and the Currency Act of 1764 provoked 
limited but spirited resistance. Th e tax on sugar included rum and molasses, 
both made from sugar. The Currency Act prohibited colonies from issuing 
their own paper money as legal tender for either public debts, including paying 
taxes, or private debts, including paying merchants for goods made in Britain. In 
response, merchants and artisans in New York and Boston joined in a nonimportation 
movement in 1764 that was the beginning of a growing refusal to buy or use 
anything manufactured in Britain.

A year later, resistance to the Stamp Act of 1765 was stronger, and it united colonists 
of many social classes. Th e act required legal and commercial documents, including 
magazines, newspapers, and playing cards to be printed on special paper showing an 
offi cial stamp. Payment for the stamped paper had to be in British currency. In the 
spring of 1765, Patrick Henry asked Virginia’s legislature, the House of Burgesses, to 
pass resolutions that came to be known as the Virginia Resolves opposing the tax. 
Middling and upper-class New Yorkers—including lawyers and merchants who would 
have had to pay the highest taxes if the law was enforced—began writing articles against 
the tax in the city’s many newspapers, which circulated widely. Some also formed a 
new secret organization, the Sons of Liberty , which sent delegates to all the colonies 
to create a kind of underground resistance to the tax—a tax they described as a sign 
of British tyranny. Nine colonies sent delegates to a gathering known as the Stamp Act 
Congress in New York City in October 1765. Th ere they issued a Declaration of Rights 
and Grievances, which said that Parliament had no right to tax the colonies, and they 
petitioned for a repeal of the Stamp and Sugar Acts. 
More important than the petition was the fact that leaders of the growing resistance 
movement met together and began to sense their unity. As one of the organizers of the 
congress said, “Th ere ought to be no New England men, no New Yorker, etc. known on 
the Continent, but all of us Americans.” Th is appeal to unity was a new sentiment in 
colonies that had, up until now, jealously guarded their independence from each other. 
Britain’s parliamentary action had provoked this increasing unity. 
While colonial leaders met and wrote petitions, some of the strongest resistance 
to the stamp tax developed in the working-class taverns where laborers and sailors 
gathered. Poor people had little reason to actually pay the tax because they did not 
use many legal documents or paper products that would require the stamped paper, 
but the tax was a symbol of British arrogance and threatened to slow the colonial 
economy, which could put sailors and laboring people out of work. To the poor, the 
haughty British authorities were becoming intolerable. 
When Lieutenant Governor Cadwallader Colden placed the embossing stamps 
in Fort George—at the tip of Manhattan—until the new tax went into effect on 
November 1, 1765, public protests mounted into what came to be known as the 
New York Stamp Act Riot. New York merchants and groups like the Sons of Liberty

1770—the same day as the Boston Massacre. 
The Tea Act of 1773 Allowed the British East India Company to ship tea to the colonies without having to pay normally 
required duties, making it cheaper than most smuggled tea. The Townshend tea tax would still apply once 
it reached the colonies. The Act supported the East India Company, almost bankrupt because so many 
customers were purchasing cheaper, smuggled tea from elsewhere.

authority, shifted control of the Ohio River country to the British governor in Quebec (the Quebec Act), 
and allowed British troops to use any uninhabited building as a barracks, without the owner’s authorization 
(the Quartering Act).

agreed not to import any British goods while the Stamp Act was in force. 
In taverns across the city, angry citizens shared their discontent with the 
British. On the evening of November 1, a crowd paraded around the 
city with torches as well as effigies of the lieutenant governor and the 
devil. Th ey dared the British troops to fi re on them and burned Colden’s 
coach. Next the crowd broke into the home of Major James of the Royal 
Artillery, drank his considerable supply of liquor, and burned the house. 
Calling themselves the Sons of Neptune to distinguish themselves from 
the more middle class Sons of Liberty, the crowd resisted eff orts to end 
the violence. Months later, when news reached New York in May 1766 
that the Stamp Act had been repealed, celebrating crowds fired guns, 
broke windows, and erected a “liberty pole” to taunt British authorities. 
Similar riots by the “lower sorts” took place in other colonial cities. 
In Boston, a mob ransacked the governors home, and in Annapolis, 
Maryland, a crowd burned the stamp distributor’s warehouse and forced 
him to flee the colony. In Wilmington, North Carolina, a mocking, 
angry crowd paraded the stamp collector through the streets. And in 
Charleston, South Carolina, a crowd of workers and seamen burned effi - 
gies of the stamp distributor. 
In response to the unrest, British authorities under the new prime 
minister the Marquess of Rockingham decided to repeal the Stamp and 
Sugar taxes but also to show force. In 1766, while repealing the taxes, 
Parliament also voted the Declatory Act, which claimed its right to tax and 
regulate the colonies “in all cases Whatsoever.” In addition, Parliament 
passed the Revenue Act of 1766, restricting trade in sugar, which helped 
British and Caribbean merchants at the expense of colonial merchants. 
A year later, Charles Townshend, chancellor of the Exchequer 
( treasurer) in a new British government, imposed new taxes on lead, 
paint, paper, and tea, known as the second Revenue Act of 1767 (also 
known as the Townshend duties of 1767). Th e new British government 
was desperate to fi nd a way to pay off the war debt but also wanted to 
assert Parliament’s authority over the colonies. In particular, Parliament 
wanted to curtail smuggling by some of the most prosperous colonial 
merchants and to control the mobs that kept rioting in Boston and 
New York. In September 1768, the warships of the Royal Navy arrived in Boston, 
and British troops marched through town in a show of the government’s authority. 
According to Paul Revere, the troops “Formed and Marched with insolent Parade, 
Drums beating, Fifes playing, and Colours fl ying, up King Street.” Th e presence of so 
many troops created a sense of siege in Boston. 
A year and a half later, British soldiers were still stationed in Boston, creating 
constant tensions with residents who resented their presence. One source of the tension 
was the fact that off -duty soldiers were allowed to work on their own part-time, 
increasing competition with colonists for jobs by accepting lower wages. On the evening 
of March 5, 1770, an angry crowd began to throw snowballs at British soldiers. 
Th ey taunted the lone British sentry at the State House, Private Hugh White. As the 
crowd around White grew, more people joined in the taunting or watched from the 
sidelines. John Adams called the crowd “a motley rabble,” but they had strong support 
in a city tired of the presence of so many soldiers. 
British Captain Thomas Preston sent more soldiers to support White while the 
crowd grew to 300 or 400. Preston asked the crowd to disperse, assuring them that the 
soldiers would not fi re since he himself was standing directly in front of them. However, 
someone threw something that knocked one of the soldiers down, and some of the 
soldiers started fi ring, even though no one heard Preston give any orders. Th ree men 
were killed—including a seaman, Crispus Attucks, a former slave who was part African 
and part American Indian and who would be celebrated as the fi rst man and fi rst black

person to die in the Revolution. Two more later died of their wounds. The Boston 
Massacre , as colonists called it, fueled anger at the British authorities. To avoid further 
confrontation, the Royal Governor pulled the troops out of Boston. His action also left 
most of the town in the hands of an increasingly anti-British population. 
Some of the British troops involved were accused of murder. John Adams defended 
them in a subsequent trial (in which they were found not guilty). Later, Adams said that 
his defense of the soldiers, though highly unpopular, was, “one of the most gallant, generous, 
manly and disinterested Actions of my whole Life.” Nevertheless, Adams also said 
that there was “no Reason why the Town should not call the Action of that 
Night a Massacre.” Paul Revere described the event as a deliberate military 
attack on a peaceful crowd. Sam Adams created a “committee of correspondence” 
to encourage resistance in other colonies. With such rhetoric, 
many Bostonians would likely never again be loyal British subjects. 
In 1773, Britain decided to maintain the tax on tea, but repeal the other 
Townshend duties. The Tea Act of 1773 not only asserted Parliament’s 
authority to levy whatever taxes it wished but also attempted to protect the 
almost-bankrupt British East India Company, which was struggling because 
customers were purchasing cheaper, smuggled tea elsewhere. Under the act, 
the East India Company could ship large quantities of tea to the colonies 
without paying required duties, making the tea cheaper for the colonists, 
even with the Townshend tea tax. Th e plan was to encourage colonists to 
buy the taxed British East India Company tea instead of smuggled teas. 
Given the tension and anger in Boston, the city’s response could easily 
have been predicted. City residents had no intention of paying that tax, even 
on discounted tea. In New York, Philadelphia, and Charleston, patriotic 
groups, oft en led by the Sons of Liberty, convinced merchants not to allow 
the tea to land from the British ships. “No taxation without representation,” 
became the rallying cry from colonists who were fed up with having no say 
in matters that aff ected them. 
In November 1773, a shipment of British tea arrived in Boston on the 
ship Dartmouth . Even before it arrived, crowds had forced the tea merchants 
to barricade themselves in their warehouse. Once the Dartmouth appeared, a 
crowd forced the ship to move to Griffi n’s Wharf where dockworkers, sailors, 
and merchants, not the British authorities, controlled the dock. Th e customs 
commissioners fl ed rather than risk getting tarred and feathered, an increasingly 
popular punishment by patriotic crowds for those who supported royal authority. 
Governor Th omas Hutchinson would not let the Dartmouth sail back to England, and the 
crowd would not let the tea be unloaded. Th e stand-off lasted into December. 
On December 16, angry citizens met at the Old South Meeting House. When the 
governor would not back down, Samuel Adams said, “Th is meeting can do nothing 
more to save the country.” Th e crowd’s response—probably well rehearsed—was a series 
of faked Indian war whoops, a shout of “Boston harbor a tea-pot tonight,” and a call to 
gather at Griffi n’s Wharf. As thousands watched from the shore, men, slightly disguised 
as Mohawks, boarded the Dartmouth and dumped the tea into Boston Harbor. 
Th e Boston Tea Party galvanized anti-British sentiment in other colonies, and the 
city was seen as the incubator of revolutionary activity long before the next shots were 
fi red. In response to the incident, the British closed the port of Boston to all shipping, 
creating a fi nancial crisis that led to further anger and unrest among not only dockworkers 
but also the merchant elites who depended on the port for their wealth. 
Women, too, became increasingly involved in leading their own protests. In response 
to the Stamp Act crisis of 1765, small groups of women who were determined to boycott 
British goods in protest began calling themselves the Daughters of Liberty . New England 
women organized spinning bees to make their own cloth so they could avoid buying 
English textiles. Among the elite and working people, wearing homespun clothing

became a symbol of loyalty to the patriot cause. Th eir eff orts continued to 
strengthen and spread, especially with the strong support they got from 
newspapers. In 1774, 51 women in Edenton, North Carolina, promised not 
to consume English goods, including tea, and other women organized similar 
boycotts elsewhere. When war broke out aft er 1775 and many goods 
became scarce, women protested when colonial merchants hoarded goods 
or demanded higher prices. In 1777, women in Poughkeepsie, New York, 
broke into the house of a merchant they thought was hoarding goods. As 
the war continued, women led food riots throughout the colonies. 
Revolts in the Back Country 
Rural people on the frontier from New York to the Carolinas were also 
taking matters into their own hands, but for different reasons. Backcountry 
Virginians had rebelled in various ways against royal authority 
since Bacon’s Rebellion in 1676, and in all of the colonies, major splits 
refl ected gaps between coastal areas that had more access to, and more 
representation in, colonial governments than rural inland settlements. 
In the mid-1760s, feeling ignored and cheated by what they saw as 
distant and corrupt coastal authorities, farmers in the western regions of 
North and South Carolina created what they called the Regulator movement. 
In South Carolina, Regulators attacked when gangs of outlaws 
stole from isolated farms. Th e governor eventually agreed to create circuit 
courts in the back country, which diminished the violence. In North 
Carolina, the movement protested corrupt practices of sheriff s and court 
offi cials who forced settlers to pay illegally high taxes and legal fees. Regulators rallied 
settlers, who refused to pay the taxes, closed the courts, and attacked offi cials. Th e 
governor sent in state militia from the coastal areas, and in their largest encounter 
with the Regulators, 29 people were killed and 150 wounded. 
Throughout the colonies, however, the most contentious issue for inland 
communities was relationships with Indian tribes. Inland people complained that 
those on the coast used inland settlers as a buff er from the Indians. In Pennsylvania, 
there were also ethnic splits between the regions. Pennsylvania’s mostly English 
Quaker elite had settled around Philadelphia. As pacifists, they tried to maintain 
peaceful relations with the Indians. But between the Quakers and the Indians was 
a zone inhabited by Scots-Irish and Germans who did not share the pacifi sm of the 
Quakers and who found themselves much closer to potential Indian hostility. 
Th e rapid growth of the white population exacerbated the confl icts between frontier 
whites and Indians. Th e ever-increasing pressure for more land, a lot more land, could 
be satisfi ed only by white movement into areas that belonged to Indian tribes. As whites 
encroached, attacks by Indians increased. Settlers wanted, and expected, the British to 
protect them. But aft er 1763, King George’s Proclamation Line halted further movement 
west—at least legally. Th e British-imposed barrier caused intense anger on the frontier. 
British agents sought to not only relieve the pressure among land-hungry white 
settlers but also honor the king’s commitment to the Indians. A 1768 treaty allowed 
white settlement in present-day West Virginia and Kentucky. A similar treaty opened 
parts of western Pennsylvania and New York to white settlement. But colonists wanted 
much more land than these treaties gave them and were prepared to fi ght to get it— 
whether with Indian tribes or with the king’s representatives. 
Violence extended all along the lines of settlement. A German immigrant, 
Frederick Stump, was arrested for murdering 10 Indians in western Pennsylvania in 
1768 and then freed from jail by a white mob. In Virginia, vigilantes who called themselves 
the Augusta Boys killed Cherokees. 
General Th omas Gage, the senior British commander in North America, found the 
situation intolerable. He complained to London that, “all the people of the frontiers

from Pennsylvania to Virginia inclusive, openly avow, that they never fi nd a man guilty 
of murder, for killing an Indian.” In response to the frontier resistance, Parliament 
passed the Quebec Act of 1774, assigning all lands north and west of the Ohio River 
to the British-controlled Province of Quebec. Th at action eff ectively took Indian policy 
out of the hands of frontier agitators or royal governors along the coast. Th e Quebec 
Act also recognized the legal rights of the Catholic Church, which deeply off ended the 
overwhelmingly Protestant Americans. Colonists saw the Quebec Act as one of what 
they called the Intolerable Acts, a series of laws that included the act that closed the port 
of Boston until the price of the tea and the tax on it was paid, a revision of the colonial 
charter of Massachusetts, and a Quartering Act that allowed governors to place troops in 
any uninhabited building. Patriots insisted that because Parliament was enacting these 
laws with no representation from colonists, Britain was violating the rights of English 
subjects in North America. Parliament’s actions, including closing the port of Boston 
and challenging frontier farmers, were unintentionally provoking a common sense of 
grievance among people who had previously been quite separate in their complaints. 
Growing Unity in the Colonies—The First Continental Congress 
While people began to organize and challenge British authorities from Virginia to 
Massachusetts, leaders of the rebellion in Massachusetts asked the other colonies to join 
it in united action against what they saw as British tyranny. All of them except Georgia— 
which was fighting Creek Indians and wanted Britain’s support—sent delegates to 
Philadelphia in September 1774 to what became known as the First Continental Congress . 
Most of the delegates who came to Philadelphia agreed that Parliament had no right 
to tax the colonies without their consent. Th e delegates also sought unifi ed opposition 
to the British treatment of Boston. However, few were ready for a break with Britain. 
Th e Virginians wanted to continue to export tobacco, and South Carolina depended on 
the export of rice and indigo. Finding common ground was not easy. But the delegates 
did gain experience working together, even when they argued—which they did a lot. 
Th ere was little talk of war or independence at the 1774 gathering. But before they 
adjourned on October 26, the delegates declared that their rights were based on the 
laws of nature, the British constitution, and the colonial charters, and were not to be 
trifl ed with. Th ey also agreed to a ban on British imports to take eff ect in December 
1774, a ban on exports that would take eff ect in September 1775 (aft er the tobacco 
and rice crops were safely on their way to Britain), and—for symbolic reasons—an 
immediate ban on the consumption of tea from the East India Company. Th ey agreed 
to meet again in May 1775 if relations with Britain did not improve. 
Talk of Freedom for Slaves 
For African slaves in British North America, the most revolutionary moment of the 
1700s took place in London in July 1772. An American slave named James Somerset 
had been taken from Virginia to England as a personal servant by his master Charles 
Stewart. In London, Somerset became friends with free blacks and white abolitionists. 
In October 1771, he ran away. He was caught and put on a ship bound for Jamaica. But 
Somerset’s white friends petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus, requiring that Somerset 
be brought before a judge to determine whether he was imprisoned lawfully. Th ey insisted 
that he was held against his will—which, like all slaves, he certainly was. Eventually, the 
Lord Chief Justice ruled that since Parliament had never legalized slavery in England 
itself, as opposed to the English colonies, Somerset had to be freed because “the state of 
slavery is of such a nature, that it is incapable of being introduced on any reason, moral or 
political; but only by positive law.” Th is decision basically ended slavery in England itself. 
Th e Somerset decision caused a considerable stir in the colonies and in Britain. 
In September 1773, the Virginia Gazette noted that, as news of the decision spread, 
running away to England was “a notion now too prevalent among the Negroes, greatly

Phillis Wheatley lived an unusual life for an African 
slave. Before she was given her freedom, she was 
given considerable opportunity to learn and to 
write by the Wheatley family that claimed her. 
Her poems refl ected the yearning for freedom 
that all colonists felt, but specifi cally the hopes of 
enslaved Africans among them.

to the vexation and prejudice of their masters.” Benjamin Franklin, who was living in 
London, had once owned slaves, but now, like many others, he was turning against the 
institution, calling it “this pestilential detestable traffi c in the bodies and souls of men.” 
In Massachusetts, aft er successfully defending a slave in a trial to obtain his freedom 
in the Nantucket Court of Common Pleas, John Adams said, “I never knew a jury by a 
verdict to determine a negro to be a slave. Th ey always found him free.” 
Legal challenges were not the main ways in which slaves sought freedom before 
and during the American Revolution, however. Slaves heard about the protests of the 
Stamp Act and saw how eff ective mob action was. Some 107 slaves ran away from 
a plantation near Charleston to join other runaways who were creating their own 
communities in hard-to-penetrate swamps. 
Whites on both sides of the Atlantic noted the absurdity of colonists protesting 
their own perceived enslavement by Parliament while, as one wrote, those same 
colonists enslaved “thousands of tens of thousands of their fellow creatures!” Th e most 
consistent voice for abolition in the 1760s and 1770s came from the Quakers, who 
made it mandatory for members of their denomination to free their slaves or allow 
them to purchase their freedom. Others such as Virginia’s Arthur Lee—from a great 
slaveholding family in the colony—wrote that “freedom is unquestionably the birthright 
of all mankind, of Africans as well as Europeans.” In the 1700s, the slave trade 
was still a profi table institution. While some whites wrote anti-slavery letters and pamphlets, 
7,000 slaves were imported into Charleston in 1765. Th e debate around slavery 
was as heated as the debate around British rule, and no one living through these years 
could fail to notice the contradiction of fi ghting for liberty and enforcing slavery.

Indians and slaves? To answer this question, consider the time and context in which the 
American Revolution took place. 
masters ” Franklin Phillis Wheatley was born in West Africa in 1753. She was captured 
at age seven or eight and brought to Boston as a slave 
where she was purchased by John and Susanna Wheatley, who provided 
her with a good education. The young Phillis was moved by 
English poets, Christianity, and the talk of democracy that she heard 
in upper-class Boston in the 1760s and 1770s—which she believed 
had to be applied to slaves as well as free people. In response, she 
wrote poems about religion, slavery, and freedom, including this 
one titled, “To The Right Honorable William, Earl of Dartmouth, His 
Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for North America, &c.”. She 
was allowed to travel to London to see some of her poems published 
in 1773 and was later freed on the eve of the American Revolution. 
She died in 1784. 
No more, America, in mournful strain 
Of wrongs, and grievance unredress’d complain, 
No longer shalt thou dread the iron chain, 
Which wanton Tyranny with lawless hand 
Had made, and with it meant t’ enslave the land. 
Should you, my lord, while you peruse my song, 
Wonder from whence my love of Freedom sprung, 
Whence fl ow these wishes for the common good, 
By feeling hearts alone best understood, 
I, young in life, by seeming cruel fate 
Was snatch’d from Afric’s fancy’d happy seat: 
What pangs excruciating must molest, 
What sorrows labour in my parent’s breast? 
Steel’d was that soul and by no misery mov’d 
That from a father seiz’d his babe belov’d; 
Such, such my case. And can I then but pray 
Others may never feel tyrannic sway?

THE WAR FOR INDEPENDENCE 
Explain how political and military strategy, support for the patriot cause, and American 
alliances with France and Spain led to an American victory in the war for independence. 
As talk of rebellion spread in 1774, not long aft er the Boston Tea Party, John Adams 
overheard rural farmers discussing the events in Boston. One insisted, “If parliament 
can take away Mr. Hancock’s wharf and Mr. Rowe’s wharf, they can take away your 
barn and my house.” Adams realized that if isolated farmers were agreeing with a mob 
in Boston, revolution was possible. Indeed, battles would soon break out in Lexington 
and in Concord, starting the American Revolution. At the same time, word was quickly 
spreading among Africans regarding the disputes about slavery. Th ey were poised to 
take action to support either the colonists or the British—whichever side would benefi t 
them the most. Beginning in 1775, what had been occasional mob actions turned into 
outright warfare as increasingly well-disciplined colonial militia fought against the 
British army. While some colonial leaders met in Congress and declared independence 
in 1776, other colonists, later aided by French forces, fought a long and bitter series of 
battles that won the actual independence that had been declared. 
From Lexington and Concord to Bunker Hill—Revolt Becomes War 
General Th omas Gage also understood the growing rebellion. When Parliament passed 
the Intolerable Acts, Gage was charged with moving British troops back into Boston 
and allowing no trade until Massachusetts submitted to the crown (see Map 5-3 ). 
Gage recommended to London that eff orts be made to conciliate the colonists. But 
the leaders in Parliament were in no mood for conciliation, and Gage received orders 
to restore order at all costs. As he moved his troops, Gage kept a close eye on the 
Massachusetts rebels who kept an equally close eye on him. Paul Revere, who had 
helped lead the Boston Tea Party, now led an informal group of unemployed artisans 
who noted every troop movement in Boston. 
THE BATTLES OF LEXINGTON AND CONCORD, APRIL 1775 In the inland towns 
of Concord and Worcester, the colonial militia was collecting arms, and Gage knew 
it. Hoping for secrecy, he ordered troops to prepare to march to Concord to seize the 
arms. Th e colonists had been expecting such a move. Paul Revere was to report any 
troop movements by hanging lanterns in the steeple of the North Church—one lantern 
if the troops moved inland and “two if by sea,” meaning by boats across Back Bay. 
When the British troops started to move, Revere had two lanterns hung in the steeple 
(the British took the water route). Th en he and William Dawes began their famous 
rides through the night to alert the colonial militia. Revere himself was arrested 
by British troops, but Dawes woke Sam Adams and John Hancock, who made it to 
Concord to organize the militia. 
When the British reached Lexington Town Green at little aft er 4:30 a.m. on April 19, 
1775, they were met by colonial militia. Shots were fi red, killing eight militiamen and 
wounding 10 others. Only one British soldier was wounded in this fi rst battle of the 
Revolution. 
Th ere was no further gunfi re until the British entered the town of Concord where they 
found few arms. As they left to march the 16 miles back to Boston, militiamen hidden 
behind trees, buildings, rocks, and fences attacked their easy targets. At the end of the 
day, the British had 273 casualties, the militia 95. What had been unrest was now a war. 
Word of the battles of Lexington and Concord spread quickly. Many shared 
Th omas Jeff erson’s belief that “the last hopes of reconciliation” had now ended. People 
who were not sure about independence felt they had to make decisions. Some, perhaps 
as many as a third of all white colonists, remained loyal to the crown, though in New 
England they did so quietly. But many began to commit to what they saw as a patriotic 
cause, some even taking matters into their own hands. Ethan Allen, who since 1770

MAP 5-3 British Courts and Troops Stationed in the Colonies as the Revolution Began. As unrest grew 
in the colonies, British authorities made every eff ort to assert control. They stationed more troops in all of 
the colonies, especially in restive Boston, and established a series of courts—Vice-Admiralty Courts—in 
Charleston, Philadelphia, Boston, and Halifax, Nova Scotia. Stationing more troops and clamping down 
on smuggling did nothing to end colonial resistance and, as word spread of the battles of Lexington and 
Concord after April 19, 1775, colonial resistance only grew. 
had led his Green Mountain Boys in challenging royal authority in Vermont, and 
Benedict Arnold of Connecticut, then on the rebels’ side, organized their own militia 
and captured Fort Ticonderoga on Lake Champlain on May 10, 1775. Th e cannons 
from the fort would play a large role in the coming struggle. 
FROM THE BATTLE OF BUNKER HILL TO THE FORMATION OF THE COLONIAL 
ARMY In the weeks aft er the battles at Lexington and Concord, the Massachusetts 
militia, fortifi ed with recruits from Connecticut, began to dig in on the hills surrounding 
British-occupied Boston—Dorchester Heights to the south and Bunker Hill and 
Breed’s Hill to the north. Colonel William Prescott of the Massachusetts militia was 
put in charge of fortifying the northern hills. 

148 Part III A New Birth of Freedom—Creating the United States of America, 1754–1800 
General Gage again felt that he had to act. On June 17, Gage ordered an attack on 
Breed’s Hill. It was a British victory, but at a high cost—226 British dead and 828 wounded 
compared with 140 militia killed and 271 wounded. As one Englishman remarked, “If 
we have eight more such victories, there will be nobody left to bring the news.” 
Th e battle, which later became known as the Battle of Bunker Hill, even though 
it had taken place on Breed’s Hill, had been between ill-organized militia and regular 
units of the British army. Aft er that battle, however, the American forces became better 
organized and gained support from all 13 colonies. 
African-Americans in the Armies of Both Sides 
The outbreak of war opened a new avenue to freedom for American slaves. While 
some, like Wheatley, embraced revolution for liberty and freedom, others heeded 
diff erent words. Jeremiah, a free black in Charleston, heard the rumor that the British 
intended to “come to help the poor negroes.” He did not wait for that help but began 
to organize one of several slave uprisings in the Carolinas in 1775 and 1776. Jeremiah’s 
plans for an insurrection were discovered, and he was hanged and burned at the stake 
in August 1775 by prorevolutionary authorities in South Carolina. 
Th ere was a good reason for the rumors among the slaves. In 1775, Lord Dunmore, 
the royal governor of Virginia, under attack from the rebels, fled Williamsburg. 
In November of that year, from his refuge on a British warship, he announced: 
I do hereby further declare all indented servants, Negroes, or others…free, that are 
able and willing to bear arms, they joining His Majesty’s Troops as soon as may be. 
The proclamation terrified whites. With it, the slaves’ perspective of the revolutionary 
struggle was transformed into a struggle about who would “give them their 
liberty.” And in South Carolina where there were 80,000 slaves—60 percent of the 
population—such liberty would be a radical revolution indeed. 
Many slaves responded to the invitation. Between 800 and 1,000 slaves joined the 
British army. Dunmore organized them into what he called the Ethiopian Regiment, 
whose members wore a sash reading “Liberty to Slaves.” In one engagement, an 
American colonel, Joseph Hutchings, was captured by two of his own former slaves. 
When the British landed on Staten Island in 1776, New York and New Jersey slaves 
joined them. When they Royal Navy sailed up rivers in Pennsylvania and Maryland, 
more slaves joined them, and when the British attacked Charleston, still more joined. 
Runaway slaves built forts, tended the wounded, carried supplies, and fought 
alongside white soldiers. British generals understood that in recruiting slaves they 
were also disrupting the economies of the rebellious colonies. Although disease took a 
terrible toll among black soldiers and their families, and though many were captured 
and reenslaved, the loyalty of slaves to the British cause eventually brought freedom 
to some of them. Approximately 300 former slaves sailed with Dunmore when he left 
Virginia in 1776, and by the end of the war, British forces had relocated some 3,000 
more in Canada or in colonies in West Africa. 
Th e American army was much slower to enlist free blacks or slaves than the British. 
African-Americans, however, did serve among the colonial troops at Lexington and 
Concord in 1775, including Lemuel Haynes, who became one of the leading ministers 
in Massachusetts aft er the war. 
Washington was reluctant to arm black soldiers, fearing not only the reaction of white 
troops but also the possibility that arms given to black soldiers might eventually support 
a slave revolt. Nevertheless, by the winter of 1777–78, when things looked grim for the 
Revolution, Washington fi nally embraced black volunteers. Shortly aft er, in February 1778, 
Rhode Island off ered freedom to “every able bodied Negro, Mulatto, or Indian Man slave in 
this state…to serve during the continuance of the present war with Great Britain.” Perhaps 
one in four male slaves in the state eventually enlisted in what was known as Rhode Island’s 
Black Regiment. Th ose who survived the war were given their freedom in 1783.

Moving Toward Independence 
When the delegates to the Second Continental Congress gathered as promised in 
Philadelphia on May 10, 1775, the Battles of Lexington and Concord had changed 
everything. They knew that they had to manage a war and attempted to create the 
Continental Army. The obvious choice to command it was George Washington, a 
respected member of Congress and veteran of the French and Indian War. 
Washington took command of the colonial militia, such as it was, in Cambridge, 
Massachusetts, on July 2, 1775, shortly after the Battle of Bunker Hill. American 
resistance would be more coordinated than it had been during the early skirmishes. 
Washington commanded between 9,000 and 14,000 troops—he was never sure—while 
Gage led about 5,000 in Boston. Despite the difference in numbers, the Royal Navy 
controlled the water, and Gage’s troops were highly disciplined soldiers. Washington’s 
troops were a ragtag army, capable of eff ective guerrilla fi ghting and great courage, but 
hard to discipline, easily bored, and ready to return to their homes if fi ghting dragged on. 
Aft er selecting Washington and beginning to fi nd the money—mostly in foreign 
loans—to support an army, the Second Continental Congress turned to another pressing 
question: What did they want from the war? John Dickinson of Pennsylvania wanted 
reconciliation with Britain if Parliament would respect the rights of the colonists. John 
Adams and most of the Virginia delegates wanted independence. Others were not sure. 
It took a year for the debate to be resolved, and before then, other matters intervened. 
THOMAS PAINE’S COMMON SENSE While the Congress debated independence, a 
new arrival from England, Th omas Paine, published a pamphlet, Common Sense , in 
January 1776. Soon, over 100,000 copies were in circulation. Paine asked, “Why is it 
that we hesitate?…For God’s sake, let us come to a fi nal separation.…Th e birthday of 
a new world is at hand.” Paine made two basic points: that monarchy was always a bad 
way for people to be governed and that the time was right to declare independence. 
With his passionate words and exquisite timing, Paine shaped public opinion. Common 
Sense appeared on the same day George III declared the North American colonies to 
be in a state of rebellion. Th e two events could not have contrasted more clearly. John 
Adams was no admirer of Paine or his pamphlet, which he saw as simple minded and 
needlessly antagonistic, though he agreed with its conclusion. Nevertheless, Adams 
said that he expected Common Sense to become the “common faith” of the new nation. 
Declaring Independence, 1776 
On June 7, 1776, aft er months of debate in the Congress, Richard Henry Lee, a delegate 
from Virginia, off ered a motion: 
Resolved…that these United Colonies are, and of a right ought to be, free and 
independent states, that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British 
Crown, and that all political connection between them and the state of Great 
Britain is, and ought to be, totally dissolved. 
John Adams immediately seconded the motion. 
In the debate that followed, delegates led by John Dickinson opposed the 
resolution. Most of the delegates had likely come to this Congress with the hope of 
reconciliation, not with any plan for permanent separation. But the fighting with 
British troops and the influence of publications like Common Sense had changed 
many minds. Congress eventually agreed to delay a vote on independence until July 1 
but to also appoint what became known as the Committee of Five—Th omas Jeff erson, 
Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, Roger Sherman, and Robert Livingston—to draft a 
declaration in case Congress did vote for independence. 
Jeff erson, known for his skill with words, was chosen to write the fi rst draft . Adams 
and Franklin, and ultimately the full Congress, made adjustments, which frustrated 
and hurt the sensitive Jefferson. The most important changes included removing

Recently arrived from England, Thomas Paine took 
up the patriot cause with a fervor that many more 
established colonists lacked. In his easy-to-read 
pamphlet, Common Sense, he attacked not only 
the British treatment of the colonies but also the 
very idea of monarchy. His words were signifi cant 
in fanning the fl ames of the independence 
movement.

Jeff erson’s passionate attack on the slave trade, which was hypocritical in light of the 
fact that Jeff erson owned many slaves and made no move to free them. In addition, 
far too many of the others in the Congress had investments in the trade to accept 
Jeff erson’s language anywhere in the document. However, no one suggested removing 
Jeff erson’s assertion that the king “has endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our 
frontiers, the merciless Indian savages,” even when they all knew that it was whites 
on the frontiers who were invading Indian territory, and the king’s government was 
trying to keep the two apart. Th ose in Congress saw the frontier whites as essential 
supporters of the patriot cause and were in no mood to antagonize them. 
Th e waiting period before the vote paid off . By July 1776, no one was willing to 
go on record as being opposed to independence. On July 2, a unanimous Congress 
voted for independence, and on July 4, they adopted a declaration of independence 
that began with these powerful words: 
When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to 
dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to 
assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which 
the laws of nature and of nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the 
opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel 
them to the separation. 
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal; that 
they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among 
these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. 
The philosophical ideas that John Locke had used to defend England’s change in 
monarchs were now, a hundred years later, used to announce to the world that monarchy 
itself was being abolished in England’s former colonies. In Philadelphia, people 
celebrated with “bonfi res and ringing bells, with other great demonstrations of joy.” 

Chapter 5 The Making of a Revolution 151 
A crowd in New York tore down the statue of George III, Washington built up morale 
in the army by reading the Declaration to his troops, and the celebrations continued up 
and down the coast. 
THE ARTICLES OF CONFEDERATION A year later, the Congress adopted a governing 
document for the new and fragile country they had created. In 1777, the Articles of 
Confederation created a national, though weak, government for what was now called 
the United States of America. Although 11 of the colonies ratifi ed the Articles within 
a year, the last, Maryland, did not do so until 1781. Nevertheless, with the Articles of 
Confederation, states banded together in a formal—and ultimately successful—alliance 
to prosecute the war and govern the nation in the peace they hoped would follow. 
With the Declaration of Independence, the 13 diff erent colonies declared themselves 
to be 13 independent states that agreed to work together for certain limited common 
purposes. Although they were committed to cooperate, especially in fi ghting for independence, 
the representatives were distrustful of centralized government. Under the 
Articles of Confederation, there would be no national executive or court system in 
the new nation. In addition, Congress could raise money through taxes only if every 
state agreed. Nevertheless, this government—really, an alliance of independent states 
more than anything that looked like a modern nation—was able to coordinate its fi ght 
and win the Revolution. Whether such a government could build a nation, however, 
remained to be seen. 
George Washington and His Victorious Patchwork Army 
Th e American Revolution was a long and bloody war between two strikingly diff erent 
armies. On one side were Washington’s patchwork Continental Army and various 
rebel militias—later supported by troops from France and Spain. In the course of the 
long war, some 200,000 of the 350,000 men who could have served participated in 
some military activity, but the turnover was such that no more than 25,000 served 
at any one time. Fighting against them was a corps of extremely well-trained British 
troops, supported by organized units of Loyalist colonists (as many as 8,000 at the start 
of the war and increasing as the war continued) and hired soldiers from Germany. 
Ultimately, many factors led to the success of the ragtag rebels and their allies in their 
battles with the British troops (see Map 5-4 ) and perhaps more important their ability 
to survive in spite of the British eff ort to eliminate them as a fi ghting force. 
Most of the revolutionary Minute Men who fought at Lexington and Concord 
(called Minute Men because they had pledged to be ready to fight on a minute’s 
notice) were farmers who owned their own weapons and knew how to shoot. In some 
of the early battles, the popular image of the “citizen soldier” may have been true as 
farmers and townspeople took up arms to defend their communities. But as the war 
continued, and as Washington and his offi cers created the kind of discipline necessary 
for an eff ective army, more and more of the early volunteers faded away, replaced 
by recently indentured servants, impoverished transients, or those who traded a jail 
cell for a uniform. A colonial offi cer called the troops, “a wretched motley Crew,” but 
Washington was an eff ective leader who never seemed to lose control when others 
started to panic, and he was deeply committed to the cause. 
Despite being ill-trained, ill-fed, ill-clothed, and restless, these troops continued to 
fi ght, even aft er seeing the “horrors of battle…in all their hideousness,” as one soldier 
remembered. Surprisingly, these oft en forgotten men are who won the independence 
that others celebrated. 
A few women also took a direct role in the war. Armies in the 1700s usually 
included women known as camp followers. Some were the wives of soldiers, who could 
not or would not leave their husbands. Others were single women seeking adventure 
or simply survival in army life and army rations. Camp followers carried water to the 
battlefi eld, fed and supported the troops, nursed the wounded, and occasionally fought 
in battles. Mary Ludwig Hays, known as Molly Pitcher (for the water she carried),

Washington understood that though his army could fi ght, they could not withstand 
a direct battle with British regulars. He told Congress that he needed to fi ght a 
defensive war and avoid any general action. For much of the war, his goal was not a 
decisive victory, but avoiding a decisive loss. Th e longer Washington was able to keep 
his army together and out of too many battles, the better the chance that the British 
would tire of the war. He knew how well-trained the British army was—having served 
in it—but he also expected that training and discipline had narrowed their conception 
of war and would give him the edge as long as his troops could use nontraditional 
tactics and avoid capture or defeat.

J oseph Plumb Marin was a private in the American army through 
eight years of war. He saw few direct battles but many small skirmishes. 
Martin knew that his primary task was to survive and avoid 
capture. His humorous journal, written when he was 70 years old, 
makes clear that his greatest enemies were neglect and hunger. 
I, the redoubtable hero of this Narrative, first made my 
appearance in this crooked, fretful world, upon the twenty-first 
day of November, in the year 1760.…I remember the stir in the 
country occasioned by the stamp act, but I was so young that I 
did not understand the meaning of it; I likewise remember the 
disturbances that followed the repeal of the stamp act, until the 
destruction of the tea at Boston and elsewhere; I was then thirteen 
or fourteen years old, and began to understand something 
of the works going on. . . . Time passed smoothly on with me till 
the year 1774 arrived, the smell of war began to be pretty strong, 
but I was determined to have no hand in it, happen when it 
might; I felt myself to be a real coward. What—venture my carcass 
where bullets fly! That will never do for me.…I was ploughing in 
the field about half a mile from home, about the twenty-first day 
of April [1775], when all of a sudden the bells fell to ringing, what 
the cause was we could not conjecture.…During the winter of 
1775–6, by hearing the conversation and disputes of the good 
old farmer politicians of the times, I collected pretty correct ideas 
of the contest between this country and the mother country, (as 
it was then called).…I felt more anxious than ever, if possible, to 
be called a defender of my country. 
1777—Next morning, we joined the grand army near 
Philadelphia, and the heavy baggage being sent back to the 
rear of the army, we were obliged to put us up huts by laying up 
poles and covering them with leaves; a capital shelter from winter 
storms.…About this time the whole British army left the city, 
came out and encamped, or rather lay, on Chestnut-hill in our 
immediate neighborhood; we hourly expected an attack from 
them; we had a commanding position and were very sensible 
of it. We were kept constantly on the alert, and wished nothing 
more than to have them engage us, for we were sure of giving 
them a drubbing, being in excellent fighting trim, as we were 
starved and as cross and ill-natured as curs. The British, however, 
thought better of the matter, and after several days maneuvering 
on the hill, very civilly walked off into Philadelphia again. 
Starvation seemed to be entailed upon the army and every animal 
connected with it.… 
1780—Here was the army starved and naked, and there their 
country sitting still and expecting the army to do notable things 
while fainting from sheer starvation.

THE BRITISH EVACUATE BOSTON After the Battle of Bunker Hill, the British 
controlled Boston but were hemmed in there. Through the winter of 1775–76, 
Washington commissioned a promising soldier, Henry Knox, a young Boston 
bookseller, as a colonel in the Continental Army and sent him and his men to move 
the guns captured at Fort Ticonderoga on sleds over snow-covered mountains to 
Boston. On the night of March 1, 1776, Washington’s troops assembled the guns on 
Dorchester Heights and then bombarded the city until March 17 when the British 
fi nally evacuated Boston. 
THE WAR IN THE NORTH—MANHATTAN, TRENTON, AND VALLEY FORGE The 
victory in Boston was one of the few outright victories Washington would achieve. 
Washington’s goal, however, was to engage in more indirect strategies that would wear 
down the British while preserving his own limited troops. 
Just as the American Congress was declaring independence in Philadelphia in 1776, 
Sir William Howe, who had replaced Gage as the British commander, landed his army 
on Staten Island, across from Manhattan. Howe had some 32,000 troops, including 8,000 
German mercenaries—essentially soldiers for hire—known as Hessians (since many 
were from the German province of Hesse). During the war, some 30,000 Hessians fought 
for the British, approximately a quarter of all of their soldiers. Hessian troops were 
5.2

5.3 

154 Part III A New Birth of Freedom—Creating the United States of America, 1754–1800 
recruited, oft en by force, from among the poorest Germans, and German princes would 
rent them out as units, especially to the British. Many Hessians soldiers had little interest 
in the British cause, but had little choice except to fi ght for it. Washington had his own 
morale problems, but his soldiers were somewhat more willing to fi ght. 
As the two sides watched each other, Washington’s troops dug fortifications to 
defend Brooklyn and Manhattan. In late August, Howe’s larger and better-trained 
force attacked Brooklyn. Rather than risk battle and capture at this point, Washington 
abandoned Brooklyn and brought all 9,500 of his troops across the East River to Manhattan 
on the night of August 30. When Howe attacked Manhattan in September, Washington 
again retreated. Th roughout the early fall, Washington continued a retreat, and the British 
advanced through New Jersey. As they settled down for the winter, the British held most 
of New Jersey, while Washington’s army was across the Delaware River in Pennsylvania. 
Th en, on Christmas night of 1776, Washington and 2,400 troops made a daring 
raid across the Delaware River and captured Trenton, New Jersey. They also captured 
many Hessian soldiers, some of whom quickly joined the rebel side. In January, 
they would go on to successfully attack a British force in Princeton. By the winter of 
1776–77, Washington controlled southern New Jersey while the British held northern 
New Jersey and New York City, which they would control throughout the war. 
In May 1777, British General John Burgoyne assembled a large army in Canada. 
His plan was to proceed down the Hudson River and smash the “unnatural Rebellion” 
in New York and New England. Initially, the plan went well. Burgoyne had some 8,300 
men, including 3,000 German troops. He led his army across Lake Champlain, overran 
the Americans at Fort Ticonderoga, and continued south into New York’s Hudson 
River Valley, an exhausting eff ort that involved moving a large army with heavy supplies 
through dense forests. As he moved through the area, Burgoyne’s sometime 
pompous pronouncements to colonists and the German troops’ inability to communicate 
with them bred additional colonial resentment and motivated fresh volunteers for 
the American cause. 
In September 1777, near Saratoga, New York, Burgoyne’s army encountered 
American troops under the command of an experienced general, Horatio Gates, and 
Benedict Arnold (still on the American side, but soon to be caught negotiating a plan 
with the British to defect). Th e British were surprised that their bayonet charge could 
not break the American lines. Both armies suff ered heavy losses, but neither won a 
decisive victory. Burgoyne’s army was now cut off from its winter quarters and, shortly 
aft er, was forced to negotiate. Some 5,800 British troops were captured and held as 
prisoners until the end of the war. Th e Battle of Saratoga, was a turning point for the 
colonial cause. It eliminated a signifi cant British force, and it proved to the world— 
especially those in France and Spain who were watching the war closely—that the 
Americans could stand up to Britain’s toughest troops. As a result, American diplomats 
including Benjamin Franklin were able to negotiate an agreement with the French and 
later the Spanish to recognize the united colonies and provide military assistance. 
The British wanted not only to split the colonies and, especially, to capture 
Washington and his army, but also to catch the members of the Continental Congress 
by overtaking Philadelphia where the Congress met. In September 1777, British troops 
captured Philadelphia, but the members of Congress escaped before the British arrived. 
Washington was able to block supplies into the city, and the following spring, the 
British abandoned Philadelphia, which remained in colonial hands for the rest of the 
war, though there were continued riots between patriots and Loyalists in the city. 
Before the British left Philadelphia, however, the American forces had to survive 
perhaps their most diffi cult winter. Washington selected Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, 
18 miles northwest from Philadelphia as a place to keep an eye on the British in the city. 
His army was exhausted, cold, and hungry, and they got colder and hungrier as the winter 
continued. For weeks, there was little to eat. In time, however, Washington was able 
to appoint commissary offi cers who found food and clothing for the soldiers. A Prussian

offi cer volunteering in the American cause, Baron von Steuben, began training the troops 
in close order drills. Von Steuben possessed expertise in military training and hoped to 
make a name, and a home, for himself in a free America. In addition, a French offi cer, the 
Marquis de Lafayette, was recruited to lead forces that harassed the British. By the time 
the British sailed out of Philadelphia, the American troops were better fed and clothed, 
better trained, and ready for new battles— preparation they would need in the next years. 
In 1778, General Sir Henry Clinton replaced Howe, and a new British strategy 
took shape. Clinton ordered the Royal Navy to harass the colonists up and down the 
Atlantic coast and encouraged Britain’s Indian allies to attack frontier settlements. 
In addition, he sent the main British land force south to overrun the Carolinas and 
Georgia. If he could detach those three colonies, Clinton thought, the Revolution 
might crumble. After 1778, the major battles of the war would be in the colonies’ 
western and southern regions. 
THE IMPORTANCE OF FRANCE AND SPAIN Th e Revolution was won by the rebels 
for many reasons, including the key fact that France and Spain were willing to help. 
Th e two countries had their own reasons for wanting to embarrass the British and 
reduce Britain’s power on the world stage. In particular, both France and Spain wanted 
greater access to trade with North America, which was highly restricted as long as 
the British controlled the colonies. By the 1770s, the French still resented the British 
victory in the Seven Years’ War and wanted to ensure that France, not Britain, was the 
dominant power in Europe. As early as 1775, France sent agents to America to see 
what might be gained from assisting in the rebellion. Similarly, Spain started to supply 
the colonists with food and gunpowder from Spanish-held New Orleans and Cuba. 
While they were willing to support the rebellion, neither France nor Spain wanted 
to engage in war with Britain unless the colonists were serious. In arguing for a declaration 
of independence in 1776, Adams told the Congress: “Foreign powers cannot 
be expected to acknowledge us, till we have acknowledged ourselves and taken our 
station among them as a sovereign power, an independent nation.” He had two specifi c 
foreign powers in mind. 
In 1776, Benjamin Franklin led an American delegation in Paris to seek further 
help. Franklin with his simple fur cap and plain spectacles, yet sophisticated manner, 
charmed the French. However, Franklin needed more than charm to win real 
help. With the Americans’ declared independence and victory over Britain’s troops 
at Saratoga, French leaders started to take him more seriously. His diplomatic eff orts 
secured important supplies and, in February 1778, a full French alliance with the 
United States of America, the fi rst diplomatic recognition of the new nation. A few 
months later, France formally declared war on Great Britain. For the rest of the war, 
Washington could count on the French army and navy to fi ght the British. 
In 1779, Spain also declared war on Britain. Spanish forces moved up the Mississippi 
River from New Orleans and along the Gulf Coast and took the British forts at Baton 
Rouge, Natchez, Mobile, and Pensacola. Spanish attacks in the Mississippi River Valley 
diverted British troops from the Atlantic coast, helping the American eff ort. 
Once France and Spain went to war with Britain, the American Revolution became 
a world war. The French and British navies fought in the English Channel, Spain 
attacked British-held Gibraltar in the Mediterranean, and all of them fought battles 
in the Caribbean. Most important for the American cause, the French fl eet supported 
Washington’s troops throughout the latter part of the war while Spanish funds and 
smuggling eff orts provided badly needed supplies. 
THE IROQUOIS AND THE BRITISH Th e Iroquois were divided about how to respond 
to the rebellion, and at the beginning of the war most sought to remain neutral. 
However, many saw Britain as the key to their independence, and as the war continued, 
neutrality faded. Beginning in the summer of 1777, Mohawks under the leadership 
of Th ayendanegea, also known as Joseph Brant, attacked white communities 
5.2 
5.1 
5.3 

156 Part III A New Birth of Freedom—Creating the United States of America, 1754–1800 
across New York and Pennsylvania. Th e attacks on farms threatened a crucial colonial 
food supply. In response, in the summer of 1779 Washington sent perhaps a third of 
his army to attack the Iroquois and “lay waste all the settlements around…that the 
country may not be merely overrun but destroyed.” From Washington’s perspective, 
the Iroquois had to be stopped. For the Iroquois, Washington’s fi erce response was 
proof that the American leadership would always be an implacable enemy. Both sides 
adopted brutal scorched-earth tactics that left long-lasting hatreds. 
BRITISH LOYALISTS Colonists who remained loyal to Britain formed their own 
militia, and in the Carolinas, an army of over a thousand Loyalists challenged rebel 
forces. Other Loyalists joined British regiments. American rebels had nothing but contempt 
for them. In the New York-New Jersey area, Catherine and Phillip Van Cortland, 
one of the area’s leading families, remained loyal to Britain. When Washington gained 
control of their part of New Jersey, he ordered that the Van Cortland house be used 
as an army hospital. With her husband away, Catherine and her children were told to 
leave. She described their February 1777 departure: 
Our youngest children could not pass a far yard where they were milking cows 
without wishing for some. My little Willing was almost in agonies, springing in 
my Arms and calling for milk. I therefore rode up and requested the good man 
to let me have some from one of his pails.…the man stopped, asked who we 
were, and…swore bitterly he would not give a drop to any Tory Bitch. I off ered 
him money, my children screamed; and, as I could not prevail, I drove on. 
In some cities including Newark, New Jersey, in 1777 and Philadelphia in 1780, the 
wives of missing Loyalists were exiled by the American forces. Some Loyalist families 
were able to blend back into their old homes aft er the war, but many left for Canada or 
England and never returned. 
WOMEN’S SUPPORT FOR WASHINGTON’S ARMY In 1780, at a particularly 
bad time for the Continental troops, Esther De Berdt Reed 
(wife of the governor of Pennsylvania) and Sarah Franklin Bache 
(Benjamin Franklin’s daughter) asked patriot women to give up all luxuries 
and contribute to a fund for the Continental Army. Eventually, 
the women raised $300,000, a huge sum at the time. 
Th e women’s goal was to give $2 in hard currency to every soldier. 
Washington refused the offer and asked the women instead to buy 
cloth and sew shirts for the soldiers. Th e women agreed and produced 
thousands of shirts for the ill-clad troops. Th e experience also led to 
the creation of the Ladies Association, the fi rst intercolonial organization 
of women in America and a model for future national organizations 
of women. 
Women throughout the colonies found additional ways to support 
the cause. In Fishing Creek, South Carolina, young girls went from 
farm to farm, asking, “Is the owner out with the fi ghting men?” If the 
answer was yes, then they harvested the land. In fi ve or six weeks, they 
had completed the harvest for the whole county, saving patriot farmers 
from economic ruin and providing food stores for the revolutionary 
cause. Stories of similar eff orts abounded. 
THE WAR IN THE SOUTH—FROM CHARLESTON TO 
YORKTOWN After capturing Savannah, Georgia, in December 
1778, the British attacked Charleston, South Carolina, in 1780, and on 
May 12, 1780, that city surrendered. Th e loss was signifi cant. If the 
British took control of Georgia and the Carolinas, it would be hard 
to continue the resistance in the name of the united colonies and the 
strategy seemed to be working. 
Sarah Franklin Bache, unlike her half-brother William, was a staunch 
defender of the patriot cause. She led an eff ort to raise funds for 
the troops in the Continental Army and later led an eff ort in which 
Philadelphia women made 2,200 shirts for the soldiers.

Chapter 5 The Making of a Revolution 157 
As the battle for control of the south continued, Washington named one of his generals, 
Nathaniel Greene, to lead a southern campaign. Greene divided the American 
forces, taking command of half and assigning others—a contingent of Maryland and 
Virginia militias—to Daniel Morgan, an experienced offi cer from Virginia. Th e British 
commander, Lord Cornwallis also divided his army between himself and Lieutenant 
Colonel Banastre Tarleton, who had a reputation for exceptional cruelty. 
While the two armies maneuvered, smaller independent units fought their own 
battles. Not every resident of South Carolina supported independence, and local 
Loyalists fought against colonial units. Th roughout 1780 and 1781, the South Carolina 
backcountry was fi lled with ugly and oft en personal confl icts. Unlike other colonies, 
the civilian death toll was high in South Carolina as a result. 
Morgan made a stand against the British forces in a South Carolina pasture 
known as Cowpens in January 1781. In one of the last full-scale battles of the war, the 
American troops defeated Tarleton’s army and captured some 800 British soldiers—a 
crucial American victory. Although the British still held Charleston and small units 
loyal to the British harassed the revolutionaries, aft er Cowpens, the Americans were in 
control of the South Carolina countryside. 
Cornwallis saw little chance of further success in the Carolinas and marched into 
Virginia in May 1781. He decided to fortify Yorktown on the York River where he 
thought he could count on being resupplied by water. As Cornwallis’s troops dug in at 
Yorktown, Washington was in the north planning another attack on New York City. 
Greene’s army was far to the south. At the prodding of the French, Washington moved 
quickly to take advantage of the situation. In September, the French navy blockaded 
the York River and cut Cornwallis off from resupply. Then, supported by French 
troops under the Count de Rochambeau, Washington marched his own army from 
New York 450 miles south at surprising speed. On September 28, Washington’s 16,000 
troops attacked Yorktown. Th e siege continued for the next 2 weeks, but aft er failing at 
an attempted escape, Cornwallis surrendered on October 17, 1781.

led, British eff orts to defeat the Continental Army were at a standstill.

T HE TREATY OF PARIS T he surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown did not end 
the war, but it virtually guaranteed that it would eventually end favorably for the 
Americans. British troops still controlled New York City, Charleston, Savannah, and 
parts of the countryside, but many in Parliament were tired of the war, and public 
opinion in Britain had turned against continued hostilities. In June, 1780, Congress 
had sent John Jay to join Benjamin Franklin and John Adams in Paris to negotiate 
peace. Aft er news of the Yorktown surrender arrived, the British delegates agreed to a 
draft treaty that began, “His Britannic Majesty acknowledges the said United States . . . 
to be free Sovereign and independent States.” Th e two sides continued to negotiate 
boundaries, fi shing rights, and legal claims, and Britain concluded separate treaties 
with France and Spain. Th e fi nal treaty was signed in Paris on September 3, 1783. Th e 
Revolutionary War was over, and a new nation had been born.

Quick Review Did the French and Indian War lead directly to the coming of the American 
Revolution? What other factors might have prevented or caused the outbreak of war in 
1775? Make a list of some of the different groups that came to the conclusion that life 
would be better for them if the colonies were independent from Great Britain. Why did 
they want independence? Could any independent nation satisfy such diverse goals? 
CONCLUSION 
Many factors led to the beginning of the American Revolution. As American colonists 
sought to evade British taxes, John Locke’s ideas about the “Rights of Man” infl uenced 
some men—and women—and provided a moral justifi cation for disobeying the crown. 
Th e First Great Awakening led many to challenge religious and civil authority. 
While ideas fueled the confl icts, the aft ermath of the French and Indian War led 
to some of the most decisive event leading up to the colonies’ break with Britain. 
While the colonists benefi tted from the British takeover of New France, many rebelled 
against Parliament’s eff orts to get colonists to help pay the cost of this war through 
increased taxation without representation in Britain’s Parliament. Many colonists, 
too, would not honor George III’s Proclamation Line of 1763, which prevented them 
from appropriating Indian land. Slaves in the American colonies welcomed news that 
courts in England were moving toward outlawing slavery there; however, plantation 
owners, who depended on slavery and the slave trade, now had another reason for 
supporting an open break with the mother country. As resistances to British policies 
and taxes grew, Parliament responded with new taxes and sent more troops, which 
only infl amed colonists’ passions and further united them against British rule. 
At the first and second Continental Congresses, representatives of the colonies 
debated the best course of action. In 1775, violence escalated. The combination of 
unwanted British armed forces in North America as well as unwanted taxes and oppressive 
laws culminated in armed resistance by the colonists. By mid-1775, Americans had 
formed their own army under George Washington. Th e protracted war that followed 
engulfed the colonies, involving not only white men but also white women, slaves, 
and the Indians, along with armies and aid from France and Spain. Finally, aft er years 
of avoiding capture by the British army and some successful victories by the patriot 
forces, new alliances with France and Spain helped the colonists army commanded by 
George Washington win the surrender of the largest British army in North America. 
With the surrender of the British forces at Yorktown in 1781, and the Treaty of Paris 
in 1783, the independence of the United States became a reality. 
Which factors do you think were most important in leading to the colonists 
victory against the British Empire?

PRELUDES TO REVOLUTION 
5.1 
Explain Britain’s victory over France in the French and Indian 
War and what confl icts followed this victory. 
Summary 
Th e Seven Years’ War, known in the colonies as the French and 
Indian War, was fought in North America, Europe, Asia, Africa, 
and the Caribbean. There were many outcomes of the world 
war of 1754–1763. Britain victory secured its dominance of 
India and enhanced the British presence on the coast of Africa 
and in the Caribbean. Most significantly, the 1763 Treaty of 
Paris that offi cially ended the hostilities eliminated France as a 
North American power. For American Indians living between 
the Mississippi River and the Atlantic coast, the end of the war 
was an unmitigated disaster, particularly because they could no 
longer play one country against the other to gain bargaining 
power. Britain’s victory came at a high fi nancial cost—soaring 
debt from the war itself as well as new and expensive military 
obligations in North America. The British government was 
determined that colonists should shoulder some of the burden 
of these costs.

Preparing to Write: Write a Thesis 
A strong thesis statement that clearly articulates a central argument 
is the foundation of any essay. With this in mind, review 
the discussions of Pontiac’s Rebellion, the Paxton Boys, and the 
Proclamation Line of 1763 included in this chapter. When you 
are fi nished, write a thesis statement for an essay on the role of 
anti-Indian sentiment in the growing tensions between British 
colonists and the British government in the decade following 
the Seven Years’ War. 
“THE REVOLUTION WAS IN THE MINDS OF THE PEOPLE” 
5.2 
Explain why, in the 15 years before the Revolutionary War 
began, support for the patriot cause spread so quickly among 
many different groups of North Americans who opposed 
Britain for different reasons. 
Summary 
For many British North Americans, a revolutionary change in 
outlook occurred between 1760 and 1775, and it took place for 
many diff erent reasons. Some colonists were inspired by the ideas 
of the Enlightenment. Others were moved by religion to take a 
more skeptical view of authority. Sailors and shop owners in 
Boston, New York, and Philadelphia as well as backwoods farmers 
in western Pennsylvania, Virginia, and the Carolinas were oft en 
much more ready for revolution, much sooner, than their betterknown 
leaders because British actions were seriously affecting 
their lives. For African slaves the growing spirit of revolution had 
both potential and danger. Some slaves and free blacks saw in the 
revolutionary rhetoric the possibility of their own freedom. Other 
African-Americans saw the British government as a protector and 
even liberator. Most Indians, fearing the colonists would expand 
their settlements, sided with the British government.

THE WAR FOR INDEPENDENCE 
5.3 
Explain how political and military strategy, support for the 
patriot cause, and American alliances with France and Spain 
led to an American victory in the war for independence. 
Summary 
British efforts to ensure the enforcement of the Intolerable 
Acts led to the first battles of the Revolutionary War at 
Lexington and Concord in April 1775. Aft er these battles, the 
Continental Congress began to prepare for war. By the summer 
of 1776, Congress was ready to declare independence. Th e 
Articles of Confederation that Congress agreed on created a 
clear, though weak, national government. George Washington’s 
first task was to transform his forces into a real army. The 
American victory at Saratoga in 1777 brought the French in on 
the American side. Aft er 1778, the British strategy shift ed, and 
most of the fi ghting took place in the West and South. French 
and Spanish support proved crucial to the winning of the 
Revolutionary War. Th e decisive battle of the war was fought at 
Yorktown, Virginia, in the fall of 1781. Th e fi nal treaty ending 
the war was signed in Paris on September 3, 1783.

6 Creating a Nation 
In 1787, a Philadelphia physician, Benjamin Rush, wrote, “Th e American 
war is over, but this is far from the case with the American Revolution. 
On the contrary, nothing but the fi rst act of the great drama is closed.” 
For the generation that had lived through the 1760s and 1770s, opportunities 
abounded to help shape the new nation they had created. When Congress 
adopted the offi cial seal of the new nation (found today on the back of every 
dollar bill), they included the Latin phrase Novus Ordo Seclorum , “a new 
order of the ages.” Th omas Paine wrote, “We have it in our power to begin 
the world over again.” Many in the new United States of America thought 
they could do just that. 
The revolutionary leaders—Washington, Adams, Jefferson—have 
become cardboard characters. Their words have been invoked too often, 
their deeds too sanitized. But if today’s citizens are to make sense of the 
Revolution and the creation of a new nation, they need to see those leaders 
as real. In addition, people today need to realize that many other actors 
were also asserting their place in—or, in the case of American Indians and 
Loyalists, on the margins of—the new nation. Th ose known as the “founding 
fathers” were far from the only actors. Women who had lived through 
the Revolution were far less willing to leave political or domestic decisions to 
men than their mothers and grandmothers had been. Poor farmers oft en felt 
Having won independence, the new United States faced many crises. In an eff ort to resolve 
some of the tensions, some of the nation’s leaders proposed a new form of government and 
met in Philadelphia over the long hot summer of 1787 to produce a new Constitution.

State conventions adopt the Constitution 
that their grievances had not been addressed by independence, and they continued to 
complain. Even among those who led the Revolution itself, there were great diff erences 
of opinion, especially regarding the best ways to govern the new nation and to maintain 
the liberty for which they had fought. What that new order would look like depended 
on not only where one stood in 1783 but also where one had stood before and during 
the Revolution. Exploring the eff orts that helped create a stable and strong nation 
out of 13 British colonies requires, fi rst, understanding what the end of the Revolution 
meant for diff erent groups of people who found themselves in diff erent circumstances. 
THE STATE OF THE NATION AT WAR’S END 
Explain how the outcome of the American Revolution affected different groups in the new 
United States. 
For people of all classes, races, and political persuasions in British North America, 
the Revolution brought extensive change. Great inequality remained, but few people 
were willing to defend it as they had in the colonial era. Despite Abigail Adams’s 
plea to her husband John that the Continental Congress should “remember the 
ladies” or Jeff erson’s assertions about the evils of slavery in his original draft s of the 
Declaration of Independence, sexism, slavery, and many forms of inequality survived 
the Revolution intact. Nevertheless, something had changed. No form of inequality 
survived the separation from Great Britain untouched. Forces had been unleashed, 
intended or not, that would undermine oppression. Th omas Paine, ever the optimistic 
recorder of events, wrote, “We see with other eyes; we hear with other ears, and think 
with other thoughts, than those we formerly used.” And he explained that freedom, 
to him, meant “ perfect equality.…Th e fl oor of Freedom is as level as water.” Not all of 
his contemporaries wanted “perfect equality,” but passive acceptance of inequality or 
hierarchy was much less common aft er the Revolution. 
For the Revolutionary Army Offi cers: The Newburgh Conspiracy 
Th e American experiment in creating an independent nation that would be a democracy , 
governed by the will of the majority—or at least the white male majority—almost died 
before it was born. During the long months between the victory at Yorktown in late 1781 
and the treaty that ended the war in March 1783, the army that had won the war came close 
to a military takeover of the government—a coup d’état and a military dictatorship. Once 
the army had won its fi nal battle, the Continental Congress asked the soldiers to wait. And 
the army, especially the offi cers, did not wait patiently in the year and a half that followed. 
By the spring of 1783, the soldiers and offi cers had many reasons for complaint. 
The northern army was in barracks in Newburgh, New York. They were bored. By 
December 1782, they had not been paid for months. Pensions that the Congress 
had promised looked like they might never be paid. General Alexander McDougall 
and Colonels John Brooks and Matthias Ogden took a petition from Newburgh to 
the Congress in Philadelphia that said, “We have borne all that men can bear—our 
property is expended—our private resources are at an end, and our friends are wearied 
out and disgusted with our incessant applications.” Borrowing money from friends to 
survive did not sit well with these offi cers. Th ey warned that “any further experiments 
on their [the army’s] patience may have fatal eff ects.” 
The petition arrived in Philadelphia at a crucial moment. The new nation 
was governed by the Articles of Confederation that had been adopted during the 
Revolution. Under the Articles, which did ensure a democratic government, led by a 
Congress of representatives elected by the voters of the 13 states, the national government 
could not levy taxes or raise funds without the unanimous approval of all the 
states. In late 1782, some of the states had rejected a proposal to tax imports. Alexander 
Hamilton wrote, “Without certain revenues, a government can have no power.” 
Th e government that received the petition from the offi cers was in just that situation.

6.1 
Th ose in the Congress who supported the idea of a more powerful central government 
used the army’s petition to demand that the Congress be given the power to tax 
so it could raise its own funds and not have to depend on the generosity of state legislatures. 
Th ese Federalists, who in the next decade formed the nucleus of the Federalist 
Party, led by Alexander Hamilton, made it clear to the army’s representatives that they 
needed to support the move to give the Congress the power to tax if they were ever going 
to get paid. Th e other main faction in Congress, however—leaders who later became the 
Republican-Democrat Party that emerged in the 1790s—feared maintaining a standing 
army and opposed a larger government fueled by national taxes. Th ey wanted to maintain 
the national government just as it was—as a weak alliance of individually strong states. 
Deadlock followed. It was a dangerous moment. Th e threat by the army’s offi cers 
to use force was real. Th ey had been promised payment. Congress had now linked the 
payments to other agendas and postponed action. While most of those in the army were 
angry, there were also signifi cant diff erences among them. A group of young offi cers were 
ready for action. Th ey thought that George Washington was far too moderate. Th eir hero 
was Horatio Gates, who had led the victory at Saratoga and who disliked Washington. 
Some around Gates, perhaps in consultation with some Federalists in Congress, began 
planning for a military takeover of the new Republic. In March 1783, Major John 
Armstrong, Jr., published the fi rst of what were called the “Newburgh Addresses,” anonymously 
belittling the “milk and water style” and “meek language” of the previous petitions 
to Congress and calling for a meeting of the offi cers to discuss the situation. 
General Washington was horrifi ed. Military action would undermine everything 
for which he and the officers had fought. But Washington was a crafty politician. 
He simply asked the offi cers to postpone their meeting by a few days, invited Gates 
to preside, and requested a full report, implying that he would not be there. The 
officers who wanted action thought they had won and that they could meet with 
Washington’s blessing. 
But when Gates called the meeting to order, Washington entered the room and 
requested permission to speak. Th ough he was furious, Gates knew he could not 
refuse Washington in front of the other officers. Washington then attacked the 
anonymous “Newburgh Addresses” as “unmilitary” and “subversive of all order and 
discipline.” He reminded the offi cers, “I have been…the constant companion and 
witness of your distresses.” Would the army, he asked, contemplate attacking the 
Congress? “My God!” he said, “What can this writer have in view,” by recommending 
such measures? 
Th e speech worked. Th e offi cers cheered Washington. All threat of military action 
against the weak civil government was over. Congress voted to give a lump sum payment 
to all the offi cers who had been promised a pension and passed a tax on imports 
to pay off the national debt, including the debt to the army. 
Th e so-called Newburgh Conspiracy was defeated. In November, the last British 
troops left New York City, and the American offi cers and their troops marched into 
the city and began its transition to civilian leadership. Instead of seizing power, the 
Continental Army began to disband, with payment as promised. Washington made a 
triumphal entry into the city and, on December 4, 1783, gave an emotional farewell to 
his offi cers. He then returned to civilian life at his home in Mount Vernon, Virginia. 
By January 1784, the army had shrunk to some 600 soldiers, ensuring a transition to 
civilian rule. 
For Poor White Farmers: Shays’s Rebellion 
Like the offi cers of the Continental Army, the poor of colonial society—now the poor 
of the new nation—were also unhappy, in some cases violently unhappy. Some had 
served as enlisted soldiers in the Revolutionary army and had their own complaints 
about salaries. Beginning in 1784, the infl ux of imported goods that came with the 
war’s end created an economic depression that hit hardest those who were already

Chapter 6 Creating a Nation 165 
poor. The most famous response to this unhappiness in the first years of the new 
Republic took place in Massachusetts and came to be known as Shays’s Rebellion , 
named for one of its leaders, Daniel Shays. Th ose who participated in the rebellion 
called themselves Regulators—not to be confused with those in the Carolinas who 
had taken the law into their own hands before the Revolution, but simply people who 
wanted to regulate the power of the new state governments. 
In 1786, farmers in western Massachusetts began petitioning the state legislature 
for relief from economic hardships brought on by a signifi cant increase in their taxes 
as the legislature tried to pay off Revolutionary War debts and by the postwar economic 
depression that reduced the value of farm products. For farmers who were 
used to being self-suffi cient, the reduction in their income and demands for taxes to 
be paid in cash were too much to accept. Th ey were being threatened with foreclosure 
and their way of life was being destroyed because they could not raise the money 
demanded of them. Th ey had to do something. 
When faced with the petitions of the farmers, the Massachusetts legislature, dominated 
by commercial leaders from the eastern part of the state, blamed the farmers 
for their own plight. In response, the farmers decided on direct action. Th ey simply 
stopped the courts from issuing foreclosure rulings. On August 29, 1786, 1,500 farmers 
armed with clubs and muskets shut down the court in Northampton as it attempted to 
hear cases. Th ey also stopped courts in four other towns. 
Th e governor and legislature reacted by passing a Riot Act that prohibited 12 or 
more armed persons from gathering and authorized county sheriff s to kill those who 
disobeyed the law. Th ey also suspended the writ of habeas corpus and authorized the 
governor to arrest and hold without bail “any person or persons whatsoever.” 
Shays’s Rebellion 
An armed movement of debt-ridden farmers 
in western Massachusetts in the winter of 
1786–87 who objected to the state’s effort 
to tax them to pay off the Revolutionary 
War debt. 
Having led the American army through the hard years of the Revolutionary War and ensured a transition to 
civilian government, George Washington said farewell to many of the offi cers who had served with him. He 
retired to Mount Vernon in December 1783.

But the farmers, many of whom had fought as soldiers in the Revolution, were 
prepared to fi ght a second time for their rights as free citizens. From their perspective, 
the Massachusetts legislature was acting like the former royal governor. Shays 
and several thousand of his fellow citizens now took up arms, fearing for “our lives 
and families which will be taken from us if we don’t defend them.” 
By January 1787, the Regulators had decided to overthrow the government of 
Massachusetts. Shays himself planned to attack the federal arsenal in Springfi eld and 
then march to Boston to “destroy the nest of devils, who by their infl uence, make the 
Court enact what they please, burn it and lay the town of Boston in ashes.” He came 
close to succeeding. 
By late January, thousands of well-armed farmers surrounded the federal arsenal in 
Springfi eld, which was defended by 1,000 state militia under the command of Major 
General William Shepard. Unfortunately for the rebellion, diff erent groups thought 
the assault was set for diff erent days, and so on January 25, as a smaller group than 
expected marched on the arsenal, Shepard’s troops fired over their heads but then 
directly into their ranks. Four or fi ve were killed, and the rest retreated. Th ey did not 
immediately give up their idea of overthrowing the state government, but no other 
attack came as close to doing so.

Arms in Revolt Against Taxes, 1786 
Shays’s Rebellion, an uprising of poor farmers who were in danger of losing their land because of increased 
taxes, symbolized the discontent that many Americans felt during the economic downturn after the 
Revolution, but it also struck fear into many other Americans who believed the nation was on the edge of 
anarchy and needed a much stronger central government to deal with matters. 

6.1 
6.2 
Chapter 6 Creating a Nation 167 
As 1787 wore on, the rebellion slowly ended. Th e Regulators had few friends in the 
government of Massachusetts or the surrounding states and were not able to establish 
a political base. In 1788, the economy began to recover, which made life more tolerable 
for farmers. Some of the rebels left Massachusetts for more remote places. Shays himself 
settled in Vermont. But the rebels had terrifi ed the nation’s elite and hastened the 
movement toward a stronger national government. 
Fears of the rebellion in Massachusetts inspired other revolutionary leaders to act. 
When he fi rst heard news of Shays’s Rebellion, Washington told Henry Lee of Virginia 
that the rebellion was “proof of what our trans-Atlantic foe has predicted…that mankind 
when left to themselves are unfi t for their own Government.” But, despite their 
worries, men like Washington and Lee were determined not to let such a proof stand. 
Th e convention that met in Philadelphia in the summer of 1787 was a direct result. 
For White Settlers Moving West 
Th e new nation was huge compared to the territorial size of the European powers. Th e 
Treaty of Paris recognized the eastern border of the United States as running along the 
Atlantic coast from Maine to Georgia. Since Britain had returned Florida to Spain at 
the end of the Revolutionary War, the new nation was cut off from the Gulf of Mexico, 
and Spain was not always a friendly southern neighbor. Th e Treaty of Paris also made 
the eastern shore of the Mississippi River the nation’s western boundary. Th e British 
proclamation line that had protected Indian tribes in the Ohio region and caused so 
much tension was not mentioned in the treaty. Control of the Mississippi River itself— 
the right to travel on it—would remain contested, especially since the river ended at 
the city of New Orleans, which Spain zealously guarded (see Map 6-1 ). 
Within this vast territory, the 13 states hugged the Atlantic coast. American 
Indians dominated the interior, but without even the modest protection from white 
settlers that Britain had provided. More whites were crossing the mountains and 
claiming western lands despite the lack of government approval and the dangers of 
Indian attack. Royal charters gave many of the states’ claims to lands far into the interior. 
But soon aft er the Revolution ended, the Continental Congress began resolving 
confl icting land claims and creating new states and territories west 
of the original 13 states. 
One of the fi rst issues to be resolved was over the confl icting 
claims of New York and New Hampshire to the land on the eastern 
side of Lake Champlain. Many of the whites who had settled 
the region wanted independence from both. Local heroes, such 
as Ethan Allen and his Green Mountain Boys, had fought for the 
American cause in the region and wanted to control their home. As 
a result, Vermont became the fi rst new state in 1791 (see Map 6-2 ). 
One of the most signifi cant accomplishments of the Congress 
that operated under the Articles of Confederation was the creation 
of the Northwest Territory out of lands claimed by Pennsylvania, 
New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts. Between 1784 and 
1787, Congress set up territorial governments for what would 
become Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin. It took 
years of difficult negotiations before the original states gave up 
their confl icting claims to the interior lands, but ordinances passed 
between 1784 and 1787 created a new structure for the future 
Midwest. In 1785, Congress ordered that the lands be surveyed, set 
off into a grid pattern with most sections to be sold, while some 
were reserved for future government needs and specifi cally for the 
support of schools. Th e grid system established in 1785 was used 
in future territories, creating clear and well-organized boundaries 
for farms and towns, but encouraging widely dispersed settlements

MAP 6-2 State Claims to Western Lands. The huge tract of land that the King’s Proclamation Line had 
reserved for Indian tribes before the Revolution became part of the United States in 1783. Diff erent original 
states claimed this land and one of the fi rst duties of Congress was to sort out those confl icting claims. After 
1783 no one in government spoke for the rights of the Native Americans whose land much of the territory 
had been. 
rather than compact communities (see Map 6-3 ). Th e Northwest Ordinance of 1787 
banned slavery in these territories as well as mandating religious freedom and the 
development of public schools. Th e act also declared that “the utmost good faith shall 
always be observed towards the Indians; their lands and property shall never be taken 
from them without their consent,” though little was done to enforce this provision. 
Further south, white settlement was, if anything, proceeding faster. An accomplished 
soldier, hunter, and trapper, Daniel Boone fi rst explored the trans-Appalachian territory 
that would be known as Kentucky in 1767 when it was still off limits to whites. As the 
Revolution was starting in 1775 and the British ability to stop settlement was ebbing, 
Boone blazed the “Wilderness Trail” through the Cumberland Gap in the Appalachians 
and established a settlement he called Boonesborough. During and aft er the war, many 
more settlers followed the Wilderness Trail. Virginia gave up its long-standing claims to 
the region, and the federal government, recognizing that there were already slaves in the 
territory, admitted Kentucky to the union as a slave state in 1792 and Tennessee in 1796. 
The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 
Legislation passed by Congress under the 
Articles of Confederation that provided for 
public schools, the sale of government land,

Territories.

Even further south, the land west of Georgia that would eventually become the 
northern two-thirds of Alabama and Mississippi was organized as the Mississippi 
Territory in 1798, but the territorial government there was ineff ective, and Georgia did 
not give up its own claims until 1802. (Th e southern third of Alabama and Mississippi 
was known as West Florida, part of the Spanish-controlled territory on the country’s 
southern border.) While the Congress tried to settle confl icting claims to the western 
lands, the Indians, who had the oldest claim to the land, had no inclination to give it up. 
For American Indians 
For the federal Congress, the greatest threat to the new United States came from 
American Indians. For most of the tribes who lived between the Atlantic coast and the 
Mississippi River, the end of the American Revolution was one more disaster among 
many. Despite the loyalty of the Iroquois to the British during the Revolution, the king’s 
government agreed to the Treaty of Paris in 1783, which ceded all the lands between 
the Atlantic coast and the Mississippi and south of the Great Lakes and Canada to 
the new United States, without consulting with their old allies. Th e Proclamation Line 
limiting white settlement was gone. Among the many Indian tribes, even among the 
Iroquois, there were diff ering responses to the British failure to honor their loyalty. 
Many Indian leaders saw no reason to honor a treaty in which they had played no part 
and continued to act as if much of New York and Pennsylvania and all lands west of 
the Ohio River belonged to them. 
Under the leadership of Joseph Brant, the Mohawks, who had fought so hard for 
the British between 1776 and 1781, petitioned the British authorities in Quebec for 
land on the British side of the new border and were granted a large tract in Canada. 
But they, like other tribes, did not let an international boundary limit their range of 
hunting or living. New York and Pennsylvania petitioned the Congress for help with 
the Indian tribes on their western frontiers, and the New York legislature considered 
expelling all the tribes of the Six Nations because of their alliance with the British 
during the war (see Map 6-4 ). 
MAP 6-3 The Northwest Territory Grid System. The Northwest Ordinance divided the territory into what 
would become fi ve states. It also created a survey system in which the land would be divided into townships 
made up of 36 “sections,” 35 of which would be available to settlers and one of which would be reserved to 
support schools.

6.1 
Th rough the Treaty of Paris, the British also promised to withdraw from all forts 
south of the Great Lakes. As a result, a power vacuum was looming in the region, 
though the British were slow to honor their commitment to leave their western forts. 
Rather than depend on state militia, Congress in 1783 began to create the U.S. Army to 
occupy Fort Niagara near today’s Buff alo, New York, and Fort Pitt, today’s Pittsburgh. 
Although Congress could create an army, its diffi culty in raising funds meant that the 
Secretary of War, former General Henry Knox, had to beg for money to keep the army 
paid, fed, and supplied, which strengthened the hand of Indian leaders committed to 
resisting white expansion. And many meant to resist. 
Th e Iroquois were far from the only Indians who began to resist American expansion 
violently. Th ese tribes had never formally agreed to peace with the new nation, 
and they attacked both the army and the settlers. The small battles—individual 
attacks, kidnappings, and destruction of property—continued as they had during the 
Revolution. Th e U.S. Army was far too small, ill-trained, and ill-supplied to be much 
of a deterrent. Given how weak the army was, the Indians held the upper hand in the 
Northwest Territory and Kentucky. 
A temporary peace along the New York border was secured in October 1784 by the 
Treaty of Fort Stanwix between some of the Iroquois and the U.S. government. But 
many, including Sagoyewatha (Red Jacket) of the Seneca and Joseph Brant opposed 
the treaty, and it did not hold. In fact, the Indians of the Northwest Territory would 
remain virtually at war with the United States from 1785 until 1795.

MAP 6-4 Ohio in the 1780s. The land that would later become the state of Ohio was a battlefi eld in the 
1780s. While Great Britain included the land as part of the newly independent United States in 1783, in 
reality Native American tribes were the dominant force in the region and they often received aid from their 
Canadian-based British allies.

Chapter 6 Creating a Nation 171 
Aft er the Treaty of Fort Stanwix was signed, Brant sailed for London where he 
met with many high-ranking British offi cials and had an audience with King George 
III. He sought fi nancial support for his people as compensation for their role on the 
British side in the Revolution, and he—and his British hosts—also seem to have developed 
a plan for Indian resistance to the new American nation. 
In 1785 and 1786, Brant began to create an Indian confederation that could successfully 
resist the United States. Th e confederation included not only representatives 
of the Iroquois but also many other tribes who had been traditional enemies of the 
Iroquois as well as Cherokees from much further south and smaller tribes who resided 
in the Ohio River Valley. It would be one of the most unifi ed and eff ective adversaries 
that the United States would face. Th e Indians demanded that the Congress ensure 
that white settlement ended at the Ohio River. 
While the Indians and Congress negotiated fi tfully, the frontier remained a violent 
place. In the late 1780s, 1,500 white settlers and at least as many Indians in Ohio and 
Kentucky were killed (see Map 6-5 ). Th e United States had no intention of ceding as much 
land to the Indians as they demanded, but under the Articles of Confederation, it was diffi 
cult to organize an army to enforce the government’s claims. Th e need to create a government 
strong enough to counter the Indians led many to support the Constitution in 1787. 
For Slaves, Former Slaves, and Those Who Claimed Ownership 
of Them 
In 1791, Benjamin Banneker, a free African-American whose parents had been slaves, 
wrote to Th omas Jeff erson, then Washington’s secretary of state, reminding him that in 
1776 Jeff erson had written, “that all men are created equal, and that they are endowed 
by their creator with certain inalienable rights.” Banneker continued: 
[B]ut sir, how pitiable is it to reflect that although you were so fully convinced 
of the benevolence of the Father of mankind…you should…counteract 
his mercies, in detaining by fraud and violence so numerous a part of my 
brethren, under groaning captivity and cruel oppression, that you should…be 
found guilty of that most criminal act, which you professedly detested in others, 
with respect to yourselves. 
Banneker would not let Jefferson forget the contradiction at the heart of the new 
American enterprise and Jeff erson’s own life. 
As Banneker’s letter indicates, many slaves and former slaves understood that the 
words freedom and liberty also ought to count for them. By the end of the Revolution, 
many whites agreed. Back in 1775, Th omas Paine asked how Americans could complain 
about British tyranny “while they hold so many hundreds of thousands in slavery?” 
Th e issue of freedom and liberty seemed to be gaining ground for some slaves aft er 
1776. News traveled slowly, but word spread that in 1794, in the midst of the French 
Revolution, the French National Convention had abolished slavery, and then that 
slaves in France’s most lucrative Caribbean colony had won independence for what 
became the black-led Republic of Haiti. 
When Cornwallis surrendered at Yorktown in 1781, he had between 4,000 and 
5,000 former slaves with his army. Many more were in other British-held areas, especially 
New York City. As the war ended, the British returned some slaves to old masters, 
gave others to new masters in the Caribbean, or simply abandoned them. But many 
former slaves also sailed with the British when they left the colonies, some settling as 
free people in Canada, England, or West Africa. A former slave named Boston King 
wrote that, “Th e English had compassion upon us in the day of distress. Soon aft er, 
ships were fi tted out, and furnished with every necessary for conveying us to Nova 
Scotia.” Life was not easy for African-Americans in Nova Scotia, but they were free. 
By the time George Washington was inaugurated president in 1789, slavery had 
been abolished in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Vermont and was dying— 
though slowly—throughout the north. Northern slaves worked as household help and 
Joseph Brant, or Thayendanegea, was a leader 
among the Mohawks, who convinced many in the 
Iroquois federation to support the British cause 
during the Revolution and oppose American 
expansion after the war, as he negotiated for 
Native American rights. He was one of the very 
few people of any race to meet with both George 
Washington and King George III.

MAP 6-5 Tribal Land Claims-1783–1788. Especially in the southwest of the new United States, strong 
Native American tribes clamed large areas and did not much care whether the U.S. or Spain claimed the 
territory since that did not want settlers from either country. 
labored in factories and farms. New York had the most slaves in the north, concentrated 
in Manhattan but also working on the great estates of the Hudson Valley. New 
Jersey and Rhode Island were next in number. In the north, however, more money 
was made on the slave trade than on slave labor. Th e Northwest Ordinance prohibited 
slavery in the Ohio region. Many thought slavery would also die out in Delaware, 
Maryland, and Virginia. Only in the Carolinas, Georgia, and the new western areas of 
Kentucky and Tennessee was slavery still strong. 
Despite the regional diff erences, by 1789, one in 10 African-Americans was a free 
person. Some had won their freedom through the army. Some had won through state 
action. Some had been set free by individual slave owners. But in 1789, one could not 
assume that to be black was to be a slave. Th at truth was a signifi cant change from 
1776 when free blacks were a defi nite exception in every one of the 13 colonies. 

6.1

Chapter 6 Creating a Nation 173 
After Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Vermont abolished slavery, other 
northern states with more slaves moved exceedingly slowly toward gradual emancipation 
( Table 6-1 ). Th e Pennsylvania law of 1780 declared slavery “disgraceful to any people,” 
but then set up a system in which the fi rst slaves would not be freed until 1808 and the 
last would not be emancipated until 1847. New York’s abolition law of 1799 and New 
Jersey’s of 1804, as well as similar laws in Connecticut and Rhode Island, were equally 
slow in their operations. Although every northern state had started the process of ending 
slavery before 1800, it was almost 1850 before slavery disappeared in the north. 
Free blacks sometimes found work in the same households where they had been 
slaves. Black men worked on merchant ships, whaling vessels, or even in the navy. 
(The racially diverse crew of the whaling ship Pequod in Herman Melville’s 1851 
novel Moby Dick was not unusual.) In Philadelphia, New York, Providence, and 
Boston, many blacks worked on the docks. Th roughout the northern states more and 
more free blacks referred to themselves as Africans or, as the Free African Society of 
Philadelphia said, “free Africans and their descendants.” 
In the region encompassing Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina, 
slavery did not die out, but slave life changed after the Revolution. Some masters 
heeded the revolutionary language of freedom. James Madison freed one slave named 
Billy because he came to fear that Billy’s love of freedom meant he was no longer “a fi t 
companion for fellow slaves.” George Washington wrote oft en of his wish that slavery 
could be gradually abolished and left instructions in his will that all his slaves should 
be free aft er he and Martha died. Other planters in the region also freed slaves. Slaves 
who had run away during the war managed to establish new identities and maintain 
their freedom, especially in cities like Baltimore, Richmond, and the new District of 
Columbia. By 1810, almost a quarter of the African-Americans in Maryland, a third in 
the District of Columbia, and six or seven percent in Virginia and North Carolina were 
free. A thriving community of free people of African descent emerged. As a sign of 
their growing confi dence, in 1792, Th omas Brown, a black Revolutionary War veteran 
in Baltimore, ran, although unsuccessfully, for the Maryland legislature, promising to 
“represent so many hundreds of poor Blacks.”

In this region, slaves and free blacks worked in an economy that was more 
diverse than before the war. By 1790, slaves in Virginia and Maryland, for example, 
were increasingly engaged in growing wheat, a crop that required horses that needed 
tending, plows, and fertilizer. They also worked in flour mills and the ironworks, 
blacksmith shops, and other enterprises that were springing up in the region. Some 
slaves were “rented out” and moved from job to job, giving them a chance to learn 
more skills, travel short distances, make a little money, and gain a taste of freedom. 
Other slaves from the region were far less fortunate. In the years after the 
Revolution, with the plantations of Virginia and Maryland stabilized in size, slave 
owners needed fewer slaves. So they increased their wealth by developing a new internal 
market in humans. Th ey encouraged slaves to have more children and then, as 
those children reached adolescence, sold them, as they sold other agricultural products, 
for transport to places that needed more and more slave labor. Slaves were taken 
to join the white settlers who established the new states of Kentucky and Tennessee. 
Other slaves were transported to South Carolina and Georgia. 
Further south, in South Carolina and Georgia, life for slaves was very diff erent. 
Some of the fi ercest fi ghting of the Revolution had disrupted almost every aspect of 
life in South Carolina and Georgia, and slaves had more opportunities to run away. 
With the coming of peace, however, the planter elite in these states was determined to 
reestablish a way of life that depended on slavery. Slaves represented between 40 and 
Born a slave, Prince Hall was freed before the Revolution, and 
after the war he played a leading role in abolishing slavery in 
Massachusetts. Hall helped create the African Lodge of the Masons in 
Boston and delivered the following speech to that group. He makes it 
clear that although African-Americans in his city are free, they are far 
from equal; still, he urges his audience to take heart at the promise of 
freedom seen in the revolution in Haiti. 
Now, my brethren, nothing is stable; all things are changeable. 
Let us seek those things which are sure and steadfast, and 
let us pray God that, while we remain here, he would give us the 
grace of patience and strength to bear up under all our troubles, 
which, at this day, God knows, we have our share of. Patience, I 
say; for were we not possessed of a great measure of it, we could 
not bear up under the daily insults we meet with in the streets 
of Boston, much more on public days of recreation. How, at such 
times, are we shamefully abused, and that to such a degree that 
we may truly be said to carry our lives in our hands, and the 
arrows of death are flying about our heads. Helpless women have 
their clothes torn from their backs.…I was told by a gentleman 
who saw this filthy behavior in the Common that, in all places he 
had been in, he never saw so cruel behavior in all his life; and that 
a slave in the West Indies on Sundays or holidays enjoys himself 
and friends without molestation.… 
My brethren, let us not be cast down under these and 
many other abuses we at present are laboring under, for the 
darkest hour is just before the break of day. My brethren, let us 
remember what a dark day it was with our African brethren, six 
years ago, in the French West Indies. Nothing but the snap of the 
whip was heard, from morning to evening. Hanging, breaking 
on the wheel, burning and all manner of tortures were inflicted 
upon those unhappy people. But, blessed be God, the scene is 
changed. They now confess that God hath no respect of person 
and, therefore, receive them as their friends and treat them as 
brothers. Thus doth Ethiopia stretch forth her hand from slavery, 
to freedom and equality.

60 percent of the population in South Carolina and Georgia. Slave labor had produced 
great fortunes for the plantation owners before the war, and it would produce new 
fortunes for them aft er the war ended. 
Whereas many planters in Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina 
felt the need to consider the rhetoric of freedom and perhaps modify the tyranny of 
slavery, planters in South Carolina and Georgia made it clear that they believed such 
language did not apply to slaves. As a result, the few free blacks in the southernmost 
states, oft en people who had black, white, and Indian heritage, were kept as far away 
from the slave community as possible so the slaves would not hear the contagious language 
of freedom. 
In the 20 years aft er 1790, the number of slaves doubled in South Carolina from 
100,000 to 200,000, and in Georgia it more than tripled from 30,000 to over 100,000. 
Th e rapid growth of the slave population in South Carolina and Georgia at the end of 
the 1700s also led to a new kind of community life in the slave quarters of these large 
plantations. Unlike those who owned a lone slave or a single slave family, which could 
be closely supervised, the largest plantations in South Carolina and Georgia had hundreds 
of slaves in the 1790s. Slave labor created great wealth, and the owners of these 
plantations were the economic elite of their states, but they were oft en away, preferring 
the social life of Charleston or Savannah. Slaves, though driven by overseers, were able 
to develop their own community lives and norms within the slave quarters, which had 
not been possible on the smaller farms and plantations of an earlier era. Having their 
own vegetable gardens sometimes gave slaves limited economic freedom. Religious 
gatherings provided communal support. 
For Women: The Rise of Republican Motherhood 
In April 1776, Abigail Adams wrote to her husband John while the future president 
was attending the Congress that would issue the Declaration of Independence in 
Philadelphia and she was managing the family and farm in Quincy, Massachusetts, 
from which he was so oft en absent. She told him to “remember the ladies.” And she 
warned, “Do not put such unlimited power into the hands of husbands.…If particular 
care and attention is not paid to the ladies we are determined to foment a rebellion, 
and will not hold ourselves bound by any laws in which we have no voice or representation.” 
Abigail was quite serious in her demand. Her husband, however, treated his 
wife’s plea as a kind of joke. John Adams wrote back to his wife saying, “Our struggle 
has loosened the bonds of government everywhere; that children and apprentices were 
disobedient,” but, he said, Abigail’s letter “was the fi rst intimation that another tribe, 
more numerous and powerful than all the rest, were grown discontented.” We do not 
know how she responded to having her husband lump her plea for a voice in government 
with the discontent of children and apprentices. Abigail and John had a close 
marriage, but while she was serious about wanting the American Revolution to recognize 
more rights for women, he was equally determined to ignore her plea. 
Women, of course, fell into all of the diff erent groups that men did. American 
Indian women, most of whom like the men had supported the British, oft en paid a 
high price for their loyalty to Britain. Mary (Molly) Brant, the sister of Joseph Brant, 
convinced many Iroquois to support an Iroquois-British alliance during the war. 
When the war ended, she found a new home in Canada, reminding the British authorities 
that they were not providing the support they had promised her people. 
Slave women also sided with the British more often than with the American 
Revolutionaries. With British armies operating in the southern colonies, and the 
British welcoming slaves to their side, women as well as men fl ed to freedom with the 
British. Of the 23 slaves who ran away from Th omas Jeff erson’s plantations during 
the Revolution, 13 were female. More than 40 percent of all of the former slaves who 
left with the British at the end of the war were women.

6.1 
Some white women—rich and poor—also supported the British cause and paid 
dearly for it. With the coming of the war, many Loyalist wives stayed behind to mind 
their homes when their husbands joined the British army or fl ed to Canada. Th ese 
women faced hostile neighbors and local governments, and many lost their homes. 
For white women who supported the Revolution, life was also hard, but the 
outcome was usually better. Th e Revolutionary War shaped the lives of most women 
who had supported it. For some, it changed virtually every aspect of life. Aft er the war, 
Deborah Sampson who had pretended to be a man and fought in the war, married and 
lived in Sharon, Massachusetts, but she was also entertained by President Washington, 
was granted a revolutionary soldier’s pension by Congress, and became something of 
a national hero. Other women did not easily return to their old ways, limited to the 
private sphere of their families. With many men away for months or years, women 
took on household duties that were, by long tradition, men’s exclusive sphere. Mary 
Bartlett, whose husband represented New Hampshire in Congress, refl ected a changed 
attitude experienced by many. In her fi rst letters in 1776, she wrote about “Your farming 
business,” but by 1778, it had become “our farming business.” Th e diff erence of 
one word that made it clear she now included herself in the ownership of their farm 
was an important change. 
Many women who had coped with years of isolation during the war found that the 
political independence of the United States brought personal independence, too. More 
women postponed marriage, demanded divorces from unhappy marriages, and sought 
higher education as well as new—if limited—political involvement in the new republic. 
For many Americans, women and men, the book, A Vindication of the Rights 
of Woman, written in 1792 by British writer Mary Wollstonecraft, gave words to 
ideas that had been taking shape since the Revolution. In her appeal for equality, 
Wollstonecraft called for equal education, and coeducation, for girls and boys. In 
America, Judith Sargent Murray expanded Wollstonecraft ’s arguments and insisted 
that women are indeed “in every respect equal to men.” 
Important as they were, the ideas about total equality developed by 
Wollstonecraft and Murray did not become the dominant ideology of the 
new nation. Instead, something much more moderate, known as Republican 
Motherhood , came to dominate public discussions of women’s place in the new 
United States. As the ideology of Republican Motherhood was developed in pulpits 
and magazines aft er the Revolution, women would have an important role, but a 
limited one—not full citizenship but also no return to a merely passive role in the 
domestic sphere that had been prescribed before 1776. Republican Motherhood 
was a kind of middle position. Its advocates suggested that women would advise 
their husbands and raise their sons to be active citizens and their daughters to be 
part of another generation of republican mothers who shaped the nation from 
home. But to play this role, its advocates insisted that women also needed an 
education, perhaps a diff erent education from men, but a better one than that given 
to their mothers and grandmothers. 
In 1778, Abigail Adams wrote, “I regret…how fashionable it has been to ridicule 
Female learning.” Aft er the war, she and many others planned to do something about 
it. Private academies, which had educated white male leaders for a century, began to 
open their doors to women, or more often, separate private academies for women 
were founded like the Young Ladies’ Academy of Philadelphia that Benjamin Rush 
opened in 1787. Rush, whose views refl ected his belief in the ideology of Republican 
Motherhood, believed that the “attention of our young ladies should be directed as 
soon as they are prepared for it to the reading of history, travels, poetry, and moral 
essays…to the present state of society in America.” When Priscilla Mason graduated 
from Rush’s Young Ladies’ Academy in 1794, however, she condemned the arbitrary 
limitations that “have denied us the means of knowledge, and then reproached us for 
the want of it.” She continued, “Th e Church, the Bar, and the Senate are shut against us. 
Republican Motherhood 
The belief that women should have more 
rights and a better education so that they 
might support husbands and raise sons who 
would actively participate in the political 
affairs of society. 
Having lived through the Revolution in 
Massachusetts and become a leader in the 
Universalist churches, Judith Sargent Murray also 
came to be one of the strongest voices demanding 
absolute equality for women in the new nation.

Who shut them? Man, despotic man.” An education that produced such a speaker, may 
have been more than Rush envisioned when he proposed the school. 
Women also took a more direct role in politics when they could. New Jersey’s 
1776 Constitution gave women the right to vote, but the provision was repealed in 
1807. Th e Bill of Rights that was added to the federal Constitution in 1791 gave all citizens—
women as well as men—the right to “petition the government for a redress of 
grievances,” and women regularly petitioned Congress and state legislatures. Aft er the 
Revolution, women also gained signifi cant new rights to control their own property, 
which they had not had before the war. It would be a long time before law and culture 
would support the equality that Abigail Adams or Judith Sargent Murray advocated. 
But attitudes had begun to change. 
Within the ideology of Republican Motherhood, however, two double standards 
emerged. First, middle- and upper-class white women were expected to be the guardians 
of sexual morality. Men might stray, but, as a Philadelphia newspaper editorialized, 
“Ladies, much depends on you, towards a reformation in the morals of our sex.” 
And if men did stray, it was expected they would do so only with lower-class or poor 
white women or with blacks, slave or free. Second, servants and working women were 
Judith Sargent Murray was born into a merchant family in 
Massachusetts in 1751 and lived through the Revolution as a 
young woman. She was a leader of the Universalist movement in religion, 
which believed that all people were saved, a belief that led them 
to emphasize equality, including equality of the sexes. She argued 
that differences between the sexes were due to educational opportunities 
rather than inherent qualities, and she wanted an education 
that would make women the equals of their brothers, husbands, and 
sons. She argued that the way society constructed women’s roles 
perpetuated the stereotype of women as overly emotional and not 
thoughtful. With an equal education, she insisted, women could at 
least equal men. Her most famous book, On the Equality of the Sexes, 
was published in 1792. 
Is it upon mature consideration we adopt the idea, that nature 
is thus partial in her distributions? Is it indeed a fact, that she 
hath yielded to one half of the human species so unquestionable 
a mental superiority?…May we not trace its source in the difference 
of education…the one is taught to aspire, and the other is 
early confined and limited. As their years increase, the sister must 
be wholly domesticated, while the brother is led by the hand 
through all the flowery paths of science. Grant that their minds 
are by nature equal, yet who shall wonder at the apparent superiority, 
if indeed custom becomes second nature.… At length 
arrived at womanhood, the uncultivated fair one feels a void, 
which the employments allotted her are by no means capable of 
filling.…She experiences a mortifying consciousness of inferiority, 
which embitters every enjoyment.…Now, was she permitted 
the same instructors as her brother, (with an eye however to their 
particular departments) for the employment of a rational mind 
an ample field would be opened.…A mind, thus filled, would 
have little room for the trifles with which our sex are, with too 
much justice, accused of amusing themselves, and they would 
thus be rendered fit companions for those, who should one day 
wear them as their crown.… 
Should it still be vociferated, “Your domestic employments are 
sufficient”—I would calmly ask, is it reasonable, that a candidate 
for immortality, for the joys of heaven, an intelligent being, who is 
to spend an eternity in contemplating the works of Deity, should 
at present be so degraded, as to be allowed no other ideas, than 
those which are suggested by the mechanism of a pudding, or 
the sewing the seams of a garment? Pity that all such censurers 
of female improvement do not go one step further, and deny 
their future existence; to be consistent they surely ought. 
Yes, ye lordly, ye haughty sex, our souls are by nature equal 
to yours; the same breath of God animates, enlivens, and invigorates 
us; and that we are not fallen lower than yourselves.

CREATING A GOVERNMENT: WRITING THE U.S. CONSTITUTION 
Explain the needs, pressures, and compromises that led to writing and adopting the 
Constitution. 
Th e years immediately aft er the Revolution were not easy ones in the new United States of 
America. Many Americans were unhappy with the situation in which they found themselves. 
Farmers were angry about taxes. Frontier whites and Indians fought for control 
of the land. Many women were agitating for their own rights. Some of the most famous 
revolutionary leaders, including Washington, Franklin, and Hamilton, were determined 
to end the growing chaos and reshape the new nation they had helped to create. 
The Crisis of the 1780s: The Failure of the Articles of Confederation 
The problems that the nation faced in the 1780s had many sources. The Articles 
of Confederation that governed the nation were essentially a treaty among 
13 independent nations. All 13 states needed to agree to levy any taxes, and nine states 
had to agree to pass a law. Real sovereignty—in this case, the ability to make the most 
important decisions about how Americans should govern themselves and pay for their 
government—rested with the state governments.

6.1 
For present-day citizens, who live in a world in which a national government rules 
almost every spot on the planet, such a loose federation may seem surprising. But for 
the revolutionary generation, the arrangement was not strange at all. Th e separate 
colonies had experienced over a century of independent relationships with London. 
Until the 1760s, the links between each colony and Britain were much stronger than 
the ties between the various colonies. When Americans looked to Europe, they saw 
that small independent states and cities were the rule in what is now Germany and 
Italy. In that context, viewing Massachusetts, New York, and Virginia as independent 
states that were linked only in a loose confederation did not seem odd. 
Nevertheless, leading citizens were concluding that the American confederation 
was not working. Th ey believed that it was too weak, the state legislatures too strong, 
and that this imbalance was causing serious problems. Unlike their European models, 
the American confederation had acted as a united front to achieve independence, and 
that eff ort had a ripple eff ect on subsequent actions. Under the treaty that ended the 
Revolution, the United States—all of the states together—had promised to pay debts that 
it had incurred during the war—pensions for soldiers as well as the repayment of loans 
to U.S. citizens and foreign creditors. But Congress had no money and could not seem to 
raise any, given the requirement that all 13 states agree to any tax. Th e credit rating of the 
new nation was dropping quickly, and the lack of faith in the government’s ability to pay 
its debts was strangling the national economy. If the government could not pay off the 
loans negotiated during the Revolution, many European creditors thought, why loan any 
more money to either the American government or American commercial enterprises? 
The financial crisis had additional impacts. Indian tribes along the frontier were 
growing stronger, and the new nation risked losing control of its western lands because 
it could not aff ord a strong army to protect them. In 1785, a Shawnee leader, Piteasewa, 
told commissioners sent by the Congress, “We are aware of your design to divide our 
Councils, but we are unanimous.” Although the tribes were never actually unanimous, in 
the 1780s they were still more than a match for the U.S. Army or the various state militias. 
Moreover, many state legislatures not only failed to raise taxes or pay their state debts 
but also oft en simply gave in when mobs of farmers like those in Massachusetts took 
control of the court houses and stopped trials of those who had failed to pay debts or 
taxes. Charles Lee, one of Virginia’s leading citizens, complained to George Washington 
in 1788 of the legislature’s willingness to grant too much tax relief: “the public debts and 
even private debts will in my opinion be extinguished by acts of the several Legislatures.” 
In September 1786, five states sent delegates to a convention in Maryland— 
known as the Annapolis Convention —to try to deal with yet another weakness of the 
Articles of Confederation—economic rivalry between the states that had led to a battle 
over navigation rights on the Potomac River between Maryland and Virginia and to a 
violent boundary dispute between New York and what would become Vermont. Th e 
convention never had a quorum and did no business, but it did give some leaders a 
chance to talk about the nation’s problems. As a result, Alexander Hamilton wrote to 
the Congress asking that the states appoint delegates to meet in Philadelphia in May 
1787 “to devise such further provisions as should appear to them necessary to render 
the constitution of the federal government adequate to the exigencies of the union.” 
In February 1787, 5 months aft er receiving Hamilton’s letter, the Congress agreed 
to call a convention, but with limitations. Th ey voted to ask the states to send delegates 
to Philadelphia “for the sole and express purpose of revising the Articles of 
Confederation, and reporting to Congress and the several legislatures such alterations 
and provisions therein as shall when agreed to in Congress and confi rmed by 
the States, render the federal Constitution adequate to the exigencies of Government 
and the preservation of the Union.” On the surface, this call was hardly a mandate 
for wholesale change. But it launched the Constitutional Convention of 1787, and the 
Convention would far exceed its authority. Some, including Madison and Hamilton, 
planned it that way from the beginning. Th e result would be a radically diff erent form 
of government than the one under which the United States had won its freedom.

The Constitutional Convention of 1787 
Th e 55 white men who gathered in what later came to be known as Independence 
Hall in Philadelphia in spring of 1787 for the Constitutional Convention had 
instructions from Congress merely to propose amendments to the Articles of 
Confederation. Th e group represented the elite of the new nation. Th ey had been 
appointed by 12 states; Rhode Island’s legislature distrusted any eff ort to strengthen 
the central government and refused to send anyone to Philadelphia. Most were fairly 
young. Twenty-nine had college degrees at a time when that achievement was rare. 
Only eight had signed the Declaration of Independence in 1776. Except for George 
Washington and Benjamin Franklin, some of the most prominent leaders of the 
Revolution were absent. Virginia’s Patrick Henry and Massachusetts’ John Hancock 
and Sam Adams refused to attend because they, too, worried that the convention 
would undermine the rights of individual states. Jeff erson was away as U.S. ambassador 
to France. John Adams was ambassador to Britain. Women and the rebels of 
western Massachusetts who had marched with Daniel Shays, slaves and free blacks, 
and American Indians were not represented. But in that summer gathering in 1787, 
the delegates produced a frame of government that has served the United States well 
for more than 200 years. 
DECISIONS ON THE STRUCTURE OF A UNIFIED GOVERNMENT Coming to 
agreement at the Constitutional Convention involved long arguments and diffi cult 
compromises. The final result that the convention produced in September 1787 
disappointed many. Surprisingly, all the delegates, even those who left in anger, kept to 
a pledge to keep their deliberations secret. All of the delegates wanted to be sure they 
had the time and freedom to talk through the diffi cult issues of the day without undue 
pressure from outside groups. No one outside the convention, including members of 
Congress that were still meeting in New York, had a clue what the distinguished group 
in Philadelphia would recommend.

Convention 
In the spring of 1787, delegates from 12 of the 13 states gathered in Independence Hall—now a national 
historic site—to write a new plan of government. After a summer of hard negotiations, they proposed what 
became the Constitution of the United States.

Chapter 6 Creating a Nation 181 
A relatively young delegate from Virginia, James Madison (1751–1836), who 
had served in the Virginia legislature during the Revolution and had authored the 
Virginia Statute of Religious Freedom, was the key architect of the Constitution 
that emerged, although he never held a special offi ce at the convention. In preparation 
for the convention, Madison privately arranged for the Virginia and 
Pennsylvania delegates to arrive in Philadelphia a week before the convention 
opened. He used that week to craft a plan that could be presented as soon as the 
convention got underway. 
On May 29, the first day of business at the convention, Virginia’s Governor 
Edmund Randolph, following Madison’s plan, presented what came to be known 
as the Virginia Plan —the fi rst outline of a new constitution. In Randolph’s plan, 
a new Congress with two houses, whose members would be elected based on proportional 
representation reflecting the population of the various states, would 
replace the current Congress. Th e new government would represent the people, not 
necessarily 13 equal states. If more people lived in certain states, especially Virginia 
and Massachusetts, then those states would have more votes in the Congress. Th e 
Congress would have the power to levy taxes, regulate interstate commerce, and 
veto state laws. Randolph also proposed creating a “national executive” and judiciary, 
or a set of federal courts. 
Th e next day, May 30, the delegates endorsed a resolution from Pennsylvania’s 
Gouverneur Morris that “a national government ought to be established consisting 
of a supreme legislative, executive, and judiciary.” Th e basic outline of a strong 
new national government—one that included the separation of powers between the 
Congress, the executive branch, and the courts—had emerged quickly. Th e new system 
that Madison, Randolph, and Morris were proposing was also known as federalism , 
a system of government in which both the central national government and the 
individual state governments had real power, but in separate spheres of infl uence. But 
there would be many days of meetings in a hot and stuff y Independence Hall before 
the details would be resolved and the Constitution itself would be completed. 
From the opening day, there was a battle between those, generally from larger 
states, who wanted the new Congress to have proportional representation —that is, 
representatives elected directly by the voters of districts based on the size of a state’s 
population—and those, generally from smaller states, who wanted Congress to be 
made up of representatives of the states themselves, so that each state would have an 
equal number of votes. Th e Virginia Plan called for proportional representation, but 
a subsequent plan put forward by New Jersey’s William Paterson—not surprisingly 
known as the New Jersey Plan —called for a Congress in which both houses would 
be made up of delegates elected by state legislatures with an equal number from 
each state. While the delegates from the largest states, especially James Madison and 
Edmund Randolph, insisted that proportional representation was essential to a strong 
and democratic national government, Paterson, along with delegates from Delaware 
and surprisingly some from New York and Massachusetts, insisted that members 
of Congress should represent only state governments and that each state should be 
treated equally. 
A compromise, first proposed by Connecticut’s Roger Sherman—and sometimes 
called the Connecticut Plan —was to split the diff erence and create a House of 
Representatives with members elected by districts based on population and a Senate 
made up of two senators from each state no matter what its population, elected by 
the state legislature. But adopting this Great Compromise , which was the key to the 
future Constitution, did not come easily. 
Other issues were even more diffi cult to resolve. Th e convention came to a standstill 
over the offi ce of president. Everyone assumed that the convention’s presiding 
offi cer, George Washington, would be the fi rst president in the new government, but 
few could agree on the details of the offi ce or on how to select his successors. Some

guide the convention’s deliberations. His notes on

that summer.

wanted an executive of several individuals in a cabinet of equals, while others insisted 
on a single leader. Most wanted to ensure that only the “wisest and best” citizens voted 
for the president, and almost none trusted the people to elect the president by a direct 
popular vote. But how to select the president—by the Congress, by state legislatures, 
or by some other formula—seemed impossible to resolve until Madison proposed the 
Electoral College . He suggested that each state select presidential electors according 
to the number of its senators and representatives in Congress by whatever method 
it preferred, and that these electors would then select the president. If a majority of 
the electors did not agree on any one candidate, the choice would fall to the House 
of Representatives—but with each state delegation in Congress having only one 
vote. Th is proposal seemed like a compromise that could work. Th e convention also 
decided on a 4-year term for the president, with no limit on the number of terms that 
could be served. 
There were many arguments about how much power to give the president. 
Delegates remembered that they had just fought a war against the tyranny of George 
III’s government. On the other hand, aft er a decade of chaos, they wanted a strong 
executive who could make tough decisions and have the authority to make them stick. 
Th e delegates compromised and agreed that the president could veto legislation, but 
that a two-thirds vote of each chamber of the Congress could override a veto. Th ose 
wanting a strong executive won, though it would fall to Washington and subsequent 
presidents to fl esh out the job. 
Th e delegates spent almost no time on the judiciary. Th ey created a Supreme Court 
and lower courts but left the details to subsequent generations. While they considered 
an arrangement whereby the judges of the Supreme Court and the president together 
might declare both federal and state laws unconstitutional they dropped the idea. 
Only later, aft er John Marshall became chief justice in 1800, did the Supreme Court 
take on its role as arbiter of the constitutionality of laws. 
The Eff ects of Slavery on a Unifi ed Government 
While the convention spent much of its time debating issues that divided large states 
from small ones, Madison understood that the real divide was between northern 
and southern states, or more specifi cally, between states where slavery was growing 
rapidly and those where it was dying out. Later, he remembered that “the institution 
of slavery and its implications formed the line of discrimination” on many issues. 
Th e existence of slavery in the United States embarrassed most of the framers of the 
Constitution. Th ey were careful not to use the words “slave” or “slavery” even once 
in the fi nal document. But they were equally careful to protect the institution and 
appease slaveholders. 
Madison, like his fellow Virginians, Jeff erson and Washington, embodied all 
the contradictions of slavery. Madison owned slaves, yet despised slavery. He 
told the convention that the “distinction of color” represented the basis for “the 
most oppressive domination ever exercised by man over man.” Nevertheless, 
he later assured the Virginia convention that ratified the Constitution that the 
Constitution offered slavery “better security than any that now exists.” He was 
right in his assurance. 
Although many of the delegates, including some who were slaveholders, 
understood that slavery was incompatible with “life, liberty, and the pursuit of 
happiness,” they were willing to live with the contradiction. The framers of the 
Constitution were also willing to live with slavery because of their belief that a key to 
securing life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness was ensuring the inviolable right 
of private property. Slaves were seen, fi rst, as the private property of their owners 
and only second as human beings, if as humans at all. For many at the convention, 
all private property, including property consisting of other humans, was sacrosanct. 
Without the security of property, they did not think any of their other rights were

secure. Th ey were willing to sacrifi ce their moral qualms about slavery to protect 
their rights to their own property. 
Th e fi rst time slavery intruded into the convention was when the delegates argued 
about representation in Congress. If representation was to be by population, then 
who would be counted as people ? Defenders of slavery wanted slaves to be counted in 
equal numbers with free citizens in assigning seats in the House of Representatives 
to states. Delegates from states where slavery was shrinking or gone wanted to count 
only free citizens. Pennsylvania’s James Wilson off ered a compromise resolution, 
quickly seconded by South Carolina’s Charles Pinckney (who owned more slaves 
than almost any other delegate), which said that representation in Congress would 
be apportioned: 
In proportion to the whole number of white and other free Citizens and 
inhabitants of every age sex and condition including those bound to servitude 
for a term of years and three-fi ft hs of all other persons not comprehended in 
the foregoing description, except Indians not paying taxes, in each state. 
Everyone knew that “all other persons” meant slaves. Aft er further debates, the fi nal 
document kept the three-fi ft hs clause . 
Some delegates objected. Pennsylvania’s Gouverneur Morris condemned the 
three-fi ft hs clause as creating a situation in which 
the inhabitant of Georgia and South Carolina who goes to the Coast of Africa, 
and in defiance of the most sacred laws of humanity tears away his fellow 
creatures from their dearest connection and damns them to the most cruel 
bondages, shall have more votes in a government instituted for the protection 
of the rights of mankind, than the citizen of Pennsylvania or New Jersey who 
views with laudable horror so nefarious a practice. 
But in the end, the “nefarious practice” won. 
Moreover, the three-fi ft hs clause was far from the only concession to slaveholders. 
When a committee was appointed to start draft ing a document, Charles Cotesworth 
Pinckney warned them, “If the Committee should fail to insert some security to the 
Southern states against an emancipation of slaves, and taxes on exports, I will be bound 
by duty to my state to vote against the report.” He need not have worried. Th e fi rst draft 
of the Constitution included a clause that said Congress could neither tax nor prohibit 
“the migration or importation of such persons as the several States shall think proper 
to admit.” “Such Persons” referred to slaves, and the insistence that Congress could not 
tax or prohibit their “migration or importation” meant that the new government could 
not use its power in interstate commerce to limit the slave trade. However, the wording 
of the fi nal draft did allow Congress to change the policy aft er 1808, and when that 
year arrived, Congress did end the slave trade and stop the importation of slaves from 
Africa. Nevertheless, between 1787 and 1808, over 200,000 Africans were forcibly taken 
from Africa and sold into slavery in the American South. In that one short 21-year 
period, half as many slaves were brought to the United States as the 400,000 Africans 
who had been brought to America over the previous 177 years between 1610 and 1787. 
Th e fi nal compromise about slavery came quickly. Th e draft of the Constitution 
prepared by the Committee of Detail had said that each state had an obligation to 
“deliver up” any person charged with a serious crime in another state. Delegates 
from South Carolina and Georgia asked the convention to add a clause that required 
“fugitive slaves and servants to be delivered up like criminals.” Delegates from 
Pennsylvania and Connecticut objected. However, when it came time to vote, the 
convention embraced the request without a single dissent. It was the end of August. 
Th e delegates were tired and anxious to end their work. And the issue of slavery 
was just not as important to northerners as it was to southerners. As a result, the 
final version of the Constitution contained a clause (Article IV, Section 2) that 
three-fifths clause 
Another compromise from the Constitutional 
Convention by which slaves—though the 
term was never used—would be counted 
as three-fifths of a person for purposes of 
establishing a state’s representation under 
the proportional representation plan. 
6.2 
6.1 

184 Part III A New Birth of Freedom—Creating the United States of America, 1754–1800 
required states to extradite criminals from one state to another and a separate clause 
that stated: 
No Person held to Service or Labour in one State, under the Laws thereof, 
escaping into another, shall, in Consequence of any Law or Regulation therein, 
be discharged from such Service or Labour, but shall be delivered up on Claim 
of the Party to whom such Service or Labour may be due. 
Once again, the word slavery did not appear, but the meaning of “Person held to 
Service or Labour” meant slaves. 
Th e fugitive slave clause gave slaveholders a new and powerful tool. As the 1800s 
wore on, it led to increasing strife because many northerners resented it, and southerners 
became angry at northern slowness in complying with one of the planks of the 
Constitution that united them. 
Th e delegates who met in Philadelphia in 1787 compromised on many issues— 
slavery most of all—but one area where they did not compromise, despite the pleas 
of several delegates, would bedevil them for some time. On September 10, only a 
week before their fi nal vote, George Mason of Virginia said he wished “the plan had 
been prefaced with a Bill of Rights,” a guarantee of freedom of speech, press, religion, 
trial by jury, and so on, that would “give great quiet to the people.” Mason had 
been the author of the Virginia Declaration of Rights, and he anticipated that the 
lack of a formal guarantee of rights in the fi nal document would create strong opposition. 
But not a single state delegation approved Mason’s proposal, though several 
states now had their own bills of rights. Some delegates argued that such guarantees 
were unnecessary, but more of them were hot, tired, and ready to be done with 
their work. It was too late to add something new, but the failure to include a Bill of 
Rights in the original document almost derailed the whole plan for a new federal 
government. 
Forty-one of the original 55 delegates gathered for the final vote. Edmund 
Randolph who had introduced the Virginia Plan to the convention would not 
sign the fi nal document. Th e Constitution gave far more power to the federal government 
than he ever imagined it would. George Mason worried about the lack 
of a Bill of Rights. Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts objected to the Constitution 
because, fi rst, the three-fi ft hs clause gave too much power to slaveholding states 
and, second, the power to raise armies was a dangerous step toward a military 
establishment. Th e remaining 38 were ready to sign the document that began with 
these words: 
We the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, 
establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, 
promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves 
and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United 
States of America. 
Many perhaps agreed with Benjamin Franklin, who said that there were “several parts 
of this Constitution which I do not at present approve,” but “the older I grow the more 
apt I am to doubt my own judgment and pay more respect to the judgment of others.” 
And, he added a realistic note, “I doubt too whether any other Convention we can 
obtain may be able to make a better Constitution.” 
Debating and Adopting the Constitution 
As mandated by the call to the Constitutional Convention, once the 38 delegates 
had signed the draft Constitution, it was sent to the Congress that was meeting 
in New York. Ten of the delegates from the Philadelphia convention were also 
members of that Congress, and they transported the document. The delegates 
meeting in Philadelphia had far exceeded their instructions to propose amendments 
to the Articles of Confederation, but those members of the Congress who had not

participated in draft ing the new document were in no mood for a fi ght. Th ey simply 
sent the proposed Constitution to the states for their consideration, even though 
they understood that it replaced rather than amended the Articles of Confederation 
and were aware that the Constitution itself stated the conditions for its national 
launch: ratifi cation by only 9 of the 13 states. However, the members of Congress did 
require that the battles about whether to adopt this radical new experiment in government 
would be fought on a state-by-state basis in conventions of specially elected 
delegates who would choose to ratify, or not ratify, the Constitution. Th is approach 
would increase the power of the voters in each state to decide instead of representatives 
in the political bodies of the legislatures. In the fall of 1787, the outcome was by 
no means clear. 
To ensure that the document they had worked so hard to create actually 
became the fundamental law of the United States, delegates from the 
Constitutional Convention quickly went to work. James Madison, one of the 
chief architects of the new Constitution, set out to persuade the state conventions 
to adopt it. In the fall of 1787, he, along with Alexander Hamilton and John 
Jay—three leaders who did not normally get along with one another—wrote 85 
newspaper articles to support the Constitution, later published as Th e Federalist 
Papers . In these articles, the three argued passionately that the new nation needed 
a strong national government and described the problems that they believed the 
Constitution addressed. 
Th e Constitution’s advocates, who called themselves Federalists , entered the state 
conventions with important advantages. Th ey had a specifi c document and specifi c 
arguments on how theirs was a clear plan for improving the government. Th e new 
Constitution addressed the fears of many who would vote for delegates to the conventions 
and sit in them. For those afraid of another Shays’s Rebellion, for those wanting 
a strong U.S. Army to protect them from Indians along the Allegheny frontier, and for 
those worried about the nation’s credit rating, the Constitution provided reassurances 
not found in the Articles of Confederation. 
In contrast, for those known as Antifederalists , people who worried that 
a strong national government would trample on the rights of sovereign states 
and the liberties of individual (white, male) citizens, the Constitution off ered little 
to calm their fears. The Constitution, which lacked a Bill of Rights and shifted 
significant powers from the states to the federal government, provoked attacks 
by many who had fought hardest against British authority in the Revolution. Like 
many Antifederalists, Virginia’s Richard Henry Lee feared that a new “consolidated 
government” had been created and would be dominated by a “coalition of 
monarchy men, military men, aristocrats, and drones.” Ratification would not 
be easy. 
Th e Pennsylvania legislature, which met upstairs in the same building as the one 
the Constitutional Convention had met in, ordered the election of delegates even 
before Congress offi cially sent the Constitution to the states. Although backcountry 
farmers in Pennsylvania resisted strong government in any form, the majority of delegates 
to the Pennsylvania convention wanted to ratify the document and, if possible, 
be the fi rst state to do so, possibly securing the seat of the national government in 
Pennsylvania. But while Pennsylvanians debated, a convention in Delaware unanimously 
adopted the Constitution aft er only 5 days of discussion, beating Pennsylvania 
as the fi rst state to ratify. Delegates to New Jersey’s convention who liked the idea that 
taxes on imports arriving through New York Harbor would now be paid to the federal 
government instead of to the state of New York also ratifi ed quickly. Th ey were 
joined by Georgia, which wanted immediate protection from Indian raids, and by 
Connecticut, which had a strong Federalist party. Decisions among other states got 
more diffi cult.

American Voices 
James Madison, The Federalist Papers, 1787, and Patrick Henry’s response, 1788 
James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and John Jay published 
their Federalist Papers as individual pieces in newspapers in the 
fall and winter of 1787–1788. Hamilton wrote 51 of them; Madison, 
29; Jay only five. Madison’s were among the most articulate arguments 
for a strong federal government, including his argument in 
Federalist No. 10 that a national government would reduce the danger 
of a political faction trampling on the liberties of others. These 
articles were later collected as a book, The Federalist Papers, and 
remain one of the most often cited descriptions of the meaning of 
the new Constitution. But not everyone was convinced by the arguments 
put forward by the Constitution’s defenders in the Federalist 
Papers and in the various state conventions. There was opposition 
to adopting the Constitution in almost every state. In Virginia, 
Patrick Henry, one of the Constitution’s staunchest opponents, gave 
a stirring speech against the proposed new form of government. 
Where Madison placed his faith in a strong federal government, 
Henry trusted state governments as more accountable to the people 
and therefore more likely to protect their liberty. 
James Madison, Federalist No. 10 , November 22, 1787 
Among the numerous advantages promised by a well constructed 
Union, none deserves to be more accurately developed than its 
tendency to break and control the violence of faction.… 
A zeal for different opinions concerning religion, concerning 
government, and many other points, as well of speculation 
as of practice; an attachment to different leaders ambitiously 
contending for pre-eminence and power; or to persons of other 
descriptions whose fortunes have been interesting to the human 
passions, have, in turn, divided mankind into parties, inflamed 
them with mutual animosity, and rendered them much more 
disposed to vex and oppress each other than to co-operate for 
their common good. So strong is this propensity of mankind to 
fall into mutual animosities, that where no substantial occasion 
presents itself, the most frivolous and fanciful distinctions have 
been sufficient to kindle their unfriendly passions.…But the most 
common and durable source of factions has been the various 
and unequal distribution of property. Those who hold and those 
who are without property have ever formed distinct interests in 
society. Those who are creditors, and those who are debtors, fall 
under a like discrimination. A landed interest, a manufacturing 
interest, a mercantile interest, a moneyed interest, with many 
lesser interests, grow up of necessity in civilized nations, and 
divide them into different classes.… 
A rage for paper money, for an abolition of debts, for an 
equal division of property, or for any other improper or wicked 
project, will be less apt to pervade the whole body of the Union 
than a particular member of it; in the same proportion as such a 
malady is more likely to taint a particular county or district, than 
an entire State. 
In the extent and proper structure of the Union, therefore, we 
behold a republican remedy for the diseases most incident to 
republican government. And according to the degree of pleasure 
and pride we feel in being republicans, ought to be our zeal in 
cherishing the spirit and supporting the character of Federalists. 
Patrick Henry, “Speech against the Federal 
Constitution,” June 5, 1788 
Patrick Henry, a firebrand during the Revolution, spoke to the 
Virginia Convention called in 1788 to consider ratifying the 
Constitution. Although Madison tried hard to persuade him to support 
the document, Henry was adamant in his opposition. 
Here is a resolution as radical as that which separated us from 
Great Britain.…The rights of conscience, trial by jury, liberty of 
the press, all your immunities and franchises, all pretensions to 
human rights and privileges are rendered insecure, if not lost, by 
this change, so loudly talked of by some, and inconsiderately by 
others. Is this tame relinquishment of rights worthy of freemen? 
Is it worthy of that manly fortitude that ought to characterize 
republicans?… 
Guard with jealous attention the public liberty. Suspect everyone 
who approaches that jewel. Unfortunately, nothing will preserve 
it but downright force. Whenever you give up that force, 
you are inevitably ruined.…We are come hither to preserve the 
poor commonwealth of Virginia, if it can be possibly done: something 
must be done to preserve your liberty and mine. 
The Confederation, this same despised government, merits, in 
my opinion, the highest encomium: it carried us through a long 
and dangerous war; it rendered us victorious in that conflict with 
a powerful nation; it has secured us a territory greater than any 
European monarch possesses; and shall a government which 
has been thus strong and vigorous, be accused of imbecility, and 
abandoned for want of energy?… 
I am not well versed in history, but I will submit to your recollection, 
whether liberty has been destroyed most often by the 
licentiousness of the people, or by the tyranny of rulers. I imagine, 
sir, you will find the balance on the side of tyranny.… 
Before you abandon the present system, I hope you will consider 
not only its defects, most maturely, but likewise those of 
that which you are to substitute for it. May you be fully apprized 
of the dangers of the latter, not by fatal experience, but by some 
abler advocate than I! 
Thinking Critically 
1. Documentary Analysis 
According to Madison, what led to the emergence of political 
factions? Why did he think a strong federal government 
would limit the impact of factions? 
2. Historical Interpretation 
Compare and contrast Madison’s and Henry’s views on the 
new Constitution. What do they tell you about how each man 
saw the challenges and dangers facing the new nation? 

Chapter 6 Creating a Nation 187 
In Massachusetts, the outcome was far from certain. Although reaction to the 
rebellion of western Massachusetts farmers had helped launch the Constitution, 
these farmers themselves sent delegates to Boston who did not trust “these 
lawyers, and men of learning, and moneyed men, that talk so finely, and gloss 
over matters so smoothly, to make us poor little people swallow down the pill,” 
as an Antifederalist delegate said. Two of the state’s most respected revolutionaries—
Governor John Hancock, whose name was at the top of the Declaration 
of Independence, and Sam Adams of Boston Tea Party fame—believed that 
the Constitution sought to solve problems that were not serious and that the 
states, not the national government, were best situated to protect individual 
liberty. In the end, the Massachusetts convention adopted the Constitution by a 
close vote of 187 to 168 but only on the condition, as Adams insisted, that it be 
immediately amended to further protect the people’s liberties and the rights of 
state governments. The Constitutional Convention’s failure to add a Bill of Rights 
to the Constitution was already creating problems. 
Th e next states to consider the document faced even more diffi culties. Th e ratifying 
convention in New Hampshire adjourned without taking action. In addition, 
just as they had refused to attend the Constitutional Convention, the Rhode 
Island legislature refused even to call a convention. (Th ey did, however, submit 
the question to town meetings in the state, and the voters rejected it, 2,708 to 237.) 
Maryland’s convention approved the document, but also called for 28 amendments 
to limit the power of the federal government. South Carolina approved the 
Constitution despite delegates’ fears about “the interests of the Northern states” 
and the federal government’s potential to limit that state’s “peculiar species of 
property” (slaves). Because of these fears, South Carolina’s convention voted for 
an amendment that would guarantee that states “retain every power not expressly 
relinquished by them.” 
Virginia, the largest state in the Union, was divided. Madison and Washington 
were strong advocates for the Constitution. But others were not enthusiastic. George 
Mason worried about the lack of a Bill of Rights. Patrick Henry, perhaps the most 
respected Virginian after Washington, adamantly opposed the Constitution. His 
loyalty was to the sovereign state of Virginia. He was willing to be part of a loose federation 
of states, but only one that ensured that real authority rested with a government 
Madison said he wanted a strong national government 
because, while a political faction might capture a particular 
state, there was far less chance of such a group capturing 
the national government. Thus, he saw a strong national government 
as the best means of protecting liberty. In opposing adoption 
of the Constitution, Patrick Henry had the opposite fear, that 
a strong national government would not only be distant from 
the people, but would lead inevitably to a loss of “the rights of 
conscience, trial by jury, liberty of the press, all your immunities 
and franchises,” which were best protected by state and local 
governments. 
Thinking Critically 
1. Contextualization 
Looking back over the story of the American Revolution and 
this chapter what sorts of liberties do you think Madison and 
Henry were worried about? Whose liberty was more—or 
less—important to them? 
2. Crafting an Argument 
How did the proposed Constitution—without the Bill of 
Rights—protect or threaten liberties? Two hundred years 
later, whose fears do you think were more justified, Madison’s 
or Henry’s? Why?

close enough to its citizens to ensure their rights. In the end, Virginia ratified the 
Constitution in June 1788, partly because its opponents were split among themselves. 
Virginia’s convention also demanded a Bill of Rights as soon as possible. With the 
vote in Virginia and a positive vote in a reconvened convention in New Hampshire 
earlier that same month, the Constitution was ratifi ed, having reached its quota of 
nine states to support it. 
Although enough states had supported ratifi cation to launch the Constitution, no 
national government could thrive without New York. New York was already emerging 
as the fi nancial center of the new nation, and the state sat in a strategic location between 
New England and the rest of the country. Th e New York convention debate was long 
and bitter. Alexander Hamilton led the charge for the Constitution, but Antifederalists 
were strong in New York. Given what was happening in other states, it would have 
been hard for New York to reject the Constitution, especially when many New Yorkers 
still hoped that the federal capital would remain in New York City. In the summer of 
1788, the New York convention considered 55 possible amendments, a call for a second 
convention to revise the Constitution aft er its adoption, and a conditional vote that 
would ratify the document only if it were amended. In the end, however, by a slim margin 
(30–27), New York ratifi ed the Constitution in July 1788, the 11th state to do so.

As it became clear that the Constitution would be ratifi ed and that the country would have a new and 
stronger government, crowds celebrated. In spite of the strong opposition to the Constitution, once it 
became law, most Americans supported it, though many also insisted that a Bill of Rights be added as 
quickly as possible.

Chapter 6 Creating a Nation 189 
The last states to ratify the Constitution, North Carolina and Rhode Island, 
made their choice only aft er the new government was already functioning. By the 
time they acted, there was no practical way for any state to remain outside of the 
new United States or its government. Refusing to ratify would have made a state 
a foreign government amid the formal United States. It remained for Americans 
to translate the document into an actual government and work out their complex 
relationships across divisions of class, race, gender, and degrees of freedom 
and unfreedom as well as the extraordinary distances in geography and belief that 
separated them. 
6.2 Quick Review What failures of the Articles of Confederation did the Constitution address? 
CONCLUSION 
With the end of the Revolution and the recognition of American independence, the 
government of the new United States now faced the same problem that had faced 
the British royal government in the past: how to pay for a war and how to govern 
a restive populace enjoying both the benefi ts and disappointments of their liberty. 
Offi cers in the Continental Army threatened to rebel when payment for their services 
was not forthcoming. Poor farmers, some of whom had served in the army during 
the Revolution and had never been paid, suff ered because of an infl ux of expensive 
imported goods that came with the war’s end created an economic depression. Many 
began petitioning state legislatures for relief and resorted to rebellion when that 
approach failed. From New York and Pennsylvania to the Carolinas and Georgia, 
various Native American tribes challenged the new United States as white settlers 
streamed over the Allegheny Mountains into territory that the British government 
had kept off limits before the Revolution. At the same time, Congress began to 
resolve state’s claims to lands far into the interior, creating new states and territories 
for white settlers. 
The issues of freedom and liberty that had rallied a new nation also took hold 
with slaves, and they and some white allies increasingly began to call for changes. 
Northern states, where slavery was less essential to the economy, slowly began to 
phase out slavery, but southern states, whose economic base depended on slave labor, 
were adamantly against emancipation and imported record numbers of new slaves. 
In addition, women in all levels of society began to expect more equal treatment 
and broader opportunities, particularly the right to education. Women’s expectations 
were translated in the male-dominated society to an ideology of Republican 
Motherhood in which women were expected to be better educated than their mothers 
and grandmothers but only so they could support the political development of their 
husbands and sons. 
Many believed that at the core of many of the new nation’s problems was 
the fact that the governing document for the United States, the Articles of 
Confederation, was too weak a foundation on which to base a central government, 
in part, because it lacked the means to support itself through any kind of taxation. 
Th e Constitutional Convention that met over the summer of 1787 had been tasked 
by Congress to revise the Articles of Confederation. Instead, the representatives 
debated and designed a completely new Constitution, a very diff erent document 
laying out a new form of government with three branches of government: an executive 
branch, including the president and cabinet; a legislative branch, consisting of 
two houses of Congress; and a judicial branch, including a Supreme Court. A key 
purpose of this design was to balance power, preventing one person or group from 
dominating the government while at the same time giving the national government 
the authority to act. 
6.2 
6.1 

190 Part III A New Birth of Freedom—Creating the United States of America, 1754–1800 
In many ways, the U.S. Constitution reflected the needs and aspirations of its 
creators—white men who were the elite of their society. Although the Constitution’s 
language never used the terms slave or slavery, the ideas and points within it upheld 
the institution, a benefi t to many of the Constitution’s creators. 
When the Constitution was presented to Congress for approval, Congress 
mandated that each state should call a special convention of delegates specifically 
elected to ratify, or not ratify, the document. As laid out in the body of the 
Constitution itself, a total of nine states would be needed to launch this new 
form of government. Th roughout the states, debate was heated. Federalists and 
Antifederalists (supporters and opponents of the Constitution) took strong and 
contentious stands. Eventually, all states ratifi ed the document, some by very narrow 
margins. No state wanted to be left behind on its own. However, no state found 
the document to be completely acceptable, and demands were strong to amend it 
immediately, particularly, by adding a Bill of Rights to protect all citizens. But by 
1788, even before those changes were enacted and even before the last two states 
had ratifi ed the Constitution, a new form of government for the United States was 
ready to be launched.

Explain how the outcome of the American Revolution affected 
different groups in the new United States. 
Summary 
For people of all classes, races, and political persuasions in 
British North America, the Revolution brought extensive, 
though not total, change. Great inequality remained, but few 
people were as willing to defend it as they had in the colonial 
era. Nonetheless, the American victory meant diff erent things 
to diff erent people, and national unity was fragile in the years 
immediately following the war. Congress’s delay in providing 
pay and pensions for veterans came close to sparking a military 
coup. Farmers in western Massachusetts were driven to rebellion 
by high taxes and hard economic times. The new states 
moved quickly to settle lands to the west of their established 
boundaries, sparking new confl icts and tensions with Indian 
peoples. Free blacks sought to create strong communities as 
slavery greatly declined in the northern states, but slavery 
became even more entrenched in the southern states. Women 
throughout the states began to question their roles in this newly 
independent nation, and many supported the idea that education 
for women would strengthen their contributions. Others 
were wary of elevating women’s status and limited those trends 
through the ideology of Republican Motherhood, which shaped 
the lives of women in complex ways.

Summary 
In the years aft er the Revolution, many leading citizens came 
to believe that the Articles of Confederation were insufficient 
to meet the economic and political challenges facing the 
new nation. Th e delegates who gathered at the Constitutional 
Convention of 1787 represented the white male elite. Key issues 
at the convention included the structure of the national legislature, 
slavery, and the powers of the executive branch. Aft er considerable 
debate, the delegates arrived at a new framework for 
the national government, which went far beyond the task they 
had been asked to do—revise the Articles of the Confederation. 
When the Constitution was presented to the members of the 
Congress that was in session, they fi rst debated whether to censure 
those who produced the unrequested document, but ultimately 
decided to ask each state to convene a special convention 
of specially elected delegates to decide whether or not to ratify 
the Constitution. Th e battle over ratifi cation pitted Federalists 
against Antifederalists. Th e Federalist promise to move quickly 
to create a Bill of Rights for the Constitution helped secure 
ratifi cation.

7 Practicing Democracy 
When New Hampshire and Virginia voted to ratify the Constitution 
in June 1788, it became the law of the land. But putting that new 
law into effect was not easy. The old Congress as well as local 
and state offi cials in the 13 states needed to conduct elections. Th ose elected 
to the new positions, as members of the U.S. House of Representatives 
and Senate and as the new president, would breathe life into the words of 
the Constitution and set precedents based on their interpretation of its 
meaning—or their preferences—that would last for generations. Diff erent 
Americans, however, interpreted the Constitution diff erently. Americans 
discovered that they wanted the country to develop in diverse ways and 
began long-term arguments with one another about policy. 
Soon after the new Congress was elected, it created and enacted the 
Bill of Rights, 10 amendments that many thought should have been part 
of the original document. With this addition, more Americans felt comfortable 
that they had created a government that would protect their rights 
and maintain their freedom. Once elected as president, George Washington 
quickly set out to define this important American role. He appointed 
the first members of the Supreme Court and other judges and created a 
presidential cabinet to carry out the work of his administration. One cabinet 
member, Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton, laid the foundation 
for the nation’s economic system. Washington himself asserted federal 
authority and expanded the U.S. Army to win Indian Wars on the nation’s 
frontier. Washington’s vice president, John Adams, and his secretary of 
state, Th omas Jeff erson, who would later become the next two presidents, 
worked together in this early government, but eventually became bitter 
rivals whose arguments represented different directions for the country.

Analyze the first federal elections and the adoption of the Bill of Rights. 
In one of its last acts under the Articles of Confederation, the outgoing Congress set 
the dates for elections for the House of Representatives, the Senate, and presidential 
electors to occur in early 1789. Th e Constitution left it to each state legislature 
to decide how to manage these elections. No one had conducted elections like these 
before, and it took time to work out the process. 
Elections for members of the House were held in January and February of 1789. As 
permitted in the Constitution, diff erent states had diff erent rules for who could vote. 
Some House races were hotly contested, including the one in Virginia’s fi ft h district 
that pitted two future U.S. presidents, James Madison and James Monroe, against each 
other. Madison won and played a crucial role in the fi rst Congress. State legislatures 
then elected the members of the U.S. Senate, as they would do until 1913. Presidential 
electors were chosen by diff erent methods depending on the state, and they cast their 
ballots for the fi rst president. 
Congress and President Washington: Setting to Work 
By early spring, the new Congress began to assemble in the nation’s temporary 
capital, New York City (the location that many of its residents hoped would become 
permanent). Congress was supposed to convene on March 4, but it was not until 
April that either house of Congress could muster a quorum—a majority of the total 
members, which was required to do business. Much business awaited. Th e Constitution 
required each house to set up its own rules of operation. Th e Senate had to confi rm the 
election of the president. Th e Constitution also gave the new government the power 
to set and collect taxes. The need for a tax law was urgent: each day that Congress 
delayed, thousands of dollars went uncollected. 
On April 14, Charles Th omson, the secretary of Congress, arrived at Mount 
Vernon to offi cially inform George Washington of what he already knew: he had 
been unanimously elected president of the United States by the 69 presidential 
electors who also elected John Adams as vice president though by a smaller vote. 
Washington quickly traveled to New York where he and Adams were formally 
inaugurated on April 30, 1789. He then set to work creating the executive branch of 
the federal government. 
The 58-year-old George Washington had no precedents to guide him. An 
independent republic with an elected citizen at its head was an unprecedented 
development for the world of 1789. Some, led by Alexander Hamilton who loved 
British models, recommended that Washington establish a court similar to that of 
King George III. Others, including Vice President John Adams, recommended a 
more egalitarian approach. Washington steered a middle course, insisting on formal 
state dinners and fairly formal relationships with those who came to call on him, but 
avoiding a throne or robes of offi ce. He was called simply “Mr. President” instead 
of “your Highness.” Although he was the only president never to live in the White 
House, he did help to design it, although African slaves did most of the work building 
it. While in offi ce, he maintained a formal presidential residence in New York City 
and in Philadelphia when the capital moved there in 1790.

The Bill of Rights 
On May 4, 1789, only a month aft er the House of Representatives had begun its work, 
James Madison told the House that he would soon fulfill his promise and propose 
amendments to the Constitution. On June 8, he off ered amendments that included 
line-by-line changes in the Constitution. Proposing amendments was easy. Getting 
them passed was not. Some of Madison’s strongest partners in getting the Constitution 
adopted were neutral or hostile to amending it. President Washington, at Madison’s 
request, made a brief reference to amendments in his inaugural address. Later, 
Washington said of the proposed amendments “Some of them, in my opinion, are 
importantly necessary, others, though of themselves (in my conception) not very essential, 
are necessary to quiet the fears of some respectable characters and well-meaning 
men.” It was hardly a ringing endorsement. On the other hand, some Federalists in 
Congress thought it was far too early to amend the Constitution, especially when other 
issues, like balancing the budget, were pressing. 
During the ratification process, however, Madison had promised to add a 
Bill of Rights to the Constitution, guaranteeing citizens important rights under 
a federal government. Without a promise for those added rights, key states would 
not have ratifi ed the Constitution. While he was determined to fulfi ll his promise, 
Madison also knew that Antifederalists sought more far-reaching changes, and he 
wanted to act faster than those opponents. Representative Th eodorick Bland, a close 
ally of Patrick Henry, proposed a second convention to consider “the defects of this 
Constitution.” If Congress did not act to quiet this movement, the whole constitutional 
structure could unravel. 
Madison quickly abandoned his original proposal for new clauses to be 
included throughout the body of the Constitution and decided instead to propose 
amendments to be added at the end of the document. Th e House initially passed 
17 amendments, but the Senate changed them, and on September 25, Congress 
sent 12 amendments to the states for ratifi cation. It was fast work for a body that 
had not existed 6 months earlier. An amendment setting the size of the House was 
not ratifi ed; neither was an amendment limiting Congressional pay (it was ratifi ed 
fi nally in 1992). Th e other 10 amendments became the Bill of Rights, added to the 
Constitution in 1791 aft er three-fourths of the state legislatures approved them. Th e 
fi rst of these amendments said: 
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment 
of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or 
abridging the freedom of speech, or the press, or the right 
of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the 
Government for a redress of grievances. 
Other of the amendments included “the right of the people to 
keep and bear Arms,” freedom from being required to house soldiers 
in private homes (a major grievance against the British before 
the Revolution), the right to be “secure in their persons, houses, 
papers, and eff ects, against unreasonable searches and seizures,” 
the right to trial by jury, the right to a speedy trial, and limits on 
excessive bail. 
Finally, the Tenth Amendment—perhaps most important to 
many Antifederalists, especially those who worried about federal 
intervention in the institution of slavery—limited the powers of 
the national government: 
The powers not delegated to the United States by the 
Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved 
to the States respectively, or to the people.

Quick Review Why was the Bill of Rights added to the Constitution? 
CREATING AN ECONOMY: ALEXANDER HAMILTON AND THE U.S. 
ECONOMIC SYSTEM 
Analyze the enduring argument begun by Hamilton’s economic vision for the United States 
and the alternative vision of Jefferson and Madison. 
President Washington faced diffi cult problems, many of them economic. Th e inability 
of the federal government under the Articles of Confederation to collect taxes meant 
that federal debts were not being paid and that the financial status of the United 
States was in serious trouble. The government could not afford an army sufficient 
to protect the frontier. Tensions with Britain were made worse because Britain had 
not withdrawn its troops from western forts as promised in the Treaty of Paris and 
because London merchants who were owed large sums from Americans were angry. 
Although the Continental Congress had adopted the dollar as the national currency in 
1785, there was no offi cial currency; Congress, state governments, and private banks 
had printed a variety of paper notes, all of which could be easily counterfeited, and 
the ease with which they were put into circulation led to infl ation. In the new United 
States, as during much of the colonial era, people bought and sold with an amazing 
variety of paper notes and coins from around the world, especially Spanish gold 
and silver. Solving the fi nancial crisis and regulating the currency was essential for 
national prosperity. 
In the summer of 1789, Congress adopted a fi ve percent customs tax on all imports 
into the United States, creating a solid fi nancial footing for the new government. It also 
set up a system of federal courts and approved the establishment of four senior positions 
within the executive branch: secretaries of state, war, and the treasury, and an 
attorney general. Th ese four offi cials became the fi rst presidential cabinet. 
Washington quickly appointed Th omas Jeff erson, then U.S. Ambassador to Paris, 
as his secretary of state; General Henry Knox, his deputy in command throughout 
the Revolution, as secretary of war; and his friend, the former governor of Virginia, 
Edmund Randolph, as attorney general. But given the nation’s fi nancial problems, the 
most important and powerful position would be secretary of the treasury, and to that 
offi ce, Washington appointed New Yorker Alexander Hamilton. A brilliant and ruthless 
political infi ghter, Hamilton could handle the economic crisis better than anyone else, 
even if Washington also knew from bitter experience that he could never completely 
trust Hamilton, who had served as Washington’s chief aide during the Revolution and 
had sometimes gone behind his commander’s back or quarreled directly with him. 
The Secretary of the Treasury’s Key Role 
On his fi rst full day on the job, Secretary Hamilton negotiated a $50,000 loan from 
the Bank of New York to keep the new government solvent. He also set about creating 
a Customs Service to collect the fi ve percent import tax that Congress had already 
passed, and he organized what would become the U.S. Coast Guard to be sure that 
imports were not smuggled into the country without being taxed. Hamilton had once 
said, “I hate procrastination in business,” and he was not about to make a slow start on 
the new job. Ten days aft er his appointment, the House of Representatives asked him 
for a report on the public credit of the United States—the most pressing national issue 
in virtually everyone’s view—and gave him until January to prepare it.

Debt and Taxes 
Hamilton’s Report Relative to a Provision for the Support of Public Credit was the 
foundation of the economic development of the new nation. Hamilton had read widely 
in philosophy and economics, as if preparing for the moment when he would be asked 
to design a new economic system. As he looked at the crushing debt that the nation 
faced from the Revolution—$54 million in federal debt and $25 million more in state 
debts—he knew that radical action was required. Few people, including foreign and 
domestic investors and foreign governments, trusted the new country’s ability to pay 
its bills. As a result, neither the state and federal governments nor private businesses 
could borrow money. Th e government could not fi nance desperately needed activities, 
including the creation of an army. Private businesses could not restart commerce, 
which had been mostly frozen since the Revolution. Revolutionary War veterans who 
had been paid in government promissory notes had sold them for as little as 15 cents 
on the dollar rather than trust a government that seemed untrustworthy to pay what it 
had promised. In this crisis, Hamilton saw only one solution. Th e federal government, 
he believed, needed to assume all of the Revolutionary War debt—state and federal— 
and promise to pay it all off , dollar for dollar, while establishing a tax policy that would 
show wary observers that the government would meet its obligations. “Credit is the 
entire thing,” Hamilton argued. 
Not everyone in Congress agreed. To Hamilton’s surprise, his close ally in the fi ght 
over adopting the Constitution, James Madison, led the opposition to debt assumption 
in the House, and more quietly, Secretary of State Jeff erson led similar opposition 
within the administration. States like Virginia and North Carolina that had paid off 
most of their own war debts were unhappy with the idea that they would pay taxes 
to cover the debts of what they considered less responsible states like Massachusetts 
and South Carolina. Veterans who had sold their government promissory notes at 
highly depreciated rates during the 1780s to eat and live were appalled that the civilian 
speculators to whom they had sold them would get rich on the 100 percent payment 
of the debt. And for those who shared Jeff erson’s view of a democratic nation of small 
farmers, Hamilton’s plan created a national government that was too big, would raise 
too much in taxes, sustain a standing army, and shift power from farmers to urban 
and commercial interests. Th ey would have none of it. 
In the spring of 1790, the House, led by Madison, rejected Hamilton’s proposals 
each of four times he submitted it. Ever the wily politician, Hamilton sought a compromise 
and Secretary of State Jeff erson made it happen. Many years later, Jeff erson 
told the story of how he hosted a dinner at his home in New York at which he, 
Madison, and Hamilton struck a deal by which each one got something that he 
considered important. Hamilton wanted New York City, his home and the nation’s 
commercial center, to be the permanent U.S. capital. But others—especially Jeff erson 
and Madison—wanted to locate the capital further south. Th ey disliked the diffi cult 
travel to New York, and they also disliked urban life. They feared that a northern 
capital would fuel northern antislavery tendencies in Congress. Not incidentally, 
Madison, like George Washington, owned land on the Potomac River that would 
become more valuable if the capital were nearby. If Hamilton would agree to support 
Jeff erson and Madison on the location of the capital, then the two Virginians would 
support Hamilton’s economic plan. 
In July, Congress made the compromise official. Philadelphia, not New York, 
was designated as the new temporary capital and the law also stipulated that a 
10-square-mile site on the Potomac River between Maryland and Virginia should 
become the nation’s permanent capital. They gave President Washington a free 
hand to select the specific site and plan the new center of government. Congress 
also passed Hamilton’s fi nancial plan, including the assumption of state debts by the 
federal government. Henceforth, the new nation would have a government on a solid 
fi nancial footing with a guaranteed credit rating, just as Hamilton wanted. 
This painting of Alexander Hamilton (ca. 1804) was 
done by the artist John Trumbull after Hamilton 
had left offi ce. Hamilton’s fi scal program was 
controversial from the beginning but it launched 
the nation’s economy in a commercial directon 
and also created political division that continued 
for decades in the United States.

Chapter 7 Practicing Democracy 197 
Th e compromise solved the immediate issues, but the split on economic policy 
would lead to the creation of two hostile political parties—which came to be known as 
the Federalists and the Democratic-Republicans (known at fi rst as Antifederalists)— 
that would dominate the nation’s politics for the next decade. In the fi rst years of the 
new government, those who supported the Constitution called themselves Federalists 
(wanting a strong federal government), and those opposed to the adoption of the 
Constitution and then Hamilton’s interpretation of it were happy to be known simply 
as Antifederalists. But as the battle over Hamilton’s plans intensified, those in the 
government and the newspapers who supported Madison’s and Jeff erson’s opposition 
began to call themselves Democratic-Republicans, claiming that they, not those 
following Hamilton, were the true defenders of the republic. Most everyone, including 
Hamilton, Jeff erson, Madison, and especially Washington, abhorred the idea of opposing 
political parties, but such parties were beginning to form before Washington fi nished 
his fi rst term in offi ce, though no one yet called them that. 
To a degree, the political divisions refl ected a sectional split. Supporting Hamilton 
were bankers in New York and Philadelphia as well as merchants, especially those 
engaged in seagoing trade based in Boston or other ports. Th ose tending to support 
the Democratic-Republican cause included southern plantation owners, who always 
worried that the new government would move against slavery and who saw little value 
in banks and commercial development; farmers, ranging from supporters of Daniel 
Shays in Massachusetts to farmers in the backwoods of Kentucky; and small-town 
merchants who were less dependent on international credit. Supporters of each side 
also had their own newspaper. John Fenno had launched the Gazette of the United 
States in 1789 to support the Federalist cause. Two years later, Madison and Jeff erson 
convinced Philip Freneau to launch the staunchly Antifederalist National Gazette. 
To support that paper, Jeff erson, to his later embarrassment, also put Freneau on the 
federal payroll as an offi cial of the State Department. Th e lines between two groups 
were growing stronger. 
The First Bank of the United States 
Once he had resolved the debt issue, Hamilton’s next move widened the divide between 
those who, like him, wanted an activist government and a robust commercial economy 
and those who preferred Jefferson’s vision of an agrarian nation made up of small 
independent farmers with a very modest national government. In December 1790, 
Hamilton submitted another report to Congress that called for creating a Bank of 
the United States , modeled on the Bank of England. Hamilton’s fondness for British 
models was one reason many Americans never trusted him. But Hamilton did not want 
to be part of Britain. He wanted to use Britain’s economic model to build a nation that 
would become as powerful as Britain. Achieving that vision meant creating a federal 
bank that would manage the economy and fund a strong government, as Britain’s bank 
did for that country. As with the debt, not everyone agreed. 
Th e Bank of England was a joint public-private venture. Most of its shareholders were 
private investors, but it played a key role in guaranteeing and repaying Britain’s public 
debt, and its paper bank notes were accepted as offi cial currency in Britain. Hamilton 
did not trust Congress or the states to issue paper currency. He feared—all too realistically, 
given what had happened during the Revolution—that Congress and the states 
would solve fi nancial problems by printing more currency and, thus, quickly debase its 
value and re-create the infl ation that the nation faced in the 1790s. But Hamilton was 
confi dent that no investors would risk their funds by allowing more currency to circulate 
than they could aff ord to redeem. He was anxious to have those Americans who 
had funds to invest become strongly attached to the new government. Currency from 
a semiprivate bank could be trusted because the bank would have to redeem its paper 
currency in gold or silver. Hamilton believed the United States could have a stable currency 
that everyone trusted if the Bank of the United States were chartered.

issued currency for the country and stabilized 
the economy.

A central bank could also make loans, thus expanding the amount of credit 
available. With resources backed by both private investors and government 
guarantees, the bank could ease the credit squeeze and stimulate commerce and 
trade. Businesses could get loans. Investment in new enterprises could begin. 
Much of the bank’s financing would also be promissory notes from the government 
itself—notes that Hamilton had just guaranteed would maintain their 
full value. 
For southern plantation owners like Jefferson and Madison, the bank plan was 
much worse than the plan to assume all debt for the Revolutionary War. The bank 
plan would centralize power in the big northern cities—Philadelphia, New York, 
and Boston—where the nation’s largest banks were. Jefferson did not like cities. 
He preferred small rural communities, which he believed were far more democratic 
places. He said, “I think our governments will remain virtuous for many 
centuries as long as they are chiefly agricultural.” And, he continued, when people 
“get piled upon one another in large cities, as in Europe, they will become corrupt 
as in Europe.” In addition, Jefferson, like most Democratic-Republicans of 
his day, did not like banks. The battle over the Bank of the United States was a 
key battle in a war between those who wanted an urban commercial nation and 
those who wanted a nation based on independent farmers. It would not be the last 
such battle. 
Jefferson feared that banks would keep the poor in poverty and enrich those 
who were already wealthy through ill-gotten gains based on speculation rather than 
hard work. For most farmers, who were always in debt given their need to buy seed 
and fertilizer before they could plant and harvest a crop, banks were the distant 
institutions that hounded them to repay loans. For Jeff erson and Madison, and even 
for John Adams, the thought that the government they had worked so hard to create 
was now about to create a bank was galling. Although Hamilton and Madison had 
both helped write and defend the Constitution, they now parted company forever 
over their interpretation of it. 
The 1799 building that was designed for the First Bank of the United States in Philadelphia refl ected the 
solid structure and grand hopes that Hamilton had for his bank.

Chapter 7 Practicing Democracy 199 
Despite the opposition of some of the nation’s most eloquent leaders, the bank 
bill sailed through Congress. Almost all northern representatives voted for it, and 
almost all southern ones against it. The sectional lines, and the lines between the 
Federalist and Democratic-Republican factions (they were not yet political parties) 
were clearly emerging. 
Once the bill passed both houses of Congress, Washington had to decide 
whether to sign it. For Madison, who had been operating as Washington’s key 
spokesperson in Congress, the bank was an unconstitutional extension of federal 
power, and he argued privately and persuasively that Washington should veto the 
bill. Washington then turned to his cabinet for advice. Attorney General Randolph 
and Secretary of State Jeff erson both urged a veto. Th e Tenth Amendment was clear, 
they said, that anything not mentioned in the Constitution was left to the states, 
and the Constitution certainly did not authorize a federal bank. For Secretary of 
the Treasury Hamilton, however, the bank was essential, and the Constitution, 
he said, gave Congress the authority to do everything “necessary and proper” for 
the smooth functioning of the nation. He warned Washington that if the national 
government did not invoke the “necessary and proper clause,” then Americans 
would become “a people governed without government .” Washington signed the 
bill in February 1791, and the United States now had a bank and deeper political 
divisions than previously imagined. 
Aft er the bank bill, Hamilton proposed a federal mint to create uniform coins for 
use throughout the country. For almost 20 years aft er the Revolution, people had used 
foreign coins. Hamilton wanted U.S. coins based on the U.S. dollar, not the British 
pound. It was not a controversial proposal, and the federal mint was soon established. 
With the mint in place, Hamilton resigned as Secretary of the Treasury in 1795, and 
Washington appointed Oliver Wolcott in his place. Though he remained a close 
presidential advisor until the end of Washington’s term, Hamilton preferred to make 
money as a private citizen. 
Hamilton’s Commercial Nation vs. Jeff erson’s Agrarian Vision 
Hamilton’s last major report to Congress was his Report on Manufactures . Unlike 
the earlier reports, this one was not a plea for immediate legislation, but rather a 
blueprint for the future of the nation as Hamilton saw it. Where Jeff erson wanted 
an agrarian nation that exported raw materials, Hamilton wanted a more complete 
economy within the United States. He, too, saw farming as the backbone of the 
economy, but he also wanted to support factories that would create fi nished goods 
from the products of the fi elds, forests, and mines for both domestic consumption 
and export. In addition, he wanted the nation to make everything its military might 
need, from uniforms to gunpowder and warships. 
Hamilton was a harsh critic of slavery, but although he did not mention slavery 
in his Report on Manufactures, the document was suffused with what 70 years 
later a new Republican Party would call “free labor.” Hamilton’s vision promoted 
open immigration. Immigrants from Europe would work in the emerging 
factories, Hamilton said, and a plentiful supply of new workers would keep wages 
low and factories profitable for their owners. He had no fear of child labor 
either, noting, “in general, women and children are rendered more useful, and 
the latter more early useful, by manufacturing establishments than they would 
otherwise be.” 
Hamilton wanted a federal government that would shape the nation’s economy 
rather than leave economic development to individuals. He believed that higher tariff s 
should protect new industries and that government incentives should help launch 
those ventures when private investment was not sufficient. He saw strong patent 
protection as essential to invention. Moreover, he wanted to build a network of roads 
and canals to help commerce fl ow.

200 Part III A New Birth of Freedom—Creating the United States of America, 1754–1800 
These ideas frightened Jefferson and Madison. At one point, Jefferson told 
Washington that he thought his treasury secretary was expanding the “general welfare” 
clause of the Constitution to give Congress the authority to regulate every aspect of 
the nation’s economy. Jeff erson would continue to worry, especially as Washington 
sided with his treasury secretary more oft en than not. 
Although Hamilton was a brilliant if sometimes unscrupulous leader, not all of his 
ideas were his alone. He was regularly looking to Europe, especially Britain, for ideas, 
and there were many economic ideas ready for export. Hamilton greatly admired the 
British industrialists who were creating mechanized production on a scale never seen 
before. He was also infl uenced by the Scottish philosopher Adam Smith whose book, 
Wealth of Nations, was published in 1776. 
In the economic world that Smith described, wealth was generated, not by the 
simple ownership of things—land or gold or products—but, rather, by the free trade of 
goods and services and by competition to expand trade. As people competed to make 
a profi t on their transactions, they increased the circulation of money, lowered the cost 
of goods, and created general prosperity—the wealth of nations and of individuals. 
Competition, Smith said, was the key to wealth. Th us he wrote, “It is not from the 
benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but 
from their regard to their self-interest.” As that self-interest is satisfi ed through competition, 
there is more meat, beer, and bread at lower cost available for everyone while 
the butcher, brewer, and baker live well. For Smith, who called Britain “a nation of 
shopkeepers,” it was the shopkeepers and manufacturers and traders, not the hoarders 
of gold and silver, who made wealth.

7.2 
I n his 1791 Report on Manufactures , Alexander Hamilton 
defended “the expediency of encouraging manufacturers in the 
United States.” Contrasting farming with manufacturing, he noted: 
labour employed in Agriculture is in a great measure 
periodical and occasional, depending on seasons, 
liable to various and long intermissions; while that 
occupied in many manufactures is constant and 
regular, extending through the year, embracing in 
some instances night as well as day. 
Hamilton knew that not everyone agreed with him. Some 
believed that it was wrong to use the government “to accelerate 
the growth of manufactures.” Critics, he knew, liked a world 
in which, “the less independent condition of an artisan can be 
exchanged for the more independent condition of a farmer.” 
Hamilton’s critics, led by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, 
feared an activist government and thought his plans were an antidemocratic 
effort to strengthen the power of the financial elite 
and their political allies. Where Hamilton wanted the federal government 
to foster manufacturing and commerce, Jefferson and 
his supporters wanted a passive federal government that stayed 
out of people’s way. While still secretary of state, Jefferson wrote, 
“Hamilton’s financial system…had two objects; 1st, as a puzzle to 
exclude popular understanding and inquiry, 2nd, as a machine for 
the corruption of the legislature.” Jefferson believed that independent 
farmers were far more likely to maintain a strong democratic 
government than paid employees, who, in giving up their economic 
freedom, would soon also give up their political freedom. 
He saw Hamilton’s plan as a way to confuse the true agents of 
democracy. This debate from the 1790s is still alive today.

Smith’s book was a direct attack on the earlier ideas of mercantilism that saw 
wealth as a matter of getting and hoarding wealth. In the new world of a capitalist 
system or a market economy where commerce and trade were most significant, 
Great Britain, with its growing factories and its Royal Navy controlling the oceans, 
was destined to great wealth. As Smith was trying to describe the economic system in 
Great Britain, Hamilton was trying with surprising success, in spite of the opposition, 
to duplicate the system in the United States. 
7.2 
Quick Review How did Hamilton’s ideas for the young United States differ from those of 
Jefferson? How might different groups of Americans line up as supporters of one or the other? 
SETTING THE PACE: THE WASHINGTON ADMINISTRATION 
Explain the precedents set by George Washington’s presidential administration. 
While President Washington tended to leave economic policy to his secretary of the 
treasury, he was far from a passive bystander during his 8 years in offi ce. Although 
economic issues were the top priority, Washington also faced many others. Having 
spent most of his adult life in public service, Washington knew how fragile the new 
republic was. Th e votes to adopt the new Constitution had been close in several states, 
and powerful leaders, including Patrick Henry in Virginia and John Hancock in 
Massachusetts, would have been happy to return to a system in which the states were 
supreme and the national government only a weak federation. Many rural Americans, 
including the poor white farmers who made up most of the citizens, distrusted all 
governments and felt they got little benefi t from them while the tax on imports raised 
the cost of necessities. An obscure Massachusetts farmer, William Manning, who had 
fought at the battle of Concord, now wrote a pamphlet, Th e Key of Liberty, in which 
he argued that “friends to liberty and free government” needed to be watchful of the 
“few” who were dominating the new administration and needed to be prevented from 
destroying “free government” and “tyrannizing over” the people. While farmers like 
Manning complained, Britain was alert, maneuvering in military and diplomatic 
actions along the borders of the fl edgling republic, prepared to reopen hostilities and, 
indeed, retake the newly independent nation. 
Washington was especially worried that the new nation would lose the land west 
of the 13 original states. Although Britain had ceded all its claims to land east of the 
Mississippi River to the United States, Indians who lived in that huge territory had not 
agreed, and when Washington took offi ce, the tribes were considerably stronger than 
the U.S. Army. In addition, the British had not removed all of their forces from forts 
in that area, even though they had agreed to at the end of the Revolution. Th e British 
saw the Indians as a useful instrument to help them reignite a war that would end 
American independence and return the country to the empire. 
Many western whites were so fed up with the lack of protection by the federal 
government that there was talk of forming a separate western nation. Between 1785 
and 1788, John Sevier led settlers in the western counties of North Carolina—now the 
state of Tennessee—to form a state they called Franklin, or sometimes, the Republic 
of Franklin. Th ey were desperate for support in their battles with local Cherokee and 
Chickasaw. When their petition to become a state failed, they virtually governed themselves 
as an independent nation. Sensing an opportunity, Spanish authorities off ered 
fi nancial support to the settlers if they would affi liate with Spain rather than the United 
States, but North Carolina authorities successfully reasserted authority in the region. 
When he became president in 1789, Washington wanted to be sure there were no similar 
interests in independence or foreign alliances in the western lands claimed by the 
United States.

202 Part III A New Birth of Freedom—Creating the United States of America, 1754–1800 
As one of his fi rst moves aft er taking offi ce, Washington set out on a series of grand 
tours of the United States. He meant to see and be seen with the citizens of the country. 
People loved seeing in person this war hero, now president, and the tours were an 
important eff ort to solidify the country behind the president and the constitution. 
A lifelong soldier, Washington also played a major role in the wars between the United 
States government and the Native American tribes that dominated the Ohio region 
when he came to offi ce. In spite of a series of defeats for the U.S. Army, Washington 
kept pressing his case and eventually defeated the tribes that had long inhabited the 
Ohio River Valley. When Hamilton’s eff orts to raise taxes created an armed uprising 
of farmers along the Pennsylvania frontier—the so-called Whiskey Rebellion— 
Washington himself took charge of the army that put down the rebellion but also 
treated the rebels far more leniently than some like Alexander Hamilton wanted. 
Finally, in his second term in offi ce, Washington turned most of his attention to foreign 
policy, specifi cally the growing tension between revolutionary France and the United 
States, which continued even aft er he left offi ce. 
The President Tours the Nation 
To use his personal prestige to consolidate public support for the new government, 
Washington went on tours of the nation, not an easy task at a time when roads were poor 
and horses and carriages were the only means of transport once one left the waterways. 
I n 1790, as part of one of his national tours, Washington visited 
Newport, Rhode Island, and its Touro Synagogue, the oldest 
synagogue in the United States. Moses Seixas, speaking for the 
congregation, wrote to Washington, thanking him for the visit. 
Washington responded with a statement of his commitment to 
religious freedom. In a nation that was still sorting out the meaning 
of democracy, and at a time before the First Amendment was added 
to the Constitution, Washington’s letter was an important statement 
of American freedom. 
Letter from Moses Seixas 
Permit the children of the stock of Abraham to approach you 
with the most cordial affection and esteem for your person and 
merits—and to join with our fellow citizens in welcoming you to 
Newport.…Deprived as we heretofore have been of the invaluable 
rights of free Citizens, we now with a deep sense of gratitude 
to the Almighty disposer of all events behold a Government, 
erected by the Majesty of the People—a Government, which 
to bigotry gives no sanction, to persecution no assistance—but 
generously affording to all Liberty of conscience, and immunities 
of Citizenship: deeming every one, of whatever Nation, tongue, 
or language equal parts of the great governmental Machine.… 
Letter from G. Washington to the Hebrew 
Congregation in Newport Rhode Island 
While I receive, with much satisfaction, your Address replete 
with expressions of affection and esteem; I rejoice in the 
opportunity of assuring you, that I shall always retain a grateful 
remembrance of the cordial welcome I experienced in my visit 
to Newport….The Citizens of the United States of America have 
a right to applaud themselves for having given to mankind 
examples of an enlarged and liberal policy: a policy worthy of 
imitation. All possess alike liberty of conscience and immunities 
of citizenship. It is now no more that toleration is spoken 
of, as if it was by the indulgence of one class of people, that 
another enjoyed the exercise of their inherent natural rights. 
For happily the Government of the United States, which gives 
to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance, requires 
only that they who live under its protection should demean 
themselves as good citizens, in giving it on all occasions their 
effectual support.

Nevertheless, between 1789 and 1791, he rode by carriage and horseback from New 
York through much of New England and across the South. Th e trip allowed him to 
address important issues such as religious freedom, hear from citizens, and personalize 
a distant national government. Welcoming the nation’s greatest hero and leader was the 
social event of the season for these small-town residents, and for many it consolidated 
the sense of belonging to one nation. Privately, Washington sometimes complained 
about the accommodations, but he was convinced that his speeches and meetings had 
done much to build good will and support for the nation and his administration. 
Indian Wars: Building the U.S. Army 
Washington was deeply concerned about how to handle the frontier Indian tribes. He 
blamed much of the problem on the “turbulence and disorderly conduct” of settlers 
who would not wait for permission or protection to enter the new territories but then 
who complained bitterly when Indians attacked them. Still, he needed to act with 
caution because he wanted these new settlers to be loyal citizens despite his frustration 
with them. On a personal level, he himself, like many members of Congress, had 
speculated in western lands and stood to make money if the land could actually be 
opened to white settlement. But given the poverty of the federal government— 
including only 600 soldiers in the army when Washington became president—the 
president hardly commanded a force that could make much of a diff erence in the vast 
western territory. 
Th e chief representative of the U.S. government on the western frontier, Arthur 
St. Clair, was both the appointed governor of what were then the Northwest 
Territories of the United States—lands Indians claimed—and a major general in 
the army. Congress had ordered him to end all Indian titles to the lands between 
the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. But St. Clair lacked the resources to do his job. 
His strategy, as he wrote to Washington, was to divide and conquer—to seek many 
treaties with individual tribes rather than one overall treaty with all the tribes. 
But this strategy did not go well. In 1789, just before Washington’s inauguration, 
St. Clair negotiated several treaties with one group of Indian leaders at Fort 
Harmar, but most other leaders and most tribes rejected these treaties, making 
them virtually useless. 
In 1790, Washington asked Congress to expand the army so it could force the 
tribes of the Ohio region to “sue for peace before a blow is struck at them.” Congress 
agreed to expand the army to 1,000 men and added 1,500 state militia from Kentucky, 
Virginia, and Pennsylvania. Th is increased force, however, was still not strong enough 
to win the victories the president thought essential. 
In September 1790, 1,450 troops under General Josiah Harmar marched into 
the territory of the Miami and Shawnee to destroy villages and crops as a show of 
force that might stop the attacks on frontier settlements. In October, Harmar’s army 
was attacked by Shawnees, Miamis, and Pottawattamies, and 500 of the Americans 
were killed before the rest retreated. Aft er this defeat, attacks on white settlements 
continued, and attempts at negotiating peace failed. Although some Indians, led by 
a Seneca named Cornplanter, sought to make a separate peace for their tribes, most 
others rejected the government’s proposed treaties. 
In 1791, President Washington ordered a new attack. General St. Clair himself 
led 2,000 troops in a direct assault on the Miamis on the Wabash River in what 
is now Indiana. On November 4, 1791, 1,500 Indians from several tribes led by 
Mishikinakwa—or Little Turtle—of the Miami and Blue Jacket of the Shawnee 
killed over 500 troops and most of the expedition’s female camp followers. 
Washington was shocked that St. Clair had allowed his army “to be cut to pieces, 
hacked, butchered, tomahawked,” and relieved St. Clair of his command. As 1792 
began, most of the area the United States called its Northwest Territory was in 
Indian hands. 
The battles between the U.S. military and a 
confederation of tribes that were fought between 
1785 and 1795 were sometimes referred to as 
the Northwest Indian War, or Little Turtle’s War, in 
recognition of the central role of the Miami leader, 
Little Turtle, in the early defeats of the U.S. forces.

Th roughout 1792, the Washington administration and many of the Indians tried 
to negotiate. In June 1792, Joseph Brant, the Mohawk leader who had earlier traveled 
to London to meet with King George III, went to Philadelphia and met with President 
Washington, becoming one of the few people to meet with both national leaders. Th e 
meeting with Washington was cordial but did not lead to any fi nal agreements, and Brant 
continued to strengthen his ties with Britain. Brant and most of the Iroquois, Shawnee, 
and Miami leaders were determined to allow no white settlement west of the Ohio River 
and demanded that the United States abandon its forts in that territory. But white settlers 
continued to move across the Ohio River. Th ey and their government wanted more 
land. Some of the negotiations were good faith eff orts. Some were a sham. All failed. 
While some in Congress and the press argued for peace and an end to the waste of 
money and lives in western military campaigns, Washington called for a full-scale war 
on the Indians. Secretary of War Knox began to create a truly professional army of 5,000 
men. In late 1793, he launched a third military campaign in the Northwest Territory. 
In place of the disgraced St. Clair, Washington appointed Anthony Wayne 
(known as “Mad” Anthony Wayne) as major general of the U.S. Army. Wayne trained 
his army, and during the winter of 1793–94, they built a new base, Fort Recovery, on 
the site of St. Clair’s defeat. In August 1794, Wayne’s army defeated a large Indian 
force led by the Shawnee Blue Jacket at the Battle of Fallen Timbers, near present-day 
Toledo, Ohio. Aft er fi erce fi ghting among twisted tree limbs and trunks, the Indians 
broke ranks and retreated. British forces at the nearby Fort Miami did not support 
their Indian allies, and Wayne decided not to attack the British fort (see Map 7-1 ). 
A year later, the Treaty of Greenville ended major hostilities between Indians and 
whites in the future states of Ohio and Indiana. Th e treaty established Indian reserves

while ceding most of the remaining lands to white settlers. For the tribes of the 
Northwest, the Battle of Fallen Timbers and the Treaty of Greenville were the end of 
their control of the territory. Th e defeated Indian leader Little Turtle was blunt, telling 
General Anthony Wayne, “You have pointed out to us the boundary line between 
the Indians and the United States, but I now take the liberty to inform you, that the 
line cuts off from the Indians a large portion of the country, which has been enjoyed 
by my forefathers from time immemorial, without molestation or dispute.” But aft er 
Fallen Timbers there was little that the tribal leaders could do. Many Indians moved 
to British Canada or further west into the Louisiana Territory, still formally controlled 
by Spain. Although groups of Indians and settlers continued minor skirmishes for 
another 20 years, 1795 was the end of the Indian Wars in the Ohio region. Eff orts to 
survey settlements and create local governments came quickly. 
Washington’s goals for the Northwest Territory and for dealing with the Indians 
were mostly accomplished. White settlers got the lands they wanted, the British lost 
their most powerful ally in the region, and the power and prestige of the U.S. Army 
were enhanced. Settlement continued long aft er Washington left offi ce, and Ohio was 
admitted as a state in 1803. Indiana followed in 1816, Illinois in 1818, but Michigan 
and Wisconsin much later in 1837 and 1848, respectively. 
Whiskey Tax, Whiskey Rebellion 
When a compromise by Hamilton, Jefferson, and Madison led Congress to pass 
Hamilton’s economic plan in 1782, it solved one set of problems but created new ones. 
Paying off the debt required more income for the federal government than the customs 
tax alone could raise. Aft er considering several options, Hamilton hit on the idea of 
taxing whiskey. If there were to be new taxes, a tax on whiskey seemed less undesirable 
than most options. Even Hamilton’s long-time opponent James Madison supported it 
as a way to increase “sobriety and thereby prevent disease and untimely deaths.” Like 
the “sin taxes” of later generations, the tax on whiskey seemed an easy call. However, 
what seemed easy in New York and Philadelphia was seen by farmers in western 
Pennsylvania as a direct attack on their livelihood. 
Western Pennsylvania and neighboring parts of Appalachia had been settled long 
before the Revolution, primarily by Scots-Irish Presbyterians who were willing to

After a series of Native American victories, the U.S. Army’s victory at the Battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794 
brought organized resistance to an end. A year later, in 1795, defeated tribal leaders agreed to the Treaty 
of Greenville, ceding most of the land of the Northwest to white settlement. This picture shows Little Turtle 
talking with General Anthony Wayne.

fi ght Indians for land and who wanted to maintain their culture, including their love 
for whiskey. Turning corn, their staple crop, into whiskey was also the best way to get 
the crop to market. A farmer could distill corn into whiskey at home and then transport 
a keg, or several kegs, on a horse or mule over the mountains and sell the liquid corn at 
$16 a keg in East Coast markets, making a considerable profi t. It was much easier and 
more profi table than trying to transport raw corn over the mountains, and between 
1783 and 1795 when Spain closed the port of New Orleans to American goods, transporting 
any products down the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers was not an option. 
Hamilton’s tax, however, ate up the profi t. Since the tax was applied uniformly 
to all producers, small producers of whiskey ended up paying a higher percentage 
of their income than did those producing larger amounts. Moreover, the tax singled 
out these whiskey-making farmers and not others such as land speculators (of which 
Washington was one). Western farmers complained that the tax discriminated 
against them, and it did. Th ey were already angry. Most frontier farmers had opposed 
adopting the Constitution when it was being debated in 1787 and 1788. Now only a 
few years later, the fi rst administration elected under that document wanted to destroy 
their best hope of economic prosperity. Th ey rebelled. 
The Whiskey Rebellion began with modest protests. The Pennsylvania, North 
Carolina, Maryland, Virginia, and Georgia legislatures passed resolutions opposing 
the tax. When these actions were not heeded by the administration, protests escalated 
quickly. Tax collectors were shot at, tarred and feathered, or beaten and threatened with 
scalping. In a mass meeting in Pittsburgh, rebels agreed to fi ght for the repeal of the tax 
and to treat tax collectors with the “contempt they deserve.” In 1793 and 1794, no federal 
taxes were collected in Kentucky or Pennsylvania’s western counties. A convention 
of more than 200 farmers at Parkinson’s Ferry debated armed resistance to the national 
government. In 1794, a federal marshal, David Lennox, and John Neville, a friend of 
Washington’s from the Revolution, were attacked by armed men when they tried to 
collect the tax. Neville’s house was burned, and he and his family barely escaped. On 
August 1, 6,000 rebels met outside of Pittsburgh and, modeling their behavior on revolutionaries 
in France, created a Committee of Public Safety, erected a guillotine, and 
made plans to attack the government garrison at Pittsburgh to gain weapons. 
Hamilton advised Washington to “exert the full force of the Law against 
Off enders.” But Washington worried about losing the westerners’ allegiance to the 
United States. Th roughout 1792 and 1793, he sought to negotiate with the whiskey 
makers. Washington’s overtures were seen as weakness by some of the Whiskey 
Rebels. Farmers who paid the tax were attacked and their stills destroyed.

By the summer of 1794, as the riots spread and after the attack on Neville, 
Washington had had enough. He saw the attacks on federal offi cials and the refusal to 
pay the taxes as part of a plot to overthrow the Constitution. He decided to act. 
Given the size of the insurgency, Washington called for 12,000 troops to be drawn 
from the militias of New Jersey, Maryland, and Virginia. Th e president himself took 
command of the force and, with Hamilton at his side, marched across Pennsylvania. 
While Hamilton promised that every rebel they caught would be “skewered, shot, or 
hanged on the fi rst tree,” Washington remained “grave, distant, and austere.” 
In the end, the sheer size of Washington’s army frightened the rebels and ended 
the rebellion. Most of the rebel farmers either accepted Washington’s off er of amnesty 
if they would swear loyalty to the United States or melted away into the woods and 
hollows. Th e army arrested 150 rebel leaders, but only two were convicted of treason, 
and Washington pardoned both of them. But the back of the rebellion had been 
broken. Federal authority—loved by some, hated by others—was supreme. 
The French Revolution Comes to America 
News and ideas moved slowly in the 1700s. People had to wait weeks to hear about 
developments in another state and months to hear about foreign events. Yet to a 
surprising degree, Americans in the 1790s were well informed about and infl uenced 
by developments in Europe, most of all by the French Revolution about which most 
Americans had strong opinions. 
If much of Washington’s first term was taken up with economic matters and 
Indian wars, his second term (1793–1797) was dominated by the French Revolution 
( Table 7-1 ). Indeed, if revolution had not erupted in France, Washington might have 
served only one term and retired as he wanted to do.

By 1792, Washington believed that he had stabilized the country and would 
have been happy to retire. However, both Hamilton and Jefferson, by then bitter 
enemies, told Washington that the country still needed him, in part because each saw 
Washington as a buff er against the other’s policies. Most of their followers agreed. Th e 
most powerful argument for a second term, however, was Washington’s realization 
that revolutionary France would soon be at war with Austria and Britain, and that 
war would make American diplomacy much more diffi cult. He could not walk away 
from what he saw as a coming foreign policy crisis even as he insisted “at my age, the 
love of retirement grows every day more & more powerful.” His personal popularity 
exceeded any disagreement with his policies, and he was reelected unanimously. 
When word of the European war reached Philadelphia in the spring of 1792, 
the Washington administration issued a formal Proclamation of Neutrality. Where 
Washington had seemed to favor Hamilton in economic matters, he favored 
Jeff erson—and Jeff erson’s successor Edmund Randolph—on foreign policy. When 
France’s revolutionary government asked for America to pay off debt from the 
Revolutionary War earlier than negotiated, Washington agreed. When the French 
announced plans to send a new ambassador, just aft er the execution of King Louis 
XVI in January 1793, Washington agreed to receive him. Washington was determined 
to maintain neutrality. He would not let Hamilton’s pro-British views draw him into a 
war, much as he disliked some of the news from France. 
However, the new French ambassador, Edmond-Charles Genêt—Citizen Genêt as 
he was called, using the title that every person in France adopted if they wanted to keep 
their head—was as undiplomatic as a diplomat could be. He landed in Charleston, 
South Carolina, and immediately began commissioning American vessels to attack 
British shipping in direct violation of Washington’s neutrality policies. He also purchased 
munitions for France and enlisted volunteers to attack Spanish Florida. Th en 
he went to Philadelphia to meet the president. 
Washington had long mastered the art of showing icy displeasure. Having heard 
about Genêt’s actions in Charleston, he met Genêt with great formality, standing 
under a picture of Louis XVI, America’s ally during its Revolution, whom Genêt’s 
government had just executed. In the nation’s capital of Philadelphia, Genêt continued 
to raise arms for privateers to attack the British and recruit soldiers from Kentucky to 
attack Florida. Washington then demanded that the French government recall Genêt, 
which it did early in 1794. (Fearing execution if he returned to France, Genêt then 
asked for asylum and settled in New York as a private citizen.) But in Genêt’s brief 
tenure as ambassador, the Citizen Genêt Aff air , as it came to be called, did lasting 
harm, inspiring hostility toward France among President Washington, Vice President 
John Adams, and other officials, while arousing more enthusiasm for the French 
Revolution among some Americans. 
While Washington found it easy to dismiss Citizen Genêt, he could not as 
easily dismiss Americans’ support for the French Revolution. In the first years of 
the revolution in France, most Americans strongly supported developments in the 
country’s oldest ally. When French citizens stormed the Bastille prison in July 1789, 
Lafayette, who had fought with Washington during the Revolution, sent the keys 
to the former prison to the president. Conservative Federalists joined with staunch 
Antifederalists in celebrating the emergence of a new constitutional state in Europe. 
Some Federalists soon began to have doubts about the French Revolution, 
however. For those who worried that deference and hierarchy were disappearing 
all too fast in the United States, news of riots and killings in France were terrifying. 
For the emerging republican movement, however, the news from France was most 
encouraging. Thomas Jefferson never stopped believing that the revolution was a 
grand moment in history, even if he was uncomfortable with what he viewed as its 
excesses. Once Britain joined the war against revolutionary France, many Americans 
sided with France despite offi cial neutrality.

Chapter 7 Practicing Democracy 209 
Democratic-Republican Societies supporting the French Revolution sprang up 
across the United States. Th e fi rst society was established in Philadelphia, but before 
long there were dozens, from Maine to South Carolina and from coastal cities to 
backcountry hamlets. Th ese grassroots societies were more radical than anything even 
Jeff erson was comfortable with. Some of those who joined the Democratic-Republican 
Societies were farmers who were angry with the federal government and ready for 
some revolutionary activity of their own. But the largest societies were in East Coast 
cities, where anti-British sentiment still ran deep. Th ere, small-time merchants and 
manufacturers, mechanics, and other citizens were angry at the arrogance of an 
older, Federalist aristocracy and anxious to make their own place in the new nation. 
Members of these societies had great hopes for the ideals—if not all the tactics and 
the bloodshed—of the French Revolution and wanted to defend it. Not accidentally, 
most of the members of these societies also disliked Hamilton’s economic policies 
as well as the expanding power of the federal government and supported the 
Jeff ersonian opposition in elections, even if the Democratic-Republican leaders in 
Congress kept their distance from them. 
Regardless of differences, the president was generally considered above 
politics, so dissenters usually avoided direct criticisms of Washington himself. 
Even so, the Democratic-Republican Societies became bastions of hostility to 
many of his policies and closest allies. If the birth of the two-party system can 
be traced to the split between Hamilton and Jefferson over economic issues, 
then the deep divides over the revolution in France solidified the organization 
of the Federalists and the Democratic-Republican Societies and inspired the 
creation of the Democratic-Republican Party in the United States (see Table 7-2 ). 
The Federalists were pro-British and wanted a strong federal government and 
army as well as economic policies that supported commercial development. Th e 
Democratic-Republicans were pro-French and wanted a small federal government, 
more independence for the states and individuals, less commercial development, 
and more focus on independent farmers. Ironically, given all the republican talk 
of liberty and equality, the groups associated with Jeff erson were also much more 
sympathetic to slavery. Many among the Democratic-Republicans saw states’ rights 
as a vehicle for protecting slavery. By contrast, the Federalists tended to see slavery 
as morally wrong and harmful to the nation’s commercial development. 
Washington, who hated the very idea of permanent factions or parties, tried 
hard to stay “above the fray” and unite the factions. For a time he succeeded, which 
explains part of the reason he was unanimously reelected in 1792, but by the end of

his second term in office in 1797 more people were coming to see him as another 
Federalist leader. If he had run for a third term—something he had no intention of 
doing—the election would certainly not have been unanimous, though it is diffi cult to 
imagine a person of his enormous popularity being defeated. 
U.S. anger at Britain was not fueled only by memories of 1776. In the 1790s, British 
soldiers still held Fort Detroit and Fort Niagara (near present-day Buff alo) in violation 
of the Treaty of Paris. In the summer of 1793, fearing that American neutrality was a 
cover for selling American grain to all sides in the European war, the British government 
issued Orders in Council (orders from the King through his Privy Council— 
the equivalent of Executive Orders in the United States) that banned all American 
commercial links with France or the French Caribbean islands. By 1794, the Royal 
Navy had taken 400 merchant sailors prisoner. Farmers could not sell their wheat, 
and dockworkers had no jobs. Th ere were growing calls for war with Britain, which 
might help France, rid the frontier of the British, and end the restrictions on shipping. 
Washington, however, was determined to avoid war. He sent Chief Justice John Jay, 
who had been foreign secretary under the Articles of Confederation, to London to 
resolve the problems. For a short moment, Jay’s appointment as U.S. representative to 
London quieted the calls for war. 
But the treaty Jay negotiated with Britain late in 1794 accomplished little of 
what Washington wanted. Britain did agree to pay compensation for its attacks on 
shipping since 1793, but not to end the ban on neutral shipping to France or to 
pay compensation for earlier American losses. While Britain also promised again 
to remove its troops from the Mississippi Valley, it had been ignoring its own 
promises to do so for a decade, and there was little reason to assume that it would 
now change policy. Th e most Jay could say of the treaty he had negotiated was “It 
breaks the ice.” Washington was bitterly disappointed that Jay had not accomplished 
more but sent Jay’s Treaty to the Senate for ratifi cation anyway. Th e Senate vote in 
1795 showed the growing divisions in the country. All 20 Senators identifi ed with 
the Federalists in the Senate voted for the treaty, and all 10 associated with the 
Democratic-Republicans voted against it. Th e public attacks against Washington, 
which had been muted up to this point—in part because of his personal popularity 
and in part because many believed the president should be above attack—now 
became much louder. 
In the fi nal year of the Washington administration, one signifi cant diplomatic 
victory helped to balance out the previous controversies. While Jay had been in 
London, Washington had sent Th omas Pinckney to Madrid. Where Jay had failed, 
Pinckney’s Treaty succeeded beyond expectations. Worrying that Britain and the 
United States might settle their diff erences at Spain’s expense, the Spanish agreed 
to a treaty that pushed the northern border of Florida farther south and westward 
to the Mississippi and, far more important, opened the Mississippi River 
and the port of New Orleans to U.S. commerce. Access to New Orleans was very 
important. During the colonial era Spain had allowed travel on the Mississippi 
River but, fearing the rising power of the new United States, had closed the port to 
all American citizens aft er the Revolution. With Pinckney’s Treaty, western farmers 
could again ship goods down the Mississippi through New Orleans to world 
markets instead of having to struggle across the Appalachians. In addition, for all 
the uproar over Jay’s Treaty, the British actually honored it, removing their soldiers 
from Niagara and Detroit. Washington believed he could now retire in confi dence 
that the nation was secure.

Chapter 7 Practicing Democracy 211 
THE BIRTH OF POLITICAL PARTIES: ADAMS AND JEFFERSON 
Explain the growing split between the Federalist and Democratic-Republican parties, including 
how the French Revolution and the personal differences between Hamilton, Adams, and 
Jefferson affected American politics. 
Th e framers of the Constitution feared the idea of political parties and the idea of people 
voting for specifi c candidates in a national election for president. Because of these fears, 
they designed the election of the president to be a complex process in which each state 
would have the number of presidential electors equal to its representation in Congress. 
Th ese electors would form the Electoral College. State legislatures could select these 
electors any way they wished. Th e plan did not entail candidates being nominated for 
the presidency. Each elector would get two votes, technically one for president and 
one for vice president, but electors would not diff erentiate the offi ces on their ballots. 
Instead, each elector would vote for whomever he wished as long as his two candidates 
were from diff erent states. Whoever got the most votes from all the electors would be 
president. Th e runner up would be vice president. If no one got a majority of the electoral 
votes, then the election would be resolved in the House of Representatives where each 
state delegation would have one vote in selecting among the top three vote getters in the 
electoral college. No one knew how this complex system would work, but the avoidance 
of nominations or indeed the identifi cation of actual candidates before the selection of 
presidential electors was an attempt to prevent the infl uence of specifi c factions. Since 
there had been a national consensus that George Washington should be the fi rst president 
and since he was reelected unanimously, only Washington’s retirement tested the 
system. Th e fi rst two tests, in 1796 and 1800, did not go well. 
John Adams’s Diffi cult Presidency 
The election in 1796 that made John Adams president was an odd one. By 1796, 
Adams, though never a close friend or political ally of Hamilton, had come to represent 
the Federalists, those who supported the Washington administration’s foreign policy 
and most of Hamilton’s economic policies. Most Federalists also supported Th omas 
Pinckney of South Carolina for vice president and a few, including Hamilton, tried to 
maneuver Pinckney into the presidency. 
Thomas Jefferson was the logical candidate of the Democratic-Republicans, 
that large group—though not yet an organized political party—who sympathized 
with the French Revolution and thought Hamilton had shifted too much power 
to the federal government and to the urban economic elites of New York and 
Philadelphia. Although Aaron Burr of New York was not an offi cial running mate, 
many Democratic-Republicans supported him as their vice presidential candidate. 
Advocates of these views had formed Democratic-Republican Societies in all parts of 
the country, organized their own newspapers, sympathized with the Whiskey Rebels, 
and adopted the French tricolor of red, white, and blue as their political colors. Th ey 
were ready to become a political force in presidential politics. 
Adams and Jefferson remained at home throughout 1796—actually wanting 
to be president after Washington was considered unseemly—but many others 
campaigned for them. A Democratic-Republican paper in Philadelphia called Adams 
“His Rotundity” (he was heavy) and said that he was the “champion of kings, ranks, 
and titles.” Federalist papers said that Jeff erson was an atheist, a friend of the radical 
French Revolutionaries, and a danger to democracy. Th ere were also battles within 
the factions. Aft er Adams learned of Hamilton’s eff orts to make Pinckney president 
instead of him, he called Hamilton “as great a hypocrite as any in the U.S.” 
George Washington also entered the campaign, though without formally 
endorsing a candidate. In September 1796, Washington gave what he called his 
farewell address 6 months before he left offi ce. Later generations saw the speech as the 
grand nonpartisan benediction of the nation’s founder. Contemporaries understood

it diff erently. In the address, Washington said he wanted to warn his country “against 
the baneful eff ects of the spirit of party generally.” A political party would “distract the 
public councils and enfeeble the public administration. It agitates the community with 
ill-founded jealousies and false alarms.” He also warned “that foreign infl uence is one 
of the most baneful foes of republican government.” 
In 1796, most people took the speech to mean “vote for Adams not Jeff erson.” In 
Washington’s mind, the Democratic-Republican Societies embodied “the spirit of party 
generally,” and he had seen how they could foment “riot and insurrection” when he had 
led the army against the Whiskey Rebels. He also feared that Jeff erson’s pro-French views 
represented the “insidious wiles of foreign infl uence.” Although he would never say so 
directly, Washington wanted his vice president to be his successor. He got his wish. 
Of the 139 electoral votes cast in the 1796 election, Adams received 71, all from 
New England, New York, and New Jersey, while Jefferson received 68, all from 
Pennsylvania and the southern states. So Adams and Jeff erson, these two long-time 
political rivals, became president and vice president, respectively. 
Th e anger of the 1796 campaign cooled quickly. Th e pro-Jeff erson newspaper, the Aurora , 
declared that Adams was a man “possessing great integrity.” One of Jefferson’s strongest 
supporters in Congress, William Branch Giles of Virginia, said, “Th e old man will make a 
good President, too.” Jefferson and Adams exchanged cordial letters, and Adams invited 
the vice president to sit in the Cabinet—which Washington had never done for him—but 
Jeff erson declined. Th e two dined with Washington just aft er Adams’s inauguration, and in his 
inaugural address, Adams insisted that it was his “infl exible determination” to maintain peace 
with all nations, including France, words that surely reassured Jeff erson and his followers. 
But the split between the Federalists and the Democratic-Republicans went too deep 
for soothing words to heal. Diff erences came to a head in Congress in January 1798 when 
Matthew Lyon, a Democratic-Republican from Vermont, ridiculed the ceremonial 
greeting for President Adams and insulted Federalist Roger Griswold of Connecticut. 
Griswold then insulted Lyon who spat in Griswold’s face. Griswold attacked Lyon with 
his cane, and Lyon grabbed a pair of fi replace tongs to fi ght back on the fl oor of the 
House of Representatives. Th e two were pulled apart, but the incident symbolized the 
hatred between the two parties and the depths to which public discourse had sunk. 
Nothing, however, represented the split between the two factions as much as their 
attitudes toward the French Revolution. Barely a week aft er his inauguration, Adams 
received troubling news that the French Directory, the fi ve-member council then ruling 
revolutionary France, had refused to receive Adams’s choice as U.S. 
ambassador to France. Adams had actually chosen Charles Cotesworth 
Pinckney (brother of the Federalist candidate for vice president) to 
improve the U.S.-French relationship, but the French did not see it that 
way. Th e Directory also launched an undeclared war on U.S. shipping. 
In the following months, the French captured 300 American merchant 
ships. From his son, John Quincy Adams, who was serving as 
U.S. Ambassador to Prussia, Adams also heard of a French plan to stir 
up revolt and secession in the western U.S. territories. Th e Federalist 
press called for war against France while the Democratic-Republicans 
claimed it was a false crisis made up by the pro-British Federalists. 
Adams, who was more nonpartisan than his Federalist backers 
had hoped, sought a middle ground. He sent Elbridge Gerry of 
Massachusetts and John Marshall of Virginia to join Pinckney in Paris 
and try to reopen negotiations. But he also asked Congress to establish 
a navy and provide funds to prepare for war if it came. Th e response to 
the new president’s actions broke along partisan lines, with Federalists 
supporting Adams and Democratic-Republicans opposing him. But 
Adams won authorization for a new Department of the Navy and funds 
to build and support three medium-sized warships called frigates.

Chapter 7 Practicing Democracy 213 
However, Adams’s peace overtures to the French did not go well. When his new 
delegation arrived in Paris, the French foreign minister Charles Maurice de Talleyrand 
arranged for agents, whom Adams identified only as “X, Y, and Z,” to inform the 
Americans that negotiations could proceed only if Talleyrand was paid a bribe of $250,000 
and the French government received a loan of $10 to $12 million as well as an apology for 
what the French considered Adams’s belligerent tone. Pinckney’s famous response was 
“No, no, not a sixpence.” In fact, the commissioners were prepared to pay a bribe, not an 
unusual part of diplomacy at the time, but the amount demanded was far too high. 
When word of the so-called “XYZ Aff air” reached Congress and the American 
public in March 1798, Adams’s popularity soared, and many called for a war against 
France to avenge U.S. honor. Federalists in Congress voted to increase the size of the 
U.S. Army and shift its focus from the western frontier to a presumed threat of French 
invasion on the Atlantic coast. Given British naval supremacy, a French invasion 
was improbable. Even if the British did not like the United States, they certainly did 
not want their archenemy France to control any territory in North America. Adams, 
unlike most Federalists, feared a large standing U.S. Army, especially aft er Hamilton 
won appointment as a major general within it. Adams preferred to strengthen the 
Navy to protect U.S. interests. 
In 1798 and 1799, though there was no formal declaration of war, the United 
States engaged in what became known as the Quasi-War with France or, as Adams 
preferred to call it, the “Half-War.” Treaties with France dating back to the American 
Revolution were repealed, and the United States began a trade embargo against 
France. The United States also supported the independence of Haiti, something it 
had not done during the Washington administration. Congress created the Marine 
Corps along with the Navy and armed merchant ships so they could attack French 
ships near the U.S. coast or in the Caribbean. Even if France had the most powerful 
army in Europe, Talleyrand did not really want war with the United States, and he 
began to make peace overtures. U.S. neutrality, if not friendship, would be important, 
Talleyrand thought, if France were to launch a planned invasion of England. 
Th e war hysteria also led Congress to pass the Alien and Sedition Acts , actually 
three separate acts, that irreparably hurt Adams’s reputation even though he did not 
directly request any of them. Federalists had become increasingly fearful of pro-French 
agitation. Massachusetts Congressman Harrison Gray Otis asked, “Do we not know 
that the French nation have organized bands of aliens as well as their own citizens, in 
other countries?” Many Federalists wondered, could it not happen here?

214 Part III A New Birth of Freedom—Creating the United States of America, 1754–1800 
To make sure that French eff orts, aided by Jeff ersonian Democratic-Republicans, 
could not undermine the government and its Federalist leaders, Congress passed the 
Naturalization Act and the Alien Friends Act in June 1798, which were referred to 
as the Alien Acts. Th ese laws lengthened the time to qualify for citizenship from 5 to 
14 years—to ensure that recent pro-French immigrants could not vote—and allowed 
the government to deport anyone deemed dangerous to the United States. While no 
one was actually deported under the acts, many French citizens left the United States 
on their own rather than wait and see what might happen. 
A month later, on July 14, 1798, Congress passed the Sedition Act by a slim majority, 
and Adams signed the law. Th e Sedition Act targeted primarily newspaper editors like 
Benjamin Franklin Bache, editor of the Democratic-Republican Aurora , making any 
“false, scandalous, and malicious” speech against the government, particularly Congress 
or the president, a crime. Unlike the Alien Acts, the Sedition Act was vigorously 
enforced. Democratic-Republican Congressman Matthew Lyon—who earlier had the 
wrestling match with Griswold—was convicted under the law for continuing to criticize 
the Adams administration and spent 4 months in a Vermont jail. (His constituents 
made it clear what they thought of the act when they overwhelmingly reelected Lyon to 
Congress once he was released from jail.) All told, 17 people were tried under the act, 
including a drunk in New Jersey who had “cast aspersions on the President’s posterior” 
and was fi ned the then enormous sum of $150. But newspapers were not silenced, and 
the attack on free speech undermined support for the Federalists. 
Th e Democratic-Republicans attacked the Alien and Sedition Acts. Vice President 
Jeff erson initially counseled “patience with what he saw as “the reign of the witches” 
in the Adams administration, but soon came to view the Alien and Sedition laws as a 
fundamental threat to democracy. In the fall of 1798, he draft ed resolutions, and his 
friends and supporters in the Kentucky legislature adopted his words, that asserted 
a state’s right to declare federal law “void and of no force” within the state’s jurisdiction. 
Virginia’s legislature adopted similar resolutions draft ed by James Madison. 
Both legislatures invited other states to join them, but none did. Nevertheless, the 
Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions drew a sharp line between the two political 
factions. On the Democratic-Republican side, Madison, like Jeff erson, saw the resolutions 
as an appropriate protest within the framework of the Constitution he had 
helped write, and both men saw them as the basic right of state legislatures to nullify 
federal law. But the Federalists saw both resolutions as a fundamental attack on the 
basic authority of the federal government and, indeed, on the Constitution itself. 
While Adams never repudiated the Alien and Sedition Acts, he did end the war 
fever. Through emissaries, Adams received a signal that France did not want war, 
and aft er British Admiral Horatio Nelson destroyed the French fl eet in the Battle of 
the Nile in October 1798, any remote possibility of a French invasion of the United 
States disappeared. Adams had become convinced that Hamilton was trying to stir 
up a war for his own political ambitions. The president called him “a man devoid 
of every moral principle.” In February 1799, Adams told the Senate that he himself 
was committed “to embrace every plausible appearance of probability of preserving 
or restoring tranquility,” and he also asked them to approve a new ambassador 
to France to replace Pinckney. Many Federalists were enraged that Adams would try 
yet again for peace, and he had to endure a shouting match with Hamilton—now a 
private citizen but an infl uential one. He also had to fi re his own Secretary of State 
Timothy Pickering, who was ready for war, and replace him with a close political ally, 
John Marshall (who would later become chief justice of the Supreme Court). But the 
Senate approved William Vans Murray as the new ambassador, and the new mission 
worked. It took all of 1799 and 1800 to negotiate, during which time the government 
of France changed from the Directory to the dictatorship of Napoleon Bonaparte, but 
peace came. Th e Convention of Mortefontaine ended the Quasi-War and protected 
U.S. shipping. Adams disbanded part of the army in May 1800 over the opposition 
Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions

of his own party. He also pardoned John Fries who had led a nonviolent rebellion 
against federal war taxes in Pennsylvania in 1799 and had been sentenced to death 
for treason. Th ese actions cost Adams dearly, particularly among his own Federalists. 
But he considered the choice for peace against war his crowning achievement and 
ordered that his gravestone read “Here lies John Adams, who took upon himself the 
responsibility for peace with France in the year 1800.” 
The Election of 1800 
Th e political diff erences between the two leading candidates for president in 1800, 
President John Adams and Vice President Thomas Jefferson, could not have been 
clearer. But the methods for actually selecting the next president and vice president in 
1800 could not have been more convoluted. None of the problems with the Electoral 
College that were seen in 1796 had been resolved. At that time, political parties had 
been informal alliances of like-minded individuals. By 1800, however, the Federalists 
and Democratic-Republicans were much better organized. Th ey had come to represent

When Congress passed the Alien and Sedition Acts in 1798, a 
firestorm of protest broke out. Leaders of the Democratic- 
Republican Party saw the new laws as a direct attack on freedom of 
speech, a bedrock of democracy. They also opposed the legislation 
because they feared it would foster war with France and expand the 
army, navy, and federal power in general. In response they sought to 
undermine the laws. Jefferson secretly drafted the resolutions below, 
which were adopted by the Kentucky legislature in November 1798, 
while Madison drafted similar resolutions for Virginia. These Kentucky 
and Virginia Resolutions not only attacked the Alien and Sedition Acts 
but also declared that, since the federal government was a compact 
of the states, any state could declare any federal law unconstitutional 
within the bounds of that state. This claim would have far-reaching 
implications in the decades leading up to the Civil War. Although most 
historians see the Alien and Sedition Acts as a dangerous attack on free 
speech, they also see the resolutions as an equally dangerous effort to 
undermine national unity. 
1. Resolved , That the several states composing the United 
States of America are not united on the principle of 
unlimited submission to their general government; but 
that, by compact, under the style and title of a Constitution 
for the United States, and of amendments thereto, they 
constituted a general government for special purposes, 
delegated to that government certain defi nite powers, 
reserving, each state to itself, the residuary mass of right 
to their own self-government; and that whensoever the 
general government assumes undelegated powers, its 
acts are unauthoritive, void, and of no force; that to this 
compact each state acceded as a state, and is an integral 
party; that this government, created by this compact, was 
not made the exclusive or fi nal judge of the extent of the 
powers delegated to itself, since that would have made 
its discretion, and not the Constitution, the measure of its 
powers; but that, as in all other cases of compact among 
powers having no common judge, each party has an equal 
right to judge for itself, as well of infractions as of the mode 
and measure of redress. 
2. Resolved … therefore, also, the same act of Congress, 
passed on the 14th day of July, 1798, and entitled “An Act 
in Addition to the Act entitled ‘An Act for the Punishment 
of certain Crimes against the United States;’” [the Sedition 
Act]…(and all other their acts which assume to create, 
defi ne, or punish crimes other than those so enumerated 
in the Constitution,) are altogether void, and of no force; 
and that the power to create, defi ne, and punish, such 
other crimes is reserved, and of right appertains, solely 
and exclusively, to the respective states, each within its 
own territory.

two distinct philosophies and sets of personal allegiances. Nevertheless, Americans 
still distrusted formal political parties. Within the parties, advocates of different 
positions schemed to defeat not only the other party but also rivals within their own 
party. In December 1799, just as the maneuvering for the 1800 election was starting, 
news came that George Washington had died at his home in Mount Vernon, Virginia. 
People of all political factions mourned the loss of a unifying leader but also knew that 
the next election would be more divisive than ever. 
Despite the fact that most of the Constitution’s authors did not want nominations 
of presidential candidates to occur before the selection of presidential electors, in 1800, 
each party’s Congressional delegations nominated the candidates in semisecret caucuses. 
When the Democratic-Republican caucus met on May 11, 1800, it was clear that 
Jeff erson would be their nominee for president. Several candidates were considered 
for vice president, but the Democratic-Republicans wanted someone who would 
help them win New York, which they saw as the key to the White House. Th e man to 
deliver New York’s votes was Aaron Burr. Few politicians, including Jeff erson, trusted 
or respected Burr, but Jeff erson did not intend to lose the presidency twice. In an illfated 
decision, the caucus and party leaders pledged that every elector would vote for 
both Jeff erson and Burr. Everyone simply assumed that somehow Jeff erson would 
receive the most votes and become president with Burr, the runner up, becoming vice 
president, but that assumption proved to be a serious mistake. 
Federalist maneuvering was equally complicated. Th ere was general agreement 
that failure to support Adams would fatally split the party. But the caucus also chose 
Charles Cotesworth Pinckney of South Carolina, the brother of their 1796 vice 
presidential nominee, to be vice president, in part because he was known to be loyal 
to Hamilton and in part because his refusal to give a bribe to France in the XYZ Aff air 
had made him a hero. Behind the scenes, Hamilton hoped, as he had in 1796, that he 
could somehow engineer Pinckney’s election as president. Once again, Adams found 
out about Hamilton’s plans and was furious. 
Because the Constitution gave each state the right to choose its presidential electors any 
way it wished, the actual voting for those electors was spread out over most of the year. In 
an early but crucial test, Burr was able to ensure New York’s electoral votes for the Jeff erson- 
Burr ticket. Pennsylvania’s Democratic-Republican governor also promised to deliver its 
electoral votes for the Jeff erson-Burr ticket or, if that failed, to simply prevent a vote to 
choose electors from taking place in that state so Adams could not receive any votes there. 
As other states continued to select their presidential electors in the summer and 
fall of 1800, the contest remained fi erce. A Federalist newspaper said a vote for the 
Democratic-Republicans was a vote “for the tempestuous sea of anarchy and misrule; 
for arming the poor against the rich; for fraternizing with the foes of God and man” 
while a Democratic-Republican paper asked people to choose between, “Peace or 
war, happiness or misery, opulence or ruin!” Th e Sedition Act made direct attacks on 
President Adams dangerous, but the press was far from neutral, and anger at that act 
added fuel to the Democratic-Republican fi re. 
Slaves could not vote, and slavery had not been a major issue in the previous 
presidential campaigns, but it was in 1800. Gabriel Prosser and Jack Bowler were 
slaves on a Virginia plantation not far from the state capital in Richmond. Th roughout 
the summer, they were planning a slave uprising. Prosser promised death to all whites 
except “Quakers, Methodists, and French people,” that is, whites known to support 
abolition. Over 1,000 slaves were involved, forging swords from sickles, making their 
own bullets, and designing a fl ag that read “Death or Liberty.” Th e uprising was set 
for Saturday, August 30, when they planned to meet at the Prosser plantation, kill 
the white owners, and march on Richmond. However, a terrible storm on August 30 
scattered the slave army, and Governor James Monroe discovered the plan and called 
out the state militia. Th e leaders of the uprising were quickly tried and executed, but 
the prospect of a slave uprising terrifi ed the southern states.

Th e issue of slavery also complicated the presidential campaign. Both political 
parties were divided internally over it. Adams hated slavery, but Pinckney, his running 
mate, was one of the largest slave owners in South Carolina. Both Jeff erson 
and Burr owned slaves, Jefferson many of them. But Jefferson had also written 
in opposition to slavery. He needed northern Democratic-Republican votes in 
Pennsylvania and New York where abolitionism was gaining ground. Governor 
Monroe and Jeff erson feared that too many slave executions would spark an abolitionist 
upheaval and cost them votes. On the other hand, leniency could cost them 
votes in the fearful southern states where Adams and Pinckney suddenly looked 
like the forces of stability. 
Some slaves saw the ironies of the situation. Most of those arrested, including 
Prosser, simply remained silent, knowing that nothing they said would save them. 
One, however, calmly told the judges: 
I have nothing more to off er than what General Washington would have had to 
off er, had he been taken by the British offi cers and put to trial by them. I have 
ventured my life in endeavouring to obtain the liberty of my countrymen, 
and am a willing sacrifi ce to their cause; and I beg, as a favour, that I may be 
immediately led to execution. I know that you have predetermined to shed my 
blood, why then all this mockery of a trial? 
Th e tension between American freedom and American slavery, which was at the heart 
of the republic, surfaced in the 1800 contest. 
Jeff erson’s religious beliefs also became a major election topic. Yale’s president, 
Timothy Dwight, gave a speech asking whether the country was going to elect “men 
who set truth at nought…who doubt the being and providence of God.” Everyone 
knew who Dwight was talking about, given Jeff erson’s liberal religious views. Many 
clergy and laypeople claimed that Jefferson had renounced the basic beliefs of 
Christianity. In fact, Jeff erson was a deist who believed that God tended to leave the 
universe on its own. Adams himself, who tended to agree with Jeff erson in religious 
matters, though he was more discreet and more oft en seen in established churches, 
privately expressed “indignation at the charge of irreligion,” but did not say anything 
publically during the heat of the campaign.

218 Part III A New Birth of Freedom—Creating the United States of America, 1754–1800 
Th e Hamilton-Adams feud could not be kept so quiet. In the summer of 1800, 
Hamilton wrote A Letter from Alexander Hamilton, Concerning the Public Conduct 
and Character of John Adams, Esq., President of the United States . Hamilton 
seems to have meant the 54-page document for the private use of a few electors, 
whom he was attempting to switch from Adams to Pinckney, but a delighted 
Democratic-Republican press found the document, and it became public. In words 
that could, ironically, have been prosecuted under the Sedition Act, Hamilton 
attacked Adams for his “great intrinsic defects of character,” including “his disgusting 
egotism,” “eccentric tendencies,” “bitter animosity,” and “ungovernable 
temper.” Th e split among the Federalists was complete. Noah Webster, a tough 
Federalist from Connecticut and author of the fi rst American dictionary, wrote to 
Hamilton that, if Jeff erson was elected as a result of this Federalist split, “the fault 
will lie at your door and…your conduct on this occasion will be discerned little 
short of insanity. 
In 1800, the candidates campaigned openly, unlike 1796. The ever-diffident 
Adams, surprisingly, seemed to enjoy campaigning, giving speeches in key states. 
Jeff erson considered similar campaign stops but was dissuaded by Virginia’s Governor 
Monroe. Instead, he engaged in a nonstop correspondence with supporters and in 
less public forms of campaigning, off ering fi nancial and editorial advice to friendly 
newspaper editors. 
Given the advantages that the Democratic-Republicans held, ranging from the 
unpopularity of the Alien and Sedition Acts to the split among the Federalists, the 
election was surprisingly close. Adams swept New England and most of the northern 
states while Jeff erson held strong in New York and Pennsylvania and most of 
the southern states. Th e three-fi ft hs clause, which counted slaves in the population 
though they were not allowed to vote, gave the southern states an advantage in the 
electoral college that ultimately tipped the election for Jeff erson. Th e last state to 
vote was South Carolina, and when the Jeff erson-Burr ticket carried every electoral 
vote in that state, the new Washington, D.C., Democratic-Republican paper Th e 
National Intelligencer ran a headline on December 12, “Splendid Intelligence…Mr. 
Jeff erson may…be considered as our future President.” But it was 
not to be so simple (see Map 7-2 ). 
Because the Democratic-Republicans had been so well organized, 
Jeff erson and Burr each received 73 electoral votes, putting 
them well ahead of Adams and Pinckney. But because Jefferson 
and Burr had each received 73 votes, the House of Representatives 
would now have to decide between two candidates who had tied in 
the election. In addition, though the Democratic-Republicans had 
also won a majority in the new Congress, the old Congress, with a 
Federalist majority, would decide the election. Many Democratic- 
Republicans, including Jeff erson, thought that Burr had engineered 
this outcome to make himself president. Many Federalists suddenly 
gave Burr a second look. As far as anyone knows, Burr did 
not negotiate with the Federalists. But he also did not give way to 
Jeff erson. Th e country was stuck. 
When Congress heard the tally of electoral votes, the outcome 
was 73 for Jeff erson, 73 for Burr, 65 for Adams, 64 for Pinckney, 
and one for John Jay. Th e House then began to vote between the 
top two. But it remained deadlocked. Finally, Hamilton, who 
had fought for so long with Thomas Jefferson on almost every 
major government policy, convinced his fellow Federalists that 
Burr, whom he knew all too well from New York politics, was a 
dangerous man of too much ambition and too little morality.

Quick Review Why did factions and political parties arise in the 1790s? 
CONCLUSION 
George Washington was elected unanimously as the fi rst president of the United States 
in 1789. Th is unity, largely the result of his popularity as the general who had defeated 
the British, would be short lived as factions began to form around personalities and 
around very diff erent ideas of what the government of the new nation should look like. 
Alexander Hamilton, Washington’s secretary of treasury, was an especially forceful 
advocate of a strong and activist central government. Those who agreed with this 
position came to be known as the Federalists. Hamilton had been charged with making 
the government fi nancially solvent. He quickly convinced Congress to pass import 
taxes to pay off the Revolutionary War debts, to build up the national government, 
and especially to fund the U.S. Army. In addition, Hamilton persuaded Congress to 
launch the Bank of the United States as well as establish a currency system and a mint. 
He believed that making possible fi nancial credit for both government and business 
would ensure the strength of the new republic. 
In opposition to Hamilton, Th omas Jeff erson, Washington’s fi rst secretary of state, 
envisioned an idealized agrarian republic with a weak central government. He believed 
that the strongest powers should remain with the states and in the hands of the people. 
Jeff erson distrusted banks, a standing army, and centralized authority. 
As promised to many who ratified the Constitution, James Madison authored 
amendments to the Constitution that became the Bill of Rights. These amendments 
spelled out limits on the federal government. Th ey guaranteed that the nation could not 
establish a state religion, limit free speech or a free press, or prohibit people from keeping 
fi rearms. Th ey also promised protection from illegal search and seizure. Perhaps most 
important to those who initially opposed the Constitution, the Bill of Rights limited the 
power of the federal government itself to only those things that were specifi cally mentioned 
in the Constitution and reserved all else to the states and the people. 
Washington’s tenure as president during two terms in office was filled with 
confl ict. He took the role of mediator and negotiator as oft en as possible, including 
eff orts to balance Hamilton and Jeff erson, but mediating was a messy business. 
In the Northwest Territory, he tried to control disorderly settlers whose support 
he also needed. Aft er illegally moving into territory in the Ohio River Valley and 
Kentucky, those settlers expected support from state and national governments 
when Indians defended their lands. As president, Washington sought a more powerful 
army to manage the confl ict. In spite of initial Native American victories, before 
Washington left offi ce, all of the tribes of the region then known as the Northwest 
had been defeated and millions of acres opened for white settlements. In response to 
a new federal tax on whiskey, a rebellion—the Whiskey Rebellion—broke out among 
settlers in western Pennsylvania who had no intention of paying the tax. With a massive 
show of force, the Washington administration brought the rebellion to an end, 
but once the rule of federal law had been secured, Washington pardoned individual 
rebels. Th e French Revolution began just as Washington was taking offi ce, but it was 
during his second term (1793–1797) that it dominated the administration’s interest. 
Washington was determined to maintain neutrality as revolutionary France went to 
war with Great Britain and as large numbers of Americans came to support each side 
in the war.

220 Part III A New Birth of Freedom—Creating the United States of America, 1754–1800 
Aft er serving as president for two terms, Washington retired. In a close race, his 
vice president John Adams defeated former secretary of state Th omas Jeff erson, and 
under the rules then in force, Adams became president and Jeff erson vice president. 
Four years later, the two again ran against each other, but this time, aft er a hard fought 
and exceedingly complicated election process, Thomas Jefferson became the third 
president of the United States. 
By the time Jeff erson was inaugurated, the factions that Washington abhorred had 
begun to harden into two political parties. Th e Federalists who supported a strong 
central government, a national bank, and the development of commercial enterprise 
were represented in the presidential contests by John Adams, but Alexander Hamilton, 
who privately feuded constantly with Adams, drove the party’s ideas. On the other 
side, the Antifederalists, or Democratic-Republicans, led by Jeff erson, were the party 
of those supporting states’ rights, a weak federal government, and agrarian—oft en 
slaveholding—interests. Once Jeff erson defeated Adams, the Federalists would never 
elect another president, but the philosophical divide between the two parties would 
dominate American politics for decades. 
How well did the early American government under the Constitution uphold its 
spirit and ideals? How did issues not addressed within the document lead to 
controversy later on?

CONVENING A CONGRESS, INAUGURATING A PRESIDENT, 
ADOPTING A BILL OF RIGHTS 
Analyze the fi rst federal elections and the adoption of the Bill 
of Rights. 
Summary 
When Virginia and New Hampshire voted to ratify the 
Constitution in June 1788, it became the law of the land. By the 
spring of 1789, the members of the new Congress had been 
elected and George Washington had been unanimously elected 
president by the 69 presidential electors. As the fi rst president, 
Washington was well aware that every choice he made would 
set a precedent for future presidents. In the summer of 1789, 
the House of Representatives went to work on the Bill of Rights, 
sending 12 amendments to the states on September 25. Ten of 
these amendments were ratifi ed and became the Bill of Rights. 
Collectively, these amendments placed clear limits on the power 
of the new federal government. 
Review Questions

CREATING AN ECONOMY: ALEXANDER HAMILTON AND THE 
U.S. ECONOMIC SYSTEM 
Analyze the enduring argument begun by Hamilton’s economic 
vision for the United States and the alternative vision of 
Jefferson and Madison. 
Summary 
When Washington took office, he faced difficult problems, 
many of them economic. Under the Articles of Confederation, 
the federal government was unable to collect taxes, which meant 
that federal debts were not being paid and that the financial 
status of the United States was in serious trouble. Washington 
appointed Alexander Hamilton as his secretary of the treasury, 
7.1 
7.2 
placing him in charge of solving the fi nancial crisis. In his report 
to Congress on the public credit of the United States, Hamilton 
argued that the federal government should assume all revolutionary 
debt and agree to pay all government promissory notes 
in full. Hamilton’s plans faced signifi cant opposition and were 
passed only aft er a deal in which the capital would be moved 
to a site on the Potomac River. In 1791, again over considerable 
opposition, Hamilton gained Congressional approval for a Bank 
of the United States. Hamilton’s last major report to Congress 
was his Report on Manufactures . In contrast to Jeff erson’s vision 
of an agrarian republic, Hamilton imagined a diverse economy, 
with the federal government playing an important role in the 
stimulation of manufacturing growth.

Th e treaty paved the way for white settlement of the Northwest 
Territory. Hamilton’s tax on whiskey sparked an uprising 
in Kentucky and western Pennsylvania in 1793. In 1784, 
Washington led a federal army into the region to squash the 
rebellion. Washington’s second term was dominated by the 
French Revolution. The revolution complicated the United 
States’ relations with France and Britain. Domestic politics were 
also shaped by the revolution, with political factions developing 
around support for either France or Britain.

Summary 
In 1796, Federalist John Adams was elected president and 
Democratic-Republican Thomas Jefferson was elected vice 
president. Factional division, particularly over U.S. relations 
with France, shaped the Adams presidency. In 1788 and 1789, 
following the XYZ Aff air, France and the United States fought 
what became known as the Quasi-War. War hysteria led 
Congress to pass the Alien and Sedition Acts, which targeted 
the Federalists’ political opponents. In response, Jeff erson and 
Madison produced the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions, 
respectively, which argued that states had the right to nullify 
federal laws, although his resolutions did not pass in the 
Congress. In 1799, Adams began negotiations that led to peace 
with France in 1800. Th e unpopularity of the Alien and Sedition 
Acts, as well as a split among the Federalists, contributed to 
Jefferson’s victory over Adams in the presidential election 
of 1800.

Section II: Short Answer Questions 
Question 3.25 is based on the following two quotations. 
Passage 1 
Th e American revolutionary leaders do not fi t our conventional 
image of revolutionaries—angry, passionate, reckless, maybe 
even bloodthirsty for the sake of a cause. . . . But if we measure 
the radicalism by the amount of social change that actually 
took place—by transformations in the relationships that bound 
people to each other—then the American Revolution was not 
conservative at all; on the contrary: it was as radical and as 
revolutionary as any in history. . . . 
By the time the Revolution had run its course in the early nineteenth 
century, American society had been radically and thoroughly 
transformed. One class did not overthrow another; the poor did not 
supplant the rich. But social relationships—the way people were 
connected one to another—were changed, and decisively so. By the 
early years of the nineteenth century the Revolution had created 
a society fundamentally diff erent from the colonial society of the 
eighteenth century. It was in fact a new society unlike any that had 
ever existed anywhere in the world. . . . 
To focus, as we are today apt to do, on what the Revolution 
did not accomplish—highlighting and lamenting its failure to 
abolish slavery and change fundamentally the lot of women—is 
to miss the great signifi cance of what it did accomplish; indeed 
the Revolution made possible the anti-slavery and women’s rights 
movements of the nineteenth century and in fact all our current 
egalitarian thinking. Th e Revolution not only radically changed 
the personal and social relationships of people, including the 
position of women, but also destroyed aristocracy as it had been 
understood in the Western world for at least two millennia.

Passage 2 
For more than two centuries historians have written about the 
American Revolution striving to capture the “life and soul” of 
which Jeff erson spoke. . . . 
[W]e have not appreciated the lives and labors, the sacrifi ces 
and struggles, the glorious messiness, the hopes and fears of 
diverse groups that fought in the longest and most disruptive 
war in our history with visions of launching a new age fi lling 
their heads. Little is known, for example of Th omas Peters, 
an African-born slave who made his personal declaration of 
independence in early 1776, fought for the freedom of African 
Americans, led former slaves to Nova Scotia aft er the war, and 
completed a pilgrimage for unalienable rights by shepherding 
them back to Africa to participate in the founding of Sierra 
Leone. Why are the history books virtually silent on Dragging 
Canoe, the Cherokee warrior who made the American 
Revolution into a two-decade life-sapping fi ght for his people’s 
life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness? We cannot capture 
the “life and soul” of the Revolution without paying close 
attention to the wartime experiences and agendas for change 
that engrossed backcountry farmers, urban craft smen, deepblue 
mariners, female camp followers and food rioters—those 
ordinary people who did most of the protesting, most of the 
fi ghting, most of the dying, and most of the dreaming about 
how a victorious America might satisfy the yearnings of all its 
peoples. . . .

3.25 Based on the two contrasting historical arguments, 
complete the following three tasks: 
a. Briefl y explain the main point made by Gordon Wood 
in Passage 1. 
b. Briefl y explain the main point made by Gary Nash in 
Passage 2. 
c. Identify which historical interpretation you fi nd more 
persuasive and support your selection with historical 
evidence not supplied by either passage, explaining how 
it supports your position. 
3.26 George Washington created many precedents while in 
offi ce, including giving a farewell address. However, 
Washington’s farewell was more of a warning about 
party factionalism and the need to remain neutral from 
European aff airs. 
a. Based on historical events during the Washington 
administration, was there valid cause for Washington to 
be concerned about how his successors would deal with 
party factionalism? 
b. Based on historical events during the Washington 
administration, was there valid cause for Washington to 
be concerned about how his successors would deal with 
European aff airs? 
c. Using the historical evidence, discuss which of these 
two threats was the greatest challenge to the new 
republic. 
3.27 Historians oft en debate when historical periods begin 
based on which historical forces and events they give 
priority to and which conceptual lens they use to interpret 
historical signifi cance. Keeping that in mind, answer these 
questions: 
a. Identify the date that best describes the beginnings of 
American independence: 1651, 1721, 1741, 1754, 1765, 
1774, or 1776. 
b. Identify historical information (people, places, ideas, 
and events) that support your selection, and make 
an argument why the date you chose is the best date 
for the origins of the Revolution. 
c. Identify which date would be the best alternative date 
to explain the origins of the American Revolution, 
and make a counterargument for that position, using 
appropriate historical evidence.

8 Creating a New People, 
Expanding the Country 
On Inauguration Day, March 4, 1801, Th omas Jeff erson had breakfast 
at his boardinghouse in Washington, D.C., and then walked up New 
Jersey Avenue to the unfi nished Capitol building to take the oath of 
offi ce as the nation’s third president. He was sworn in by one of his political 
archenemies, the Federalist Chief Justice John Marshall. In his inaugural 
address, Jeff erson acknowledged the bitterness of the 1800 presidential campaign 
but continued: 
But every difference of opinion is not a difference of principle. 
We have called by diff erent names brethren of the same principle. 
We are all Republicans, we are all Federalists. If there be any among 
us who would wish to dissolve this Union or to change its republican 
form, let them stand undisturbed as monuments of the safety 
with which error of opinion may be tolerated where reason is left 
free to combat it. 
Federalist ideas, which were at the core of the Constitution and the fi rst 
two presidential administrations, were increasingly out of touch with the 
democratic tone of the new century. As the new president made clear, more 
trust and less fear as well as dynamic exchanges and signifi cant freedom 
were to characterize Jeff ersonian democracy and his emerging Democratic- 
Republican Party. 
Republican ideals and an explosion of interest in religion defi ned the politics 
and culture of Jeff ersonian America. Th is chapter will examine these ideals and 
explore their eff ect on the growth of religious bodies as well as on the expansion 
and consolidation of American territory and power through the Louisiana 
Purchase, the War of 1812, and policies such as the Monroe Doctrine.

JEFFERSON AND THE REPUBLICAN IDEAL 
Explain how Jefferson’s republicanism shaped and reflected the nation’s democratic 
culture. 
From the moment he took offi ce, Jeff erson set a new tone for the federal government. 
His inaugural address emphasized conciliation and national unity while his actions 
involved dramatic changes. Jeff erson wanted to preside over a country in which social 
equality (among white male citizens) and individual freedom were the order of the 
day. Th e social hierarchies that had characterized the colonial era and the fi rst years 
of the republic were, he thought, long out of date. He wanted a limited government 
that fostered the kind of freedom that was his ideal. Most of his countrymen, it seems, 
agreed. 
Jeff erson quickly sold the horses and coaches that John Adams had used. In place 
of formal state dinners, he held smaller dinner parties. What some called a “pell-mell” 
seating arrangement marked these gatherings at the White House. There was no 
assigned seating and no respect for the rank of the dignitaries who attended. Th e president 
simply sat down with whomever he found interesting and expected the other 
guests to do the same. A British diplomat described the new president as a host “with 
a most perfect disregard to ceremony both in his dress and manner” and vowed never 
to attend another White House dinner. 
Th ese changes in tone were not trivial. Th ey represented what was quickly becoming 
the dominant ideology of the United States quite diff erent from that of the Federalists: 
a commitment to a Democratic-Republican government but also republicanism in 
personal styles and political beliefs (see Table 9-1 ). Americans valued equality not only 
in terms of representation in government but also in terms of how Americans treated 
others—at state dinners in the White House, at town meetings, and in taverns and 
family homes. Th ey also valued a notion of freedom in which a nation of independent 
farmers could make their own decisions, independent of one another if they preferred. 
American republicanism was a new way for citizens to relate to each other, emphasizing 
equality and independence far more than the class separation, deference, and 
dependence that had marked British North America and Great Britain itself. 
8.1 
republicanism 
A complex, changing body of ideas, values, 
and assumptions that developed in the 
United States in the late 1790s and early 
1800s around Thomas Jefferson and James 
Madison’s political organizing and their 
campaigns for the presidency.

Federalists Democratic-Republicans

Constitution 
Began as an informal protest movement led 
by Jeff erson and Madison in response to 
Hamilton’s economic plans 
Although George Washington insisted he 
stood above party and hated the idea of 
political parties, he was usually considered 
to be a Federalist. The Federalists supported 
John Adams for president in the elections of 
1796 and 1800. 
By the 1796 and 1800 elections, Democratic- 
Republicans formed a well-defi ned caucus 
within the Congress, though hardly a modern 
political party. Between 1800 and 1820s, 
it was the nation’s majority party—the 
Democratic-Republican Party—sometimes 
called the Jeff ersonian Republican or simply 
the Republican Party. 
The party wanted a strong national government, 
favored Hamilton’s economic reforms, 
and generally supported stronger U.S. ties 
with Great Britain. 
The party sought a smaller federal government, 
wanted less federal involvement in 
economic matters, and generally favored 
France over Great Britain. 
After the 1800 election, the Federalists never 
again dominated the national government 
but remained strong in New England for 
another 20 years. They nominated their last 
presidential candidate in 1816. 
By the 1820s, it was the only remaining 
political party before splitting into the 
Democrats and the Whigs.

8.1 
There are many ironies in Jefferson’s success. Jefferson, whose lack of religious 
orthodoxy was an issue in his campaigns, led the country during one of the great revivals 
of religion. Jeff erson, the sophisticated aristocrat in his personal life, presided over 
White House events with a sense of informality that many offi cials found insulting. 
Jeff erson, a slaveholder who had great misgivings about slavery, led the country during 
the time when slavery became stronger and more entrenched as well as a source of bitter 
divisiveness. And Jeff erson, the believer in an agrarian vision of the United States, 
presided over a growing commercial economy that saw an expansion of U.S. territory 
as well as the rise of cities, banks, and corporations, which would have pleased his old 
rival Alexander Hamilton much more than it ever impressed Th omas Jeff erson. Th e 
apparent disconnect between Jeff erson the political leader and Jeff erson the person 
generated much criticism but, those ironies also refl ected the dramatic changes afl oat 
in the nation. 
Jeff erson the Political Leader 
Jeff erson’s changes in the government went far beyond symbolism. He shrank the federal 
bureaucracy while doubling the landmass of the United States. Jeff erson thought the 
bureaucracy he had inherited from John Adams was “too complicated, too expensive” 
and vowed to cut it, though that government was hardly a large one. Th e largest federal 
offi ce, the War Department, included the secretary of war, one accountant, 14 clerks, 
and two messengers. Th e secretary of state had one chief clerk, six other clerks, and 
a messenger. Th e attorney general did not even have a clerk. Still, Jeff erson thought 
it was too big and cut it. In addition, having always feared the impact of a standing 
army, he cut the size of the army in the west and the size of the navy that patrolled the 
Atlantic Ocean. He founded the military academy at West Point only because he wanted 
to replace Federalist offi cers with a thoroughly professional (and Republican) offi cer 
corps. Jeff erson’s secretary of the treasury persuaded him to keep Hamilton’s Bank of 
the United States, but Jeff erson was never enthusiastic about the bank, and a Republican 
Congress refused to renew its charter in 1811, aft er he had left offi ce. 
While he kept the tariff —the tax on imported goods—Jeff erson abolished all internal 
taxes. Most Americans dealt with the federal government only through the post 
offi ce during the Jeff erson, Madison, and Monroe administrations. Washington, D.C., 
had fewer than 10,000 residents, most of whom lived in boardinghouses. A British 
diplomat described it as a capital city “like no other in the world” where one could get 
stuck in the mud on Pennsylvania Avenue, and a carriage had to avoid tree stumps 
and grazing cows, but there was “excellent snipe [a type of game bird] shooting…close 
under the wall of the Capitol.” Jeff erson liked it that way. He wanted a small federal 
government. For Jeff erson, the states, not the federal government, were supposed to 
have the “principal care of our persons, our property, and our reputation.” 
One of Jeff erson’s early eff orts to shrink the federal government sparked one of the 
most signifi cant Supreme Court decisions in U.S. history. Th e new Jeff ersonian majority 
in Congress repealed the Judiciary Act of 1801, which had expanded the number of 
federal judges and which John Adams had signed just before leaving offi ce. Following 
Jeff erson’s views, Congress wanted fewer federal judges, and it especially disliked the 
Federalist judges that Adams had appointed in his last days in offi ce, which some called 
“ midnight judges ” because of the hour at which the outgoing president appointed 
them. Congressional leaders and President Jefferson virtually dared the Supreme 
Court, particularly, Chief Justice Marshall, a Federalist whom Adams had appointed, 
to declare Congress’s actions unconstitutional. Th ey promised that if the Court did so, 
Congress would reduce the Court’s authority. But Marshall was a wily judge. He waited 
for the right case to make his decision. One of the many last-minute court appointments 
that Adams had made was to name William Marbury a justice of the peace for 
the District of Columbia. But Adams left office before Marbury’s commission was 
delivered, and President Jeff erson and his secretary of state, James Madison, refused to

deliver it. Marbury sued, and in 1803, the Supreme Court, led by John Marshall, issued 
its decision in the case of Marbury v. Madison . 
Marbury v. Madison was a complex decision with far-reaching consequences. 
Marshall began by saying that Jefferson had, indeed, been irresponsible in failing 
to deliver the commission, for even a president “cannot at his discretion sport 
away the vested rights of others.” However, Marshall also said, the Court could do 
nothing because the clause in the Judiciary Act of 1789 giving the federal courts the 
right to issue writs requiring governmental action was unconstitutional because 
the Constitution did not give the judiciary such authority. Th e result of the ruling 
was three-fold. First, Marbury did not get his job. Second, while the Court slapped 
Jeff erson’s wrist, it also gave him the legal victory in the case because he was not forced 
to appoint Marbury, and his party’s overturning of the Judiciary Act of 1801 stood. 
Since Jeff erson had won, there was nothing in the Court decision for him to challenge. 
But third, Marshall also made a point of saying that the Court had the authority to 
declare an act of Congress unconstitutional. It was the fi rst time the Court asserted 
this power of judicial review . Th e Court would not use this power to determine the 
constitutionality of an act of Congress again until 1857, long aft er Marshall was gone, 
but Marshall had dramatically expanded the authority of the federal courts while also 
ensuring that they would not be challenged by Jeff erson or the Republican Congress. 
Rural America and the Agrarian Ideal 
In 1801, the occupations, opinions, and manners of most American voters were 
compatible with Jeff erson’s agrarian ideal of a nation of independent farmers, and they 
provided a solid foundation on which to build political consensus. Th e population of 
the United States when Jeff erson took offi ce was just over 5.3 million, almost 900,000 
of whom were African slaves. Ninety percent of whites lived on farms. 
However, far from being permanently attached to their isolated rural communities, 
many moved oft en, seeking more and better land in Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee. 
Older farms were sold and resold regularly. A French observer, the Duc de La 
Rochefoucauld-Liancourt, visited the United States just before Jeff erson’s inauguration. 
He wondered whether American farmers had any of the French peasant’s attachment to 
a particular piece of land, but when he asked the Americans, they said that such attachments 
represented a lack of pluck. So he wrote, “It is a country in fl ux…that which is 
true today as regards its population, its establishments, its prices, its commerce will not 
be true six months from now.” 
For many in the Republic, all forms of authority, in government and in manners, 
were suspect. Republican virtue was to be found in equality, at least among white men. 
While voting restrictions related to race and gender continued, and even grew in the 
early 1800s, virtually all property qualifications for voting disappeared, and many 
people now wanted to vote. As a result, the number of voters, which had previously 
included around 20 percent of the white male population, expanded in most states to 
70 and 80 percent. Compared to any earlier era, the white male electorate was large. It 
was also opinionated and individualistic. 
European visitors were fascinated and appalled by the manners and morals of 
Americans. An Englishman, Charles William Janson, who lived in the United States 
from 1793 to 1806, called Americans “the only remaining republicans in the civilized 
world,” but he also found them “in every respect uncongenial to English habits, and 
to the tone of an Englishman’s constitution.” Everyone in the United States, Janson 
said, from the poorest and least educated to the most elite, “consider themselves on an 
equal footing with the best educated people in the country.” 
Th e United States of the early 1800s was also a violent place. Political arguments 
were oft en settled with fi sts. Urban riots were not unusual when crowds poured out 
of a tavern, theater, or factory. Observers worried that the country was losing its 
cohesion. Fighting was as common in rural communities. Daniel Drake, who grew

up in Kentucky and became one of the leading citizens of Cincinnati, described his 
childhood home in the early 1800s as a place where men fought with “no hold barred” 
using hands, feet, and teeth and “scratching, pulling hair, choking, gouging out each 
other’s eyes, and biting off each other’s noses.” 
Men of higher social standing oft en settled minor grudges with a duel. Jeff erson’s 
Vice President Aaron Burr, who never forgave his longtime political rival former 
Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton for his role in the fi nal outcome of the 1800 
election, later challenged him to a duel in response to unkind comments Hamilton 
made. Hamilton agreed as a point of honor, and Burr killed him in the resulting fi ght 
in 1804. Long before he became president in 1829, Andrew Jackson was shot in a duel 
over a bet on a horserace in Tennessee in 1806. He carried that bullet in his chest for 
the rest of his life; his opponent was killed in the encounter. 
One cause of the violence was the high level of alcohol consumption. Most 
Americans with access to alcohol—which did not include slaves—enjoyed a drink 
during the colonial era. But in the early 1800s, drinking doubled from an average of 
2.5 gallons per person per year in 1790, to fi ve gallons in 1820. One doctor complained 
that 40 of the 100 physicians in New York City were drunks. Charles Janson reported 
his “horror” at “boys, whose dress indicated wealthy parents, intoxicated, shouting 
and swearing in the public streets.” Another observer estimated that some workers 
were consuming a quart of hard liquor every day. 
Th e violence, lack of manners, and “shouting and swearing” were not limited to 
duels among the elite or fi st fi ghts on the frontier. Interracial violence between white 
Americans and Indians continued long aft er the Indian Wars in the east had ended. 
Individual Indians were easy marks for attack. Similarly, slaves could do little to protect 
themselves against the violence that was always a part of the slave system. Th e 
beating, rape, even killing of slaves was seldom considered a matter of concern for 
anyone but those on the plantation. 
Family life, too, was not exempt from violence. When a New Yorker, Stephen 
Arnold, was tried for the murder of his adopted daughter, many saw it as government 
intrusion into a family matter. But while violence toward wives and children may have 
increased, it was also resisted as it had not been earlier. Divorce rates increased as 
women refused to stay in violent or unhappy marriages or remain legally connected to 
a man who had left them long before. 
During Jeff erson’s time in offi ce, the nation’s capital in Washington, D.C., was little more than a 
sleepy village along the shores of the Potomac River. Jeff erson liked it that way, as a symbol of 
a weak federal government.

Jeff erson the Individual 
While Americans debated the many meanings of freedom and unfreedom in the 
democratic experiment of which they were a part, they also debated the personal 
life of their president and whether he was himself a good example of the 
ideals he espoused. 
While Jeff erson insisted on a simplifi ed social scene at the White House, his life 
at his grand house in Monticello was anything but. At Monticello, he entertained 
lavishly and served the fi nest food and wine, while continually expanding the house 
and the library. Slaves did all of the hard work and took care of the president’s every 
need. Th e defender of republican equality in social relations lived an aristocratic 
private life. 
The president’s private life became national news soon after he took office. 
On September 1, 1802, the Richmond Recorder , edited by James Callendar, a former 
Jefferson ally-turned-enemy, carried a story that began, “It is well known that 
the man, whom it delighteth the people to honor, keeps, and for many years has 
kept, as his concubine, one of his slaves. Her name is SALLY.” Thus did rumors of 
Thomas Jefferson’s longtime relationship with his slave, Sally Hemings, become 
national news. Not everyone believed the story, and Jefferson remained silent, but 
his opponents used the story of his life with Sally Hemings and the birth of their 
children to smear the president. The Federalists made a major issue of the relationship 
when Jefferson ran for reelection in 1804. He still won easily, but the 
rumors persisted long after he died and Hemings’s children were free. With the 
advent of DNA testing in the late 1990s, it has been established as highly likely 
that the children of Sally Hemings, four of whom survived into adulthood and 
were set free, were also the children of Thomas Jefferson. Although not without 
debate, this conclusion is the consensus of most historians who have studied 
Jefferson’s life.

THE IDEAL OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM 
Explain how Americans applied new individualist ideals in their religion and how the 
expansion of faith-based organizations supported, yet also challenged, Jeffersonian 
republicanism. 
On his first New Year’s Day in the White House, Thomas Jefferson wrote to the 
members of a committee of the Danbury, Connecticut, Baptist Association: 
Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between man and 
his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that 
the legislative powers of government reach actions only, and not opinions, 
I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people 
which declared that their legislature should “make no law respecting an establishment 
of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,” thus building a 
wall of separation between Church and State. 
With the wide distribution of that letter, the “ wall of separation between church 
and state ” became part of the American lexicon. Some have pointed out that the 
“wall of separation” is merely a phrase coined by one president and not part of the 
Constitution or law of the land. Th ey are right. But in 1802, Jeff erson was expressing 
another aspect of the republican ideal. More and more Americans believed that two 
of the most important arenas of American life—politics and religion—should stay as 
far away from each other as possible. People who wanted to be treated equally with 
everyone else, no matter what their wealth or family; who wanted to be free to curse, 
drink, and fi ght without the law’s intrusion; and who wanted to be left alone on their 
own farms also wanted to be able to pursue their religious beliefs as they chose. 
A decade before Jeff erson wrote to the Connecticut Baptists, President George 
Washington had written to the Sephardic Jewish congregation in Newport, Rhode 
Island, expressing similar views (see Chapter 7 ) . Like the letter that Washington 
8.2 
wall of separation between church and 
state 
A phrase coined by Thomas Jefferson to make 
clear his belief that the First Amendment to 
the Constitution guaranteed that governments 
should not interfere with the work of 
churches, and churches should not interfere 
with, or expect support from, government. 
As a young man, Jefferson married Martha Wayles Skelton, 
like himself a wealthy young Virginian. Martha Jefferson 
died at Monticello in 1782, and Jefferson never remarried. In 
1787, a 16-year-old slave, Sally Hemings, who was the half-sister 
of Jefferson’s wife Martha by her slave-owning father, became 
a servant in Jefferson’s Paris home while he was ambassador to 
France. When Jefferson returned to the United States in 1789, 
Hemings could have stayed in France and been free by French 
law, but she returned with him. While much is not known about 
their relationship, Jefferson seems to have promised Hemings 
that he would free the children of their union. Hemings and 
many of her family lived at Monticello near the older children 
from Jefferson’s marriage. Sally Hemings’s last child was born 
there in 1808, and Hemings stayed at Jefferson’s home until he 
died in 1826, when she went to live with her own free children. 
In her book, The Hemingses of Monticello: An American Family 
(New York: W. W. Norton, 2008), historian Annette Gordon-Reed 
traces not only the story of Sally Hemings, but the story of the 
intertwined generations of the Jefferson and Hemings families. 
The story raises many questions for historians, including questions 
about the relevance of Jefferson’s personal relationship 
with Sally Hemings in terms of judgments about his political 
career and as president. 
Thinking Critically 
1. Contextualization 
Was it possible for a slave woman and a powerful older free 
man who claimed ownership of her to form a truly consensual 
relationship? Why or why not? 
2. Historical Interpretation 
What bearings might Jefferson’s relationship with Sally 
Hemings have on his complex attitudes about the institution 
of slavery? What does an understanding of Jefferson’s family 
with Sally Hemings and her family tell us about the nature of 
American slavery and society in the early 1800s?

wrote, Jeff erson’s letter was written to a specifi c audience, but unlike Washington, 
Jeff erson sought a change in government policy—specifi cally state government policy 
in New England. 
In 1802, when he wrote the letter, Connecticut was one of four states that still 
had an official, state-supported church, a so-called “ religious establishment .” 
Connecticut required all of its citizens, including its Baptists and nonbelievers, to 
pay taxes to support the state’s Congregational churches, as did New Hampshire and 
Massachusetts. Maryland required support for the Episcopal Church. When it was 
adopted in 1791, the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, indeed all of the Bill 
of Rights amendments, applied only to the federal government. States could do as they 
pleased in church-state matters. Only aft er the Civil War was the reach of the Bill of 
Rights broadened. Long before the Revolution, all of the states had stopped requiring 
church attendance or prosecuting people for heresy, but the clergy in the four states of 
Connecticut, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and Maryland were still civil servants 
supported by the state government. Some of the governed, including Connecticut’s 
Baptists and Maryland’s Catholics, resented paying a tax that benefi ted other religious 
bodies but not their own. So in the 1802 letter, Jeff erson was telling these Connecticut 
Baptists just what they wanted to hear. Not surprisingly, some of the Congregational 
leaders in Connecticut did not agree. 
The Separation of Church and State at the State Level 
Jeff erson, along with James Madison, had convinced the Virginia legislature to end 
public fi nancial support for the Episcopal Church in that state in 1786, 5 years before 
Madison helped shepherd the First Amendment through Congress. Th at victory had 
not been an easy one. 
Th e fi ercest battle over state support for specifi c churches, however, was fought 
in Connecticut. Timothy Dwight, who became president of Yale in 1795, was a fi rm 
Federalist who hated Jefferson’s republicanism and who could not imagine good 
government or moral citizens without a state church. One of Dwight’s students at 
Yale, Lyman Beecher, organized the Connecticut Society for the Suppression of 
Vice and the Promotion of Good Morals and published Th e Connecticut Evangelical 
Magazine and Religious Intelligencer in an eff ort to maintain the special status of the 
Congregationalist churches. But he lost. In 1817, Oliver Wolcott, who opposed a statesupported 
church in Connecticut, defeated a Federalist for governor, and Connecticut 
would end its state support for all religious bodies. Beecher was heartbroken. Years 
later, however, he changed his mind: 
Th e injury done to the cause of Christ, as we then supposed, was irreparable. 
For several days I suff ered what no tongue can tell for the best thing that ever 
happened to the State of Connecticut….By voluntary eff orts, societies, missions, 
and revivals, they [clergy] exert a deeper infl uence than ever they could 
by queues, and shoe-buckles, and cocked hats, and gold-headed canes. 
Religion in Connecticut, as Beecher noted, actually survived and fl ourished without 
state support and, not long aft erward, Massachusetts, the last holdout, followed the 
same path to separate church and state. 
New Religious Expressions 
Direct government support for churches disappeared in the early 1800s, but the importance 
of religious freedom did not. Th e ideals of individual freedom in all areas of life 
generated an amazing growth in religious organizations and ideas in the same era. 
Church attendance in America dropped during and aft er the Revolution. Many of 
the elite, like Jeff erson, were deists who saw God as, at most, a distant force in human 
aff airs; many working people ignored religious matters altogether. During Jeff erson’s 
presidency, however, Americans participated in an outpouring of evangelical 
religious establishment

8.3 
Christianity—the beginning of the Second Great Awakening . Th is religious revival 
paralleled and, indeed, exceeded the Great Awakening of the 1740s that had transformed 
American Christianity. Although major developments of the Second Great 
Awakening occurred largely in the 1820s and 1830s, the movement began in the late 
1790s and the early 1800s. 
Cane Ridge and the Revivals of the Early 1800s 
In 1796, a Presbyterian minister named James McGready moved from the Carolinas 
to Kentucky. Most of those who had moved across the Appalachian Mountains 
into Kentucky had left their religion at home, if they ever had any at all. McGready 
described “Rogue’s Harbor” in Logan County, Kentucky, as a place of horse thieves, 
murderers, robbers, counterfeiters, and runaways. Th ey were the same people whom 
Daniel Drake had described as fi ghting with “no holds barred.” McGready set out to 
make them good church-going Christians. He was surprisingly successful. In 1799, he 
and other preachers held a church service at the Gaspar River Meeting House. John 
McGee, one of the others involved, remembered, “I left the pulpit and went through 
the audience shouting and exhorting with all possible ecstasy and energy, and the fl oor 
was soon covered with the slain.” (Revivalist preachers oft en called those who experienced 
emotional conversion “the slain” because they were seen as having died to their 
old, sinful lives.) 
Th e revival of 1799 led to more religious gatherings, and they grew so big that they 
needed to be held at outdoor campgrounds. In one of the largest religious gatherings 
before the Civil War, perhaps 20,000 people—10 percent of the state’s population— 
gathered at Cane Ridge in Bourbon County, Kentucky, for a 5-day camp meeting in 
August 1801 that was led by Presbyterian and Methodist ministers. Preaching continued 
from dawn to midnight with little time for meals or rest. James Finley, who was 
himself converted to Christianity at the Cane Ridge Camp Meeting and went on to a 
long career as a frontier revivalist, described the days: 
I counted seven ministers all preaching at once, some on stumps, others in 
wagons, and one…was standing on a tree trunk which had, in falling, lodged 
against another. Some of the people were singing, others praying, some crying. 
Barton W. Stone, the pastor of the Cane Ridge Presbyterian 
Church that hosted the gathering, remembered, “Many things 
transpired there, which were so much like miracles, that if they 
were not, they had the same effect as miracles on infidels and 
unbelievers.” 
Methodists, Baptists, and Other Protestants 
Although Cane Ridge was a joint Presbyterian-Methodist 
endeavor, it was the Methodists and Baptists who grew the most 
from the revival movement. Indeed, the revivals that began 
in the early 1800s made these two denominations the largest 
Protestant groups in the country during that time. 
Methodism had come to America through John Wesley 
(1703–1791), who founded the Methodist movement in 
England along with his brother, Charles, the hymn writer 
(1707–1788). John Wesley had also preached in Georgia. But 
it was the fi rst American Methodist Bishop, Francis Asbury (1745–1816), who established 
American Methodism. Asbury created a new form of Protestant ministry, the 
Methodist circuit riders, who moved from community to community preaching with 
great fervor and organizing churches at every stop.

John Wesley believed that it was in the power of every person to decide whether 
they wanted to experience salvation. His emphasis on the need for free individuals to 
make their own decisions appealed in freedom-loving Jeff ersonian America. In addition, 
Wesley’s experience of having his “heart strangely warmed” allowed a level of 
emotionalism in Methodism that was lacking in other denominations. 
Baptists had been in North America for almost as long as the Puritans. Th ey were 
the largest religious body in Rhode Island, where they founded Brown University. 
The Baptists of the Second Great Awakening, however, were a different breed 
from their earlier, New England Baptist counterparts. Th eir religious events were 
more emotional, and they were more individualistic and determined to assert local 
authority. 
Where Methodism was tightly organized from bishops to preachers to congregations, 
Baptist organization was highly decentralized, with each congregation 
retaining total control. While Methodists were largely united until the coming of 
the Civil War, Baptists tended to splinter into rival groups—Regular Baptists, Anti- 
Mission Baptists, Freewill Baptists, Church of God Baptists, Seventh-Day Baptists, 
Six-Principle Baptists, Hard Shell Baptists. Th e model Methodist minister was the 
circuit rider; the typical Baptist minister was a farmer-preacher who grew up in a 
particular congregation and was selected to lead it while he continued to support 
himself by his own labor. Despite their diff erences, however, both the Methodist 
and the Baptist ministers were highly eff ective in changing the religious outlook of 
the country aft er 1800. 
Faith in the Slave Quarters and Free Black Churches 
White communities were not the only ones experiencing a revival of religion in the 
early 1800s. At revivals like Cane Ridge, blacks and whites, whether slaves or free people, 
mixed with surprising freedom. Revivals in some parts of the South, especially 
in the early 1800s, were seen as a kind of holiday, and many of the rules of daily life, 
including racial segregation, were suspended. 
Many plantation owners organized religious services for slaves that focused 
on the virtues of submission and obedience. But slaves passed along memories 
of another form of worship—congregations that met, oft en at night in secluded 
places. Th e scholar and activist W.E.B. Dubois (1868–1963) described the meetings 
of these clandestine congregations as occasions to speak of “the longing and 
disappointment and resentment of a stolen people” and about their deep passion 
for liberty. 
Litt Young, a slave on a plantation near Vicksburg, Mississippi, remembered that 
the mistress of the plantation 
built a nice church with glass windows and a brass cupola for the blacks. A 
yellow man [a light-skinned African-American] preached to us. She had him 
preach how we was to obey our master and missy if we want to go to heaven, 
but when she wasn’t there, he come out with straight preachin’ from the Bible. 
Clara Young recalled her favorite preacher was a man named Matthew Ewing who, 
even though he could not read or write, “sure knowed his Bible.” For these slaves, 
eff ective preaching involved knowing the Bible, either by memory or from the rare— 
and illegal—ability to read it, and an ability to preach with passion about freedom in 
the next life and quite possibly in this life. Worship included singing, dancing, and a 
cathartic emotional release and renewal. 
Any unsupervised meeting of slaves frightened whites. Denmark Vesey, a free 
black Sunday school teacher who saw himself as a latter-day Moses, ready to lead his 
people to freedom, led a slave revolt in South Carolina in 1822. In 1831, Nat Turner 
would lead the largest slave revolt before the Civil War. When Turner told the 
8.1

8.4 
authorities that he knew he “was ordained for some great purpose in the hands of the 
Almighty,” and that “the great day of judgment was at hand,” he confi rmed what they 
had been fearing about slave religion. 
Th e longing for freedom usually took less violent paths, however. Slavery depended 
on hopelessness, and religion gave slaves hope that could lead to resistance. Th e songs 
of the slave quarter are oft en songs of freedom. Th us slaves sang: 
Steal away, steal away, steal away to Jesus! 
Steal away, steal away home, I ain’t got long to stay here! 
Sometimes these lyrics meant stealing away to the religious meeting, but they 
could also mean stealing away from slavery to fl ee North. 
At the same time, northern free blacks began to form their own religious organizations. 
Richard Allen was born a slave in Delaware. He converted to Methodism 
and was able to purchase his freedom and begin preaching. Although Allen preached 
to white and black congregations, he “soon saw a large field open in seeking and 
instructing my African brethren, who had been a long forgotten people and few of 
them attended public worship.” 
Because white churches were not always welcoming, Allen became convinced 
that a racially integrated congregation was impossible. In response, he organized 
the Bethel Church in Philadelphia in 1794. Thus was born the African Methodist 
Episcopal Church, which by 1820 had 4,000 members in Philadelphia and 2,000 more 
in Baltimore. Other black Methodists founded the African Methodist Episcopal Zion 
Church in New York. African-American Baptists also created their own congregations. 
Fears of religiously inspired slave rebellions, especially aft er Denmark Vesey’s 
rebellion of 1822, led southern governments to block the growth of independent black 
churches, but in the North, free black churches thrived as their members exercised 
leadership, developed their own ideas, and worshipped among themselves. 
American Catholic and Jewish Communities 
In the early years of the Republic, there were few Roman Catholics or Jews in the 
areas of the original 13 colonies. During the late 1700s and early 1800s, the largest 
number of Catholics in North America lived in New Orleans, which had become 
part of the United States only in 1803, and in Texas, New Mexico, and California, 
which were still part of Mexico until the 1840s. Nearly all white immigrants to the 
British colonies had been at least nominally Protestant, except for Catholics who had 
been granted safe haven in Maryland. Religious freedom in the Jeff ersonian era was 
tremendously important to those who were in the smallest minorities. Th e freedom 
to form their own religious organizations, free of government control and oft en free 
of full authority by their own senior leaders, was important to Catholics and Jews in 
Jeff ersonian America. 
In 1790, John Carroll was appointed the fi rst Catholic bishop in America. He was 
based in Maryland, where Catholics, having lost their right to govern the colony, had 
again gained religious freedom aft er the Revolution (see Chapter 7 ) . Carroll was later 
promoted to Archbishop of Baltimore when the Vatican appointed bishops for Boston, 
New York, and Bardstown, Kentucky. Carroll worked hard to build Catholic strength 
and to fi t into the democratic spirit of America. He established the fi rst American 
Catholic college at Georgetown, Maryland (later part of the District of Columbia), and 
a Catholic seminary at Baltimore. In many places, Catholic laypeople created their 
own churches, appointed themselves trustees, and when possible hired their own 
priests. Vatican responses to the radical secularism of the French Revolution led to 
pressure on Carroll to curtail this trend among the American laity and, instead, agree

to the hierarchical appointment of priests, but throughout the early 1800s, American 
Catholicism had remarkably strong lay leadership. 
At the time of the Revolution, most of the few American Jews lived in East Coast 
cities such as Newport, Philadelphia, and New York City. Between then and 1820, new 
congregations and synagogues were formed in Richmond, New Orleans, Cincinnati, 
and Baltimore. Jewish religious communities, like those of Catholics and Protestants, 
took on republican sentiments. In New York City, Congregation Shearith Israel 
adopted the words “Whereas in free states all power originates and is derived from the 
people” as the beginning words to their new congregational constitution. 
Quick Review How does this trend toward religious freedom epitomize the republican 
values of the Jefferson administration? 
BEYOND THE MISSISSIPPI: THE LOUISIANA PURCHASE AND THE 
EXPEDITION OF LEWIS AND CLARK 
Explain what effects the Louisiana Purchase and the westward expansion had on how 
Americans saw themselves. 
Jeff erson was a political philosopher committed to a small federal government and 
religious freedom, but he was also a pragmatic politician. One of the practical issues 
that he faced in leading a country of independent farmers was that those farmers living 
in western regions were not happy. 
Geography shaped American politics at the beginning of Jeff erson’s term in offi ce. 
Before the advent of railroads, farmers west of the Alleghenies found it very diffi cult 
to ship their goods over the mountains to the Atlantic coast or transport them down 
the Mississippi through New Orleans. Th ese diffi culties had helped fuel the Whiskey 
Rebellion and the short-lived effort to make Kentucky the independent nation of 
Franklin during Washington’s administration (see Chapter 7 ) , and Jeff erson worried 
that frustrated frontier farmers might still seek to form an independent country, as 
some of them advocated to do. He also worried about European infl uence still among 
them and knew that having many unhappy citizens was not good for the future of a 
sitting president. He was determined to do something about it. 
French explorers were the first Europeans to reach and settle the banks of the 
Mississippi River, and most European influences in the region were still French, 
refl ected in French place names from Detroit to Saint Louis to New Orleans. However, 
at the close of the French and Indian War in 1763, France ceded to Spain the area west 
of the Mississippi and the city of New Orleans. Th roughout the Washington and Adams 
administrations and into Jeff erson’s, in spite of the provisions of the Pinckney Treaty, 
Spain periodically restricted non-Spanish vessels from sailing on the Mississippi and 
collected customs duties on all goods moving through New Orleans. Th at practice was 
detrimental because more than half of all the goods shipped out of the United States 
were shipped down the Mississippi River and through the port of New Orleans, not 
Atlantic ports. By 1800, Spain had become weaker, prompting Jeff erson to write that 
Spanish control of the river and New Orleans “would hardly be felt by us.” 
However, Napoleon Bonaparte, who now ruled France, negotiated a secret treaty 
with Spain to return New Orleans and the entire Louisiana Territory to France. When 
word of the treaty reached the United States in 1802, it provoked a crisis. Jeff erson 
believed that for France, then the strongest nation in Europe, to control American 
commerce was intolerable. The president told the American ambassador in Paris, 
8.3 
8.2 

240 Part IV Crafting a Nation, People, Land, and a National Identity, 1800–1848 
8.5 
8.4 
“There is on the globe one single spot, the possessor of which is our natural and 
habitual enemy.” Th at spot was New Orleans. 
The Louisiana Purchase 
Th e solution for more secure commerce, Jeff erson thought, was to buy the city of New 
Orleans from France. Once the port was under American control, Jeff erson was confi - 
dent that he would have solved a long-term problem for his western constituents and 
won an important political victory. Jeff erson dispatched two of his most trusted associates, 
James Monroe and Robert Livingston, to Paris to off er $6 million for the city. If 
they could not reach an accommodation with the French, Monroe was to proceed to 
London and try to make an alliance against France with Great Britain. 
While Jeff erson worried about control of New Orleans, Napoleon had worries of 
his own. Although he was victorious on the European continent, Napoleon needed 
money. In addition, French eff orts to put down the slave uprising in Haiti had gone 
terribly. Militant slave resistance and yellow fever had killed 24,000 French soldiers, 
and Haitian independence seemed inevitable. New Orleans and the Mississippi Valley, 
which supplied Haiti with food and raw materials, would become much less important 
to France if France no longer controlled the Haitian sugar and coff ee plantations. So 
when the Americans off ered $6 million for one city, Napoleon’s government off ered 
to sell the whole middle third of the present-day United States for $15 million. 
Jeff erson was thrilled with Napoleon’s off er. He worried, however, that a strict reading 
of the Constitution did not authorize the federal government to make such a huge purchase 
of land; it certainly did not mention that authority in the powers granted to the national 
government. Nevertheless, the practical political benefits of the Louisiana Purchase 
overcame his constitutional doubts. Some Federalists in Congress opposed the purchase, 
fearing—correctly—that the infl uence of New England—the last Federalist region of the 
country—would be diminished in a vastly larger nation. But most Americans, even most 
Federalists, were enthusiastic. Congress acted quickly, and the treaty confi rming the transfer 
of 828,000 square miles from nominal French control to the United States was easily 
ratifi ed. Th e United States had solved the problem of New Orleans and secured control 
of both sides of the Mississippi River from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico, while 
almost doubling the nation’s land area. How to incorporate this land into the United States, 
whether as states or territories, would be left for future administrations to determine. 
The City of New Orleans 
New Orleans was unusual for an American city when it became part of the United 
States in 1803. Many of its inhabitants spoke French or Spanish, but they now lived in a 
country where business was conducted in English. It was a Catholic city that was now 
part of an overwhelmingly Protestant country. Its citizens were a cosmopolitan mix 
with attitudes toward many things—including race and sexuality—that were diff erent 
from those of most Americans. 
Slavery in Spanish and French colonies varied widely. Some of the harshest slavery 
in the world was in the sugar plantations of French Haiti and in Spanish Cuba. 
But slaves in cities like Havana and pre-1803 New Orleans could maintain stable 
families, enjoy their own holidays, and earn money to buy goods for themselves and, 
sometimes, even their freedom. In New Orleans, slaves and free blacks could gather 
at Congo Square on Sundays to dance, play drums, and sing in their own languages 
under the watchful eye of whites but with a freedom of action unimaginable elsewhere 
in the United States. Th e music that they brought from Africa and developed in New 
Orleans was the foundation of American jazz music. 
There was also considerable racial mixing in New Orleans. Mixed-race people 
faced discrimination, but many black women nonetheless became long-term partners 
to white men. Indeed, such unions were an avenue of upward mobility for some black

women, not only in New Orleans but also in many of the Spanish and French colonies 
in ways that were not true in British colonies or in the United States. Th at African 
women could maintain their own gardens, buy and sell goods, and be involved in intimate 
relationships with white men led to complex family negotiations. A libre (as free 
blacks were called) woman, Carlota d’Erneville, purchased her freedom in 1773 and 
the freedom of her son Carlos in 1775. She later became rich enough to own her own 
tavern and houses that she rented to others. 
Th e New Orleans that Jeff erson purchased in 1803 had a population of 8,000 with 
their own churches, dance halls, theater, newspapers, and police force. One-third of all 
people of African origin in the city were free compared with less than two percent in 
nearby Kentucky or Tennessee and under 10 percent in the United States as a whole. 
Many of the French-speaking women and men of New Orleans, black or white, 
slave or free, tended to refer to any citizens of the United States as “Kaintucks” or 
Kentuckians—no matter where in the United States they came from. Kaintucks were 
the tough backwoods farmers and slaves who crewed flatboats. These large floating 
raft s, oft en 15 feet wide by 50- to 80-feet long, carried up to 100 tons of grain. For the 
Americans who came down the Mississippi on a fl atboat, New Orleans was a city of 
pleasure that lured many to stay and create a new American population. Although the 
racial and cultural diversity of New Orleans frightened some Americans, its essential 
geographic location made it the prize of the Louisiana Purchase. 
The Lewis and Clark Expedition 
Jeff erson wanted to assert American dominance in North America. In 1803, before he 
even knew the outcome of the Monroe-Livingston negotiations for New Orleans that 
he had authorized, he asked Congress to support a “scientifi c expedition” to study the 
people, lands, and animal and plant species of the North American continent across 
the Louisiana territory and on to the Pacifi c Ocean. While he wanted the scientifi c 
information, Jeff erson was even more interested in a full report on Spanish and French 
military power in the region. Th e expedition was to be led by his private secretary, 
Meriwether Lewis, and an army offi cer, William Clark. Before Lewis and Clark could 
depart, word came of the Louisiana Purchase. Suddenly, the United States owned 
much of the land the expedition was authorized to explore. Th e news changed nothing; 
the order still stood: learn as much as possible about the new American lands and 
the places beyond them, and make treaties with as many of the original inhabitants as 
possible. It was a daunting assignment that would become one of American history’s 
most celebrated exploits. 
Lewis and Clark and their Corps of Discovery —the team of soldiers, civilian 
woodsmen, boatmen, interpreters, and Clark’s slave York—prepared for the trip during 
the winter of 1803–04 in St. Louis on the west bank of the Mississippi River. Th e site was 
a Spanish/French trading post of about a thousand people, which was a gateway to the 
territory the United States had just acquired. French explorers were familiar with much 
of the land over which the expedition would travel, as was a British trader, Alexander 
Mackenzie, who had been the first European to cross North America in 1792–93. 
Of course, the Indians living along the route knew their homelands well. Still, for 
Americans, this vast area was unknown land. On May 14, 1804, the Corps of Discovery 
left Camp River Dubois in Hartford, Illinois, to travel up the Missouri River into the 
heart of the Louisiana Territory. By the end of October, they reached an area close to the 
current U.S.-Canadian border in North Dakota. Th ere, near a Mandan Indian village on 
the Missouri River, they made camp for the winter. Th e Mandans lived in earth lodges 
in settled villages. Th ey had traded with the French for over a hundred years, had been 
decimated by European smallpox, and knew European ways, but the arrival of the Lewis 
and Clark expedition was their fi rst contact with Americans. Th e Americans traded 
goods and celebrated feasts, including New Year’s Day, with the Mandans, drinking, 
dancing, and playing the fi ddle to the surprise of their hosts.

Critical to the success of the corps were French trapper Toussaint Charbonneau 
and his Shoshone partner Sacagawea, who joined the expedition with their newborn 
child. Whether Sacagawea was the slave or the wife of Charbonneau is unclear, but 
she became an essential guide and an American legend. Sacagawea began as a cook 
and laundress for the corps while she carried her baby on her back but quickly used 
her knowledge of the countryside to fi nd food and translate with some of the tribes 
they met. At the end of their journey, Lewis and Clark paid Charbonneau $500 for 
his services, but later they wondered whether they should have paid Sacagawea, too. 
According to unverifi ed Shoshone tradition, Sacagawea lived to an old age, dying at 
the Wind River Indian Reservation in 1884. 
As they tried to cross the Rocky Mountains in September of 1805, the corps moved 
beyond the rather inexact western boundary of the Louisiana Purchase into Oregon 
Country that was claimed by Britain, Russia, and Spain, but not the United States. 
As instructed by Jeff erson, they kept going, and almost starved. Th ey had assumed 
that the Rocky Mountains were like the Appalachians. Th ey crossed through a valley 
expecting to see downward slopes, but instead, Clarke noted in his journal, they faced 
higher mountains “in every direction as far as I could see.” At Weippe Prairie in what 
is now Idaho, they stumbled into a party of Nez Perce Indians, by far the largest tribe 
in that part of the western Rockies, who brought them to a “large spacious lodge” and 
fed them. An Indian leader known as Twisted Hair drew a map of the river system 
leading to the Columbia River and the Pacifi c coast and taught the Americans how to 
make dugout canoes out of pine. Th e food saved the explorers lives, and the canoes 
saved the trip. 
On November 24, 1805, the Corps of Discovery left their horses with Twisted 
Hair and, following the route he mapped for them, reached the Pacifi c Ocean. Th ey 
built Fort Clatsop near present-day Astoria, Oregon, and wintered there until March 
23, 1806, when they began the long, arduous journey home, reaching Saint Louis 
on September 23, 1806 (see Map 8-1 ). Word spread quickly to the nation and to 
Jeff erson at the White House that the party, whom many had given up for lost, had 
made it back.

While Lewis and Clark were exploring the northern parts of the Louisiana Purchase 
and the Oregon coast, Jeff erson launched other expeditions. Zebulon Pike led an expedition 
that departed from St. Louis in the fall of 1805 to explore the Mississippi and Arkansas 
Rivers and much of the present-day state of Colorado. In 1806, Jeff erson appointed a 
third expedition led by Th omas Freeman, an astronomer and surveyor, to track the Red 
River Valley in the southern portion of the new territory. Th e reports from these expeditions 
opened the way for other adventurers and traders, some of whom, like New York’s 
John Jacob Astor, made a fortune in the fur trade. Th e result for the Mandans, Nez Perce, 
and other tribes was far too oft en disease, war, and the loss of lands and a way of life.

The rescue of the Lewis and Clark expedition by the Nez Perce in 
September 1805 was critical to the success of the expedition. But 
the explanation for why the Nez Perce were so friendly depends on 
who was describing the event. For William Clark, it was an appropriate 
response to his gifts and skill as a negotiator. For the Nez Perce, it was a 
response to a much earlier Nez Perce tradition. 
From the Journals of Lewis and Clark Red Bear 
September 20—I Set out early and…decended the mountain to a 
leavel pine Countrey proceeded on through a butifull Countrey for 
three miles to a Small Plain in which I found maney Indian lodges, 
at the distance of 1 mile from the lodges I met 3 boys, when they 
Saw me ran and hid themselves searched…found gave them Small 
pieces of ribin & Sent them forward to the village a man Came out 
to meet me with great Caution and Conducted me [us] to a large 
Spacious Lodge which he told me (by Signs) was the Lodge of his 
great Chief…great numbers of women gathered around me with 
much apparent Signs of fear, and apr. pleased they (those people) 
gave us a Small piece of Buff alow meat, Some dried Salmon beries 
& roots in diff erent States, Some round and much like an onion 
which they call (Pas she co) quamash the Bread or Cake is called 
Pas-she-co Sweet, of this they make bread & Supe they also gave 
us the bread made of this root all of which we eate hartily, I gave 
them a fi ew Small articles as preasents, and proceeded on with 
a Chief to his Village 2 miles in the Same Plain, where we were 
treated kindly in their way and continued with them all night. 
Those two Villages consist of about 30 double lodges, but fi ew 
men a number of women & children; They call themselves Cho 
pun-nish or Pierced Noses ; their dialect appears very diff erent from 
the (fl at heads) Tushapaws (I have seen). 
[From an oral history recorded in 1926 with Red Bear’s grandson] 
Chief Red Bear fi rst learned of white people through a girl of his 
band living on Tamonmo [the Salmon River]. When small she was 
stolen by the Blacklegs in the buff alo country, who sold her to 
some tribe farther toward the sunrise. In time she was bought by 
white people, probably in Canada, where she was well treated. It 
is a long story; how in time, carrying her little baby, she ran away 
and after several moons reached the friendly Selish, who cared 
for her and brought her in a dying condition to her own people 
at White Bird. Her baby had died on the way. She was called 
Watkuweis [Returned from a Faraway Country]. 
She told of the white people, how good they had been to her, and 
how well she liked them. When the fi rst two white men, Lewis and 
Clark with their followers, came Watkuweis said to her people, 
“These are the people who helped me! Do them no hurt!” 
This was why the strange people had been received in friendship. 
There had been a prophecy about Red Bear and a new people, which 
was thus fulfi lled in 1805. He met the strangers. They fi rst have a 
smoke. If no smoke, then they must fi ght. Red Bear made presents of 
dressed buckskins, and they gave him beads and a few other articles. 
They afterwards found the white man’s gifts to be cheap.

THE WAR OF 1812 
Analyze the causes and impact of the War of 1812. 
Jeff erson expanded the United States, but he had been able to do little about the British 
and French navies that threatened the country as a result of confl icts between the two 
European powers. Th e actions Jeff erson took to protect the United States on the seas actually 
hurt the country economically. What had begun as an irritating concern to Jeff erson 
escalated into the War of 1812 during the presidency of his successor James Madison. 
Th at confl ict, which continued from 1812 to 1815, deserves more attention than it 
oft en receives from historians. Th e war resolved issues that had limited U.S. development 
for decades, and its conclusion launched a new period of growth for the country. 
It was the last war ever fought between the United States and Great Britain. Th e 
two nations had been in confl ict almost nonstop since 1775, but the end of this war 
brought real peace. It was also the last war in which Indian tribes were allied with 
one nation or against another. Aft er the war, no tribe was ever again able to make an 
alliance with a foreign nation, and the U.S. government treated the tribes less and less 
as sovereign nations and more as an “internal matter.” 
Renewed Tension Between the United States and Great Britain 
The tensions that led the United States and Great Britain to go to war in 1812 had 
existed since the battles of Lexington and Concord in 1775. Despite treaties, the two 
nations were never fully at peace, and each made alliances with Indian tribes to make 
trouble for the other. 
For the British, troubles in North America were a sideshow to a world war with 
France that had begun in 1689 and continued, with brief pauses, until 1815. English 
colonists fought on the British side until the French and Indian War ended in 1763. 
In 1778, France had come to the aid—decisive aid—of the American colonists in 
the Revolution. With the coming of the French Revolution in 1789 and the rise of 
Napoleon in 1799, the war between Britain and France took on a deeper ideological 
tone. While earlier wars had primarily been territorial disputes, aft er their Revolution, 
the French saw themselves as the agents of democracy against a despotic coalition led 
by Britain. Especially aft er the rise of Napoleon, the British saw themselves as defenders 
of the free world against Napoleonic tyranny. In the United States, the greatest 
divide between the emerging political parties was the Federalist tilt toward Britain and 
the Democratic-Republican tilt toward France. By early 1806, Napoleon’s armies controlled 
most of the European continent while the British Royal Navy controlled the 
oceans. For the United States, British control of the seas was a much larger threat than 
worries about who controlled the European continent. 
With Britain and France each casting itself as the defender of freedom while fi ghting 
for national preservation, the war was intense. To survive, Britain depended on its 
navy to protect the island nation from invasion and to dominate the oceans. But the 
Royal Navy was always short of sailors, and one of the reasons for the shortage was the 
tendency of British sailors to desert and join the crew of a U.S. merchant vessel where 
the working conditions were better and the pay up to fi ve times higher. Th e British 
regularly stopped U.S. merchant vessels and occasionally warships on the high seas, in 
violation of international law, to search for their own sailors and, all too oft en, also to 
force any able-bodied seaman, British or American, into service. 
Th is policy of seizing sailors, or impressment, was seen as vital to Britain, but it 
was a direct threat to American freedom and to the economic survival of the United 
States. Impressments had long infuriated Americans and, in fact, had helped spark the 
Revolution in 1776 (see Chapter 5 ) . Between 1803 and 1812, 3,000–6,000 American 
citizens were pressed into service on British warships against their will, many of whom 
never returned. Th e practice was an assault on individual liberties that challenged

everything the American Revolution stood for. A major crisis erupted in June 1807 
when the Royal Navy’s HMS Leopard opened fire on the USS Chesapeake after its 
commander refused to let British offi cers board the ship to look for deserters. Th ree 
American sailors were killed in the fi ghting, and the British then took four sailors 
off the Chesapeake who were either deserters from their navy or Americans resisting 
impressments. President Jeff erson wrote, “Th is country has never been in such a state 
of excitement since the battle of Lexington.” 
Jeff erson and Congress, however, knew that the United States was too weak for a 
fi ght, in part, because of the cutbacks Jeff erson had authorized in the navy and army 
that Adams had previously built up. Congress initially passed a Non-Importation 
Act, hoping that boycotting British goods would be an eff ective strategy, but it failed 
to have an eff ect. Consequently, Jeff erson urged the Embargo Act , which Congress 
passed in December 1807, preventing U.S. trade with any foreign ports to keep ships 
and sailors “out of harm’s way.” Th e president was confi dent that the major impact 
would be on Britain, which he thought could not survive without American foodstuff 
s, and that the American people would be willing to suff er short-term loss to gain 
peace. He was wrong on both counts. British warehouses were full, the country was 
having a good harvest, other nations were willing to sell food, and they could wait out 
the Americans. Most Americans were anxious to maintain the income that commerce 
provided. New England shipping was devastated, and farmers in all of the states lost 
money as cotton, grain, and tobacco piled up and could not be shipped. Smugglers 
became active, by land, across the border between New England and Canada, and by 
sea, eluding the small U.S. Navy that tried to enforce the embargo. Th e Massachusetts 
and Connecticut legislatures, following the precedent of Jefferson’s own earlier 
Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions, declared the embargo illegal in their states, thus 
setting up talk of secession or civil war. 
As a compromise that was meant to appease New England merchants, Congress 
replaced the embargo with the Non-Intercourse Act in 1809, just days before 
Jeff erson left offi ce. Th e new act authorized trade with everyone except Britain and 
France. (France had plundered U.S. ships for supplies during their war with Britain.) 
During Madison’s fi rst term as president, tension continued to grow between the 
United States and Great Britain. In 1810, a further modifi cation of the Non-Intercourse 
Act, known as Macon’s Bill No. 2, created new tensions, especially between the United 
States and Britain. British impressments of U.S. sailors continued unabated while each 
new act continued to hurt commercial ties between the two countries. 
Renewed Tension Between Whites and Indians 
While tensions mounted between the United States and Great Britain, warfare 
between the United States and Indian tribes broke out in the Ohio country. After 
the U.S. Army’s victory at the Battle of Fallen Timbers and the subsequent Treaty 
of Greeneville in 1795, the Old Northwest had been at peace. But a new generation 
of Indians was much less willing to live with what they saw as an unfair treaty. A 
new tribal alliance led by a charismatic religious fi gure named Tenskwatawa, or the 
Prophet, and his half-brother, the military leader Tecumseh, frightened white settlers 
and seriously challenged the small U.S. Army. Many correctly deduced that Tecumseh 
and Tenskwatawa were aided by the British. 
Aft er their losses from the Treaty of Greenville in 1795, many Shawnees came to 
believe that their sorry state was due to their having displeased Waashaa Monetoo, the 
Good Spirit, who, their traditions said, had recreated the world aft er its destruction by 
a fl ood. In the early 1800s, a spiritual leader, Tenskwatawa, told the tribes that their 
dependence on white culture was the source of the Good Spirit’s unhappiness. Aft er 
200 years of coexistence, tribes like the Shawnees had become dependent on European 
muskets, wore cotton clothing, cooked in European cookware, and even lived in 
European-style houses. Tenskwatawa promised that, if his people would renounce

European ways and goods, they could renew their culture and drive whites out of their 
country. He created a new settlement at what is now West Lafayette, Indiana, called 
Prophetstown, where Shawnees and other tribes gathered for spiritual renewal. 
While Tenskwatawa preached, Tecumseh prepared for war. Tenskwatawa was a 
religiously inspired leader, Tecumseh an inspired military tactician. White colonists 
had killed their father Pukeshinwau at the beginning of the American Revolution. 
Th e brothers had seen whites make and break treaty aft er treaty. Tecumseh traveled 
throughout the Ohio territory and sought help from British authorities in Canada 
who, he remembered, had sought to exclude whites from the Ohio region before the 
American Revolution. Tecumseh traveled as far south as Tennessee and Alabama to 
recruit Cherokees, Choctaws, and Creeks. In a meeting with Choctaw and Chickasaw 
leaders in the spring of 1811, Tecumseh (speaking in the Shawnee language) said: 
Th e whites are already a match for us all united, and too strong for any one 
tribe alone to resist; so that unless we support one another with our collective 
and united forces; unless every tribe unanimously combines to give check to 
the ambition and avarice of the whites, they will soon conquer us apart and 
disunited and we will be driven away from our native country and scattered as 
autumnal leaves before the wind. 
Tecumseh was willing to negotiate with the United States, but his goal was an 
all-Indian alliance to drive all whites from the land south of Canada and from between 
the Alleghenies and the Mississippi. 
Whites on the frontier were frightened. In September 1807, Th omas Kirker, the 
acting governor of the new state of Ohio, met with Tecumseh, and the two agreed 
to peace. But in November 1811, while Tecumseh was away seeking Cherokee allies, 
William Henry Harrison, governor of the Indiana Territory, attacked Prophetstown 
with 1,000 U.S. troops. Harrison’s troops burned the village to the ground, though

Two Shawnee leaders and half-brothers—Tecumseh, who led a diverse Indian military alliance, and 
Tenskwatawa, known as The Prophet—proposed a revival of Native American religion in opposition to 
white expansion. 

Chapter 8 Creating a New People, Expanding the Country 247 
the Prophet and most residents escaped. A year later, when the United States went to 
war with Great Britain, Tecumseh, strengthened by support from the British who had 
never stopped stirring up Indian opposition to the United States, led his tribal confederation 
in an all-out war on the Americans. With the United States and Britain formally 
at war, the Shawnee alliance with Britain was a major threat to the Americans. 
War and Its Consequences 
As hostilities grew between the United States and Great Britain and its Indian allies, 
some in Congress, known as the War Hawks , saw a war with Britain as just what the 
country needed. Republicans, led by Henry Clay of Kentucky and Felix Grundy of 
Tennessee, argued that war was key to territorial expansion. Th ey were confi dent that 
if the United States went to war with Britain, those French inhabitants who remained 
in Canada aft er France ceded the territory to Britain would revolt, allowing the United 
States to seize Canada. Th e war hawks also wanted to attack the small Spanish colonies 
in Florida and claim that territory for the United States. With Britain and Spain out of 
the picture, the country could then settle things once and for all on the Indian frontier. 
Republican leader Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts, eager to stop British disruptions 
to American trade in the Atlantic, told President Madison, “By war, we should be purifi 
ed, as by fi re.” 
Federalists, however, saw war as just one more step in a process by which the 
Democratic-Republicans had moved the country into an unnecessary, and commercially 
foolish, hostility with Britain. When Madison asked Congress for a declaration

Before William Henry Harrison, Governor of Indiana Territory, 
led the U.S. Army to attack the Shawnee encampment 
at Prophetstown, Tecumseh met with Harrison in hopes of 
establishing a peace agreement. For all of his distrust, Tecumseh 
was willing to negotiate, and the two met in August 1810. 
Tecumseh spoke little or no English, but the 1810 meeting included 
interpreters. The U.S. government interpreters were careful to 
transcribe the speech as accurately as possible, and the copies 
they sent to Washington became the most accurate account on 
record of Tecumseh’s words. 
Brother, I wish you to listen to me well. I wish to reply to you 
more explicitly as I think you do not clearly understand what I 
before said to you. I shall explain it again…. 
You ought to know that after we agreed to bury the Tomahawk 
at Greenville we then found their new fathers in the Americans 
who told us they would treat us well, not like the British who 
gave us but a small piece of pork every day. I want now to remind 
you of the promises of the white people. You recollect that the 
time the Delawares lived near the white people (Americans) and 
satisfied with the promises of friendship and remained in security, 
yet one of their towns was surprised and the men, women, 
and children murdered. 
The same promises were given to the Shawnees, flags were 
given to them and were told by the Americans that they were 
now children of the Americans. These flags will be as security 
for you; if the white people intend to do you harm hold up your 
flags and no harm will be done you. This was at length practiced 
and the consequence was that the person bearing the flag was 
murdered with others in their village. How my Brother after this 
conduct can you blame me for placing little confidence in the 
promises of our fathers the Americans? 
Brother. Since the peace was made you have kill’d some of the 
Shawnee, Winnebagoes, Delawares, and Miamies and you have 
taken our lands from us, and I do not see how we can remain at 
peace with you if you continue to do so.

of war in June 1812, it passed by the smallest margin of any U.S. declaration of war— 
79–49 in the House and 19–13 in the Senate. Th e nation was far from unanimous in its 
commitment to war, and the war did not go well. 
Madison was confident that the war would be quick and cost little in terms of 
money or American lives. He was terribly wrong. Th e attack on Canada was a disaster. 
Jeff erson and Madison, with their commitment to a small government and modest 
taxes, had kept the army weak while many in Congress who voted for war had also 
voted against every military appropriation in the time leading up to the war. Far fewer 
of the people in Canada, English or French, wanted to become part of the United 
States than the Americans expected. In addition, the British army was strong and had 
been cultivating Indian alliances. 
In July 1812, Detroit fell to British soldiers and Indians led by Tecumseh, and an 
American attack on British forts on the Niagara River failed. Far from taking Canada, 
the opening battles of the war had left the Northwest more open to attack by the 
British and Tecumseh’s tribal alliance. Tecumseh is still remembered as a hero in 
Canada for his role in defending that country. Battles along the frontier were brutal. 
Th e Kentucky militia scalped British soldiers, and Indians scalped American settlers. 
Both sides complained of atrocities. 
At fi rst, the Royal Navy enforced a much tighter blockade on the Atlantic coast 
than Jeff erson’s embargo had ever accomplished, wrecking the U.S. economy. British 
landing parties attacked coastal towns at will. However, an American naval victory on 
Lake Erie by ships under the command of Oliver Hazard Perry gave the country a new 
hero. Shortly aft er, Tecumseh was killed in October 1813 when the U.S. Army won a 
signifi cant victory over combined British and Indian forces at the Battle of the Th ames 
in southern Canada. Th e combined victories brought some safety to the New York, 
Pennsylvania, and Ohio frontier, but all thought of conquering Canada disappeared. 
By 1814, the war turned further against the United States. Napoleon’s abdication 
in April 1814 freed the British for a full-scale fight. In August, British troops 
raided Washington and burned the Capitol and the White House. First Lady Dolly 
Madison collected state papers and the famous Gilbert Stuart painting of George

In August 1814, only a short time after 1800 when they had begun serving as the center of the American 
government, British troops burned both the Capitol building and the White House. The deserted husks of 
both buildings stood until the war ended and they could be rebuilt.

Washington and fl ed just ahead of the British. However, on September 13, the British 
bombardment of Fort McHenry in Baltimore harbor failed to dislodge the American 
garrison. When Francis Scott Key, who was temporarily being held in British custody, 
saw that the American fl ag had not been struck in defeat, he was inspired to write “Th e 
Star-Spangled Banner.” That same month, American forces also stopped a British 
invasion of New York. But stopping invasions was hardly winning the war. 
On the Indian front, however, American forces were achieving some important 
victories. Like the French and Indian War and the American Revolution, the War of 
1812 was a disaster for Indians living east of the Mississippi. Tecumseh’s death at the 
Battle of the Th ames ended the fragile coalition he had built and opened all of Ohio and 
Indiana Territory to rapid white settlement. In the south, at the Battle of Horseshoe 
Bend in March 1814, Andrew Jackson defeated a Creek and Cherokee alliance, killing 
close to 1,000 Indian fi ghters and 2,000 more in subsequent battles, 15 percent of 
the tribes’ total population. “My people are no more!” the Creek leader Red Eagle, or 
William Weatherford, said. In the Treaty of Fort Jackson, the Creeks were forced to 
give up almost 25 million acres in Georgia and Alabama, half of their total land. 
While both sides were winning and losing battles, an American peace delegation of 
Henry Clay, Albert Gallatin, and John Quincy Adams, son of the former president, met 
with their British counterparts in Ghent, Belgium, to negotiate what would become the 
Treaty of Ghent . Despite its strong position in the war, Britain, having ended its hostilities 
with France, was fearing that peace would not last, and it wanted to end its battles 
with the United States to conserve resources. Initially, the British asked for signifi cant 
concessions, including a large protected zone for their Indian allies, but the American 
delegation stalled through much of 1814. Late in the year, fearing the situation with 
France, the British agreed to a treaty that essentially returned all borders and issues to 
their status quo before the war began. It was a wise move for them. Napoleon, living in 
exile on the island of Elba off the Italian coast since his defeat in 1814, returned to power 
briefl y in 1815. He again ruled France until his fi nal defeat by British and German troops 
at the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815. If the British had lost at Waterloo, and the battle 
was a close call, it might have been because their best troops were in North America. 
Even as the Ghent negotiations were taking place, Federalists in New England were 
taking actions against the war. Many New Englanders saw little value in the territorial 
expansion of the country and were convinced that new lands would only mean new 
Democratic-Republican representatives in Congress. Even more, the war had devastated 
the New England economy, which was dependent on international shipping. In 
protest, New England governors ordered their state militias to serve only within the 
borders of their own states. In December 1814, Federalist delegates from across New 
England convened the Hartford Convention in Hartford, Connecticut, to demand 
peace and consider New England’s secession from the Union if peace did not come 
quickly. While a majority of the delegates ultimately opposed secession, the convention 
insisted on the right of nullifi cation, the right of state governments to impede 
Congressional actions within their own boundaries, and proposed amendments to the 
Constitution to protect New England’s power. Delegates to the convention expected 
the Madison administration to give in to their demands, but when news arrived of 
Jackson’s victory in New Orleans and then the peace treaty, the convention did more 
to discredit the Federalist Party than support their cause. Nevertheless, it signaled the 
level of hostility to what many came to call “Mr. Madison’s War.” 
Th e war’s fi nal dramatic Battle of New Orleans was fought aft er the peace treaty 
was already signed but before news of it had reached Jackson or the opposing British 
army. Th e British planned to attack New Orleans so they could win control of the 
Mississippi River and cut U.S. trade on it. Major General Sir Edward Pakenham and 
his 8,000 troops were battle-hardened from years of fi ghting the French, but in New 
Orleans, they faced Jackson’s 4,700 American troops, a collection of regular militia, 
Tennessee and Kentucky volunteers, and pirates and smugglers under the command

of the infamous Jean Lafitte. On January 8, 1815, Pakenham’s troops marched 
straight into a line of fi re organized by Jackson’s army. When, aft er hours of fi ghting, 
the British called for a truce, almost 700 British soldiers had been killed and 1,400 
wounded. Of the Americans, 8 were killed and 13 wounded. It was one of the great 
victories of the war, and it made Jackson a hero and would help make him president. 
And, though it came aft er the peace treaty, it helped convince the British that they 
should, indeed, honor the terms of the treaty, which they might not have done if they 
had taken New Orleans (see Map 8-2 ). 
Far more Americans, Indians, and British soldiers and sailors died in the War of 
1812 than anyone expected when the war began. Indian tribes from the Shawnees to the 
Creeks would never have signifi cant power again. Th e United States was virtually bankrupt 
as a result of the war. Secretary of the Treasury George W. Campbell reported that 
the government needed to borrow $50 million in the fall of 1814 and resigned when he 
could not raise it, and the government, for the only time in history, defaulted on its debts. 
Nevertheless, news of the Treaty of Ghent and of Jackson’s victory in New Orleans 
was met with national celebrations. Henry Clay asked, “What is our present situation?” 
and answered his own question: “Respectability and character abroad—security 
and confi dence at home.” Daniel Webster, who as a representative from Massachusetts 
had opposed the war, now said: 
Th e peace brought about an entirely new and a most interesting state of things: 
it opened us to other prospects and suggested other duties. We ourselves were 
changed, and the whole world was changed. 
It was an odd mood for a nation that had lost more battles than it won, come close to 
bankruptcy, and still had its new capital city laying in ashes. But Webster captured the 
national mood better than the statistics. Th e end of Britain’s long war with France also 
brought an end to Britain’s war with the United States, which had continued in various 
forms of confl ict for 40 years.

MAP 8-2 Fighting the War of 1812. Few parts of the United States were exempt from the fi ghting of the War of 1812. The British navy maintained a highly 
eff ective blockade of the nation’s ports, bringing commerce to a stall and making it easy to attack and burn the capital in 1814. The American navy was more 
successful in battles on the Great Lakes while armies fought all along the Mississippi River from Tippecanoe in Indiana Territory to the fi nal battle in New Orleans 
at the war’s end.

Almost immediately aft er the war ended, Britain and the United States negotiated 
a commercial treaty that gave the United States trading rights with Britain and much 
of Britain’s empire. Two years later, in 1817, the Rush-Bagot Treaty guaranteed the 
disarmament of the Great Lakes, and the year aft er that another treaty, the Anglo- 
American Convention, resolved much of the border between the United States and 
Canada. Th ese treaties were the beginning of long-lasting peace on the northern border 
of the United States. Indeed, aft er 1815, both Europe and America settled into a 
long period of relative peace and mutual prosperity. 
In spite of all the complaints about the war, the years during which the region’s ports 
were closed were a time when some residents began manufacturing enterprises that in 
the years ahead would fuel rapid industrialization of the region. Th e United States was 
considerably more self-suffi cient at war’s end than it had ever been before. Still, trade 
with Europe aft er the war’s end not only resumed but also quickly exceeded all previous 
levels. In addition, with peace came further territorial expansion and an extraordinary 
economic and commercial transition that fundamentally changed the nation. Perhaps 
most important of all, as Webster and Clay both claimed, the overall eff ect of the war 
left the United States a much more confi dent and proud nation than it had been up to 
that time. Men like Webster and Clay who were prophets of that confi dence and pride, 
would be national leaders for the next several decades of the nation’s life.

Quick Review Why did the War of 1812 and the events leading up to it split the nation? 
Based on events in the early 1800s, did Madison make the right decision? 
EXPANDING AMERICAN TERRITORY AND INFLUENCE 
Analyze how the United States acquired new territory and increased influence abroad. 
In spite of wars and tensions, territorial expansion continued under Jefferson’s 
handpicked successors, presidents James Madison (1809–1817) and James Monroe 
(1817–1825) as it had under Jeff erson. During this 24 year period, three men who were 
political allies from the same political party and the same state governed the nation, 
seeking many of the same goals. Rapid growth fundamentally changed the country. In 
1799, Daniel Boone, who had created the fi rst white settlements in Kentucky during 
the Revolution, moved with his family yet again, this time across the Mississippi River 
into Spanish-controlled Missouri. Other American settlers from Kentucky followed, 
seeking ever more land. Th ey assumed that their rights as American citizens went with 
them and that, eventually, American sovereignty would follow. Th e Louisiana Purchase 
in 1803 confi rmed Boone’s assumptions. 
Other Americans followed Boone’s pattern in Florida, Texas, New Mexico, and 
California. Americans ventured far beyond the borders of the United States and 
expected, oft en demanded, that the American government continue to protect them 
and eventually annex new lands to the Union. Many in the government agreed with 
the settlers, and successive governments, anxious to expand or consolidate regional 
control, approved. 
During the War of 1812, the military victories of William Henry Harrison over the 
Shawnees in the Old Northwest fi nalized the opening of Ohio and the future states of 
Indiana and Illinois to white settlement. At the same time, Andrew Jackson’s defeat of 
the Creeks and Cherokees in the Old Southwest opened up huge new tracts of land in 
what would become the states of Mississippi and Alabama. With the lands ceded by 
Britain in 1783 and the vast Louisiana Purchase now fi rmly under American control, 
the most obvious pieces of real estate left for further U.S. annexation aft er the War of 
1812 were the territories known as West and East Florida, still controlled by Spain, 
and the Oregon Territory that several European powers claimed.

Florida and Oregon 
West Florida was more or less the southern third of what would eventually be 
Mississippi and Alabama while East Florida was what is today the state of Florida. To 
the United States, foreign control of those lands represented multiple threats. It gave 
Spain control of most access to the Gulf of Mexico, which was a threat to U.S. shipping. 
Slaves and others seeking to escape U.S. jurisdiction could easily escape south along 
a long, unguarded border and melt into the vast, unruly lands of Florida. Seminole 
Indians, already refugees from the growing white population north of Florida, oft en 
welcomed escaped slaves and created new communities that were united in their dislike 
of the Americans. Americans just north of the Florida border were hungry for 
more land. Many ignored international boundaries and crossed into Florida to farm 
and build settlements. These settlers in turn demanded U.S. protection from the 
Seminoles and Creeks, who had been displaced by the Treaty of Fort Jackson and were 
determined to defend their new land in Florida. 
In 1817, Andrew Jackson, a military hero aft er his victories in 1814 and 1815, told 
President James Monroe and Secretary of State John Quincy Adams that he could 
seize Florida in 60 days. Th e president and Adams did not want a war with Spain but, 
in language that was deliberately vague, called on Jackson to attack the Seminoles who 
were harassing white settlers and gave him “full powers to conduct the war in the 
manner he may judge best.” Given how Jackson had conducted the war against the 
Creeks, Monroe and Adams knew what their orders meant. 
Jackson’s army marched into Florida. Th ey could not fi nd many Seminoles, who 
were adept at disappearing into swamps and marshes, but they burned their villages 
and crops. Th ey also seized Spanish forts and arrested a Scots trader named Alexander 
Arbuthnot and another British subject, Robert Armbrister, charged them with assisting 
the Seminoles, and aft er a quick trial executed both. When his troops did fi nd 
Seminole and Creek leaders, Jackson simply executed them, including Hillis Hadjo, a 
Creek spiritual prophet who had been part of Tecumseh’s movement. 
Th e execution of Indians did not cause an uproar in the United States or Europe, 
but an American general executing British subjects in Spanish territory caused an 
international incident. Monroe and Adams, however, were skillful diplomats. Th ey 
managed both to distance themselves from Jackson and use what Adams called “the 
Jackson Magic”—his immense popularity aft er his victories in the War of 1812—to 
bring pressure on Spain. 
In fact, Spain did not care much about Florida but did have serious concerns about 
the independence movements in the Spanish colonies in Mexico and South America. 
The Spanish authorities wanted assurance that the United States would not aid or 
recognize these revolutions. Spain was also deeply worried about its control of the 
land from Texas to California. It was more than willing to trade Florida for assurances 
about Texas and the revolutions further south. Monroe briefl y considered making a 
bid for Texas, but he decided that it was more trouble than it was worth and agreed to 
the treaty. 
Instead of pursuing a claim to Texas, Monroe and Adams decided to ask Spain 
for its support in the areas that Lewis and Clark had explored. Spain, Great Britain, 
and Russia all claimed the same territory along the Pacifi c coast known as Oregon. 
By the late 1700s, explorers from New Spain were making claims as far north as 
Alaska. At the same time, Russian fur traders and explorers had established permanent 
Russian settlements, complete with Orthodox churches, in Alaska and almost 
as far south as San Francisco. British sea captains, notably James Cook in the 1770s, 
had explored the Oregon coast. British explorers coming overland from Canada 
made land claims, among them the Hudson’s Bay Company trading post at the 
mouth of the Columbia River, which represented the largest European settlement in 
the region. An earlier U.S. claim, based on Lewis and Clark’s explorations in 1805, 
was weak by comparison, and there were no U.S. settlements in Oregon. Of course, 

8.2 
8.4 
8.3 
Chapter 8 Creating a New People, Expanding the Country 253 
the native peoples of the region had little use for any of the claims, though they 
traded with all the claimants. Nevertheless, despite its weak claim, the United States 
had an interest in Oregon. While some in Congress thought Oregon was far too 
distant and barren to be of interest, Adams—prompted by the merchant and fur 
trader John Jacob Astor—saw the value of an American presence at the mouth of the 
Columbia River, not only for access to the fur trade there but as a way to enter the 
Pacifi c trade with Asia. 
In the 1819 Adams-Onís Treaty with Spain, Spain not only ceded Florida to the 
United States but also agreed to transfer Spanish rights to the Oregon Territory to the 
United States. It was a signifi cant accomplishment. Th e United States paid $5 million 
in Spanish debts, and the deal was done. All of Florida was now a U.S. territory. 
While the United States was negotiating with Spain, it was also negotiating with Great 
Britain about Oregon. In 1818, Adams negotiated the Anglo-American Convention in 
which Britain and the United States agreed to joint control of the Pacifi c Northwest 
for 10 years and to resolve other issues in the future. Th e two treaties with Spain and 
Britain gave the United States as strong a claim to Oregon as either Britain or Russia, a 
claim it would not forget. Just before he ended his tenure as Secretary of State, Adams 
agreed to an 1824 treaty with Russia that set the border of Alaska much farther north, 
leaving it to the United States and Britain to resolve questions about Oregon, which 
they fi nally did; only in 1846 (see Map 8-3 ).

The Monroe Doctrine 
Having taken Florida and asserted a claim to Oregon, the United States agreed—for 
the time being—to stay out of Spain’s way in Texas and California. Nevertheless, the 
Monroe administration took further steps to consolidate U.S. power in the Americas. 
In 1822, despite earlier promises to Spain, the United States offi cially recognized the 
new independent states of Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru. If Latin America was, 
in fact, going to be independent of Spain, then the United States meant to be both the 
region’s benefactor and prime trade partner. 
Th en, going a big step further in a speech to Congress in December 1823, President 
Monroe declared that, henceforth, the United States would not allow European intervention 
or the acquisition of any new territory by a European power in North and 
South America. Coming less than a decade aft er the United States had almost lost 
its independence in the War of 1812, it was a bold announcement. A complex set of 
international developments led Monroe and Secretary of State John Quincy Adams to 
formulate this stance, which became known as the Monroe Doctrine . 
On the Pacifi c coast, Russian Tsar Alexander I was pressing Russian claims not 
only to Alaska but also to much of the Oregon Territory in the Pacifi c Northwest. In 
1821, Alexander issued an imperial edict that claimed much of the Pacifi c coast and 
gave the Russian-American Company the right to trade there. Th e Russians threatened 
to confi scate American ships that traveled too far north, even though more American 
than Russian sailors were actually taking the sea lions and whales and trading with 
the Alaskan natives. Nevertheless, for the United States, Russian actions represented a 
dangerous European intrusion. 
Halfway across the world, Greek patriots, borrowing language from the American 
Revolution, declared independence from the Ottoman Empire, and liberal constitutionalists 
briefl y took power in Spain. Th e Greek and Spanish revolts were tricky 
for Monroe and Adams. Many Americans were sympathetic with the Greeks, but 
the administration also wanted good relationships with the Ottomans. In addition, 
American sentiment was on the side of a revolution in Spain. These situations in 
Monroe Doctrine 
A declaration by President James Monroe in 
1823 that the Western Hemisphere was to be 
closed off to further European colonization 
and that the United States would not allow 
European interference in the internal affairs 
of independent nations anywhere in the 
Americas. 
Russian claims to Alaska dated back to the 1700s, but by the 1820s, the Russians were building up colonies, 
including their largest one in Sitka, Alaska. These outposts, complete with Russian Orthodox churches, 
fostered trade with indigenous Alaskans and provided fresh supplies for ships taking fi sh and sea lions off 
the coast.

Chapter 8 Creating a New People, Expanding the Country 255 
Europe, though not the center of American concern, still had to be responded to carefully, 
given the strength of public opinion. Much more pressing, however, was the 
revolutionary activity in the Americas. Taking the wrong side in the revolutions of 
Latin America could hurt the United States politically and economically for a long 
time to come while little could be gained from interfering in Europe. 
At the tense moment when the United States was considering ways to respond 
to Russian pressure and to revolutions around the world, British Foreign Secretary 
George Canning proposed a joint British-American declaration in which both nations 
would oppose European intervention in the Americas, including eff orts to restore 
Spain’s control, and that neither Great Britain nor the United States would have any 
territorial interests in the Americas. Canning’s proposal was a problem for Monroe 
and Adams. Th ey did not want Spain to reassert power in the Americas, and Britain’s 
infl uence would be helpful in preventing it. But both the president and his secretary 
of state had their eyes on eventual U.S. takeover of parts of the Spanish Empire, from 
Texas to California and perhaps Cuba. Canning’s hands-off agreement would jeopardize 
long-term American interests. 
In the end, Monroe and Adams concluded that they would leave it to the 
Europeans to deal with Greece and Spain and essentially declared noninvolvement 
in the “ internal aff airs of Europe.” On the other hand, they used President Monroe’s 
December 2, 1823, message to Congress to say that any nation of the Americas that 
had assumed “free and independent conditions” would “henceforth not be considered 
as subjects of colonization by any European power.” Many Europeans were amazed 
at what they saw as the arrogance of the new and still relatively weak United States. It 
was not clear that the country could enforce the new policy. But the Monroe Doctrine, 
which began as a simple diplomatic maneuver, became a bedrock of U.S. foreign 
policy. Th e independence not only of the United States but of all of the independent 
Americas from European control was, it seemed, the country’s business. Th e new policy 
had no impact on Britain’s long-standing control of Canada or Russia’s dominance 
of Alaska or, indeed, on those colonies that Spain still claimed in Latin America. But 
it did announce that the United States would oppose any new colonies anywhere in 
the Americas. With the Monroe Doctrine, the U.S. government was again refl ecting 
Jeff ersonian pragmatism. It might be a small country of farmers, but the United States 
was claiming vast new infl uence in all of North and South America. It was a diplomatic 
expansion that was being matched by an era of economic expansion, growth 
that was unimagined when Th omas Jeff erson took the oath of offi ce in 1801. 
8.5 
Quick Review How did the outcome of the War of 1812 allow the U.S. government to 
pursue its expansionist goals and issue the Monroe Doctrine? 
CONCLUSION 
When Th omas Jeff erson became president of the United States in 1801, much of the 
country’s population, cities, seaports, agriculture, industry, indeed, much of its economy, 
was contained within the original 13 states. Within the next 20 years, under his 
leadership and that of handpicked successors James Madison and James Monroe, the 
country’s territorial claims would extend to the Pacifi c Ocean. Much of this growth 
originated in Jefferson’s republican beliefs and his agrarian ideal of a nation of 
independent farmers rather than a nation run by any elites. 
Signifi cant political and social developments also occurred during the fi rst two 
decades of the 1800s. With the U.S. Supreme Court’s Marbury v. Madison decision 
in 1803, the Court essentially gave itself the authority to decide the constitutionality 
of any law passed by Congress. Religion played an increasing role in society, even as

the last states ended their support for specifi c churches. Many Protestant groups made 
signifi cant new gains among both white and black adherents with revivals in what 
came to be known as the Second Great Awakening. 
Th e Louisiana Purchase opened up trade along the Mississippi River and through 
New Orleans. Lewis and Clark led an expedition to explore the huge expanse of new 
U.S. territory, even venturing beyond its scope to reach the Pacific Ocean. Their 
explorations, aided greatly by various Indian tribes, revealed tremendous potential for 
future American growth. 
Tensions leading up to the War of 1812 began during Jeff erson’s term and came 
to a head under the administration of Madison. Ultimately, the inconclusive war 
resolved issues that had limited U.S. development for decades, and launched a new 
period of growth for the country. It was the last war ever fought between the United 
States and Great Britain. It was also the last war in which Indian tribes were allied with 
another nation against the United States, and aft erward, the United States dealt with 
Native Americans as an “internal matter” rather than a focus of foreign policy. 
Although the cost was high in terms of lives lost, money spent, and economies 
devastated, the end of the war left the United States more confi dent, proud, and selfsuffi 
cient than ever before. With peace came further territorial expansion, especially a 
series of treaties between 1817and 1823 that established the border with Canada, gave 
the nation joint ownership of the Oregon Territory with Great Britain, and gave the 
country control of Florida. Th e end of the war also launched an extraordinary economic 
and commercial transition that fundamentally changed the nation and transformed 
the lives of Americans. Th e bold new confi dence of the United States, refl ected 
in the Monroe Doctrine declaring that there could be no new European claims on any 
lands in North or South America, surprised the world.

JEFFERSON AND THE REPUBLICAN IDEAL 
8.1 
Explain how Jefferson’s republicanism shaped and refl ected 
the nation’s democratic culture. 
Summary 
Jeff erson’s style and tone refl ected his commitment to republicanism. 
As president, he cut taxes except for the tariff , shrank 
the federal government, and cut the size of the army and navy. 
Democratic-Republican efforts to prevent the appointment 
of a Federalist judge led to the Marbury v. Madison decision, 
a Supreme Court ruling that established the court’s right to 
declare an act of Congress unconstitutional. In 1801, the occupations, 
opinions, and manners of most American voters were 
compatible with Jeff erson’s agrarian ideal of a nation of independent 
farmers. Over the course of the early 1800s, virtually all 
property qualifi cations for voting disappeared, a refl ection of the 
national consensus that had emerged around republican ideals. 
Review Questions 
1. Contextualization 
What did Americans in the early 1800s mean by the terms 
equality and independence ? What role did these terms play 
in shaping their social and political ideals? 
2. Crafting Arguments 
Defend or refute the following statement: Th omas Jeff erson, 
in both his policy choices and personal life, embodied the 
spirit of republicanism in the early 1800s. What evidence

THE IDEAL OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM 
8.2 
Explain how Americans applied new individualist ideals in their 
religion and how the expansion of faith-based organizations 
supported, yet also challenged, Jeffersonian republicanism. 
Summary 
By the early 1800s, more and more Americans were coming to the 
conclusion that the republican ideal required a strict separation 
of church and state. By 1833, state support for specifi c religious 
organizations had disappeared in the United States. Between 
1760 and 1800, Americans had grown less and less religious. In 
the early 1800s, however, a religious revival known as the Second 
Great Awakening swept over the nation. The revivals of this 
period marked the emergence of Methodist and Baptist churches 
as major forces in American religious life. African-Americans, 
both free and enslaved, participated in the religious revival of this 
period by joining white congregations and by forming their own 
churches. During this same period, limitations on the political 
rights of Catholic and Jewish Americans were removed. 
Review Questions 
4. Comparison 
Compare and contrast the views of Th omas Jeff erson and 
Lyman Beecher on the relationship between church and 
state. What conflicting values were at the heart of their 
disagreement? 
5. Historical Interpretation 
When some historians have described the United States as 
being built on faith in “dynamic democracy” and “evangelical 
religion,” what did they mean? Is this description 
an accurate interpretation of U.S. history in the years from 
1800 to 1820? 
6. Crafting Arguments 
Why did African-Americans, both slave and free, develop 
their own segregated religious institutions and gatherings over 
the course of the early 1800s? What needs might such churches 
and gatherings have met that white churches did not? 
Preparing to Write: Write a Conclusion 
An essay should include a conclusion that wraps up the arguments 
laid out in the essay. Suppose you wanted to write an essay

BEYOND THE MISSISSIPPI: THE LOUISIANA PURCHASE AND 
THE EXPEDITION OF LEWIS AND CLARK 
8.3 
Explain what effects the Louisiana Purchase and the westward 
expansion had on how Americans saw themselves. 
Summary 
Economic and political concerns led Jeff erson to off er to buy 
New Orleans from the French. When, instead, Napoleon off ered 
to sell the entire Louisiana Territory, Jeff erson jumped at the 
chance, despite his misgivings about whether the Constitution 
allowed him to make that decision. Th rough this purchase, the 
United States almost doubled its land area. Even more important, 
it gained control of New Orleans and both sides of the 
Mississippi River from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico.

THE WAR OF 1812 
8.4 Analyze the causes and impact of the War of 1812. 
Summary 
Th e tensions that led the United States and Great Britain to go to 
war in 1812 had been consistent since the Battles of Lexington and 
Concord in 1775. In spite of treaties, the two nations were never 
fully at peace and each made alliances with Indian tribes to make 
trouble for the other. Th e French Revolution and the Napoleonic 
Wars led to increased confl ict between Britain and the United 
States. British naval and trade policies produced intense resentment 
in the United States. Eff orts of the Jeff erson administration 
to apply economic pressure on Britain failed. At the same time, 
new warfare between the United States and American Indian 
tribes broke out in the Ohio country. A new tribal alliance, supported 
by Britain and led by a charismatic religious fi gure named 
Tenskwatawa, or Th e Prophet, and his half-brother, the military 
leader Tecumseh, brought fear to white settlers and tough challenges 
to the small U.S. Army. In 1812, congressional war hawks 
pressured President Madison into asking Congress for a declaration 
of war. Aft er 3 years of bloody fi ghting, the war ended with 
agreements that offi cially returned all matters to their prewar status 
but actually benefi tted the United States. As with the previous 
wars, the War of 1812 was a disaster for American Indians.

EXPANDING AMERICAN TERRITORY AND INFLUENCE 
8.5 
Analyze how the United States acquired new territory and 
increased infl uence abroad. 
Summary 
With the end of the War of 1812 in 1815 came further territorial 
expansion. Th e era of Jeff erson’s successors, Presidents Madison 
and Monroe, was one of rapid growth that fundamentally changed 
the nation. In the Adams-Onís Treaty with Spain of 1819, Spain 
agreed to cede Florida to the United States and to also transfer 
Spanish rights to the Oregon Territory to the United States. In 1822, 
in spite of previous promises to Spain, the United States offi cially 
recognized the new independent republics of Chile, Colombia, 
Mexico, and Peru. In December 1823, President Monroe declared 
through the Monroe Doctrine that, henceforth, the United States 
would not allow European intervention in any of the aff airs of the 
independent countries of North and South America. 
Review Questions 
12. Crafting Arguments 
Evaluate the role of individual American settlers in shaping 
American foreign policy in the early 1800s. How did 
the desire of Americans to move beyond the boundaries of 
the United States create both opportunities and challenges

In what ways did the articulation of the Monroe Doctrine 
represent a turning point in American history? What light 
does the doctrine shed on the vision of America’s future

Chapter 9 New Industries, New Politics 259 
The end of the War of 1812, Andrew Jackson’s victory at New Orleans, 
the American takeover of Florida, and the Monroe Doctrine were 
all far from primary concerns of many Americans in the years aft er 
1815. Something much closer to home—cotton—was transforming their 
lives. The rapid growth of cotton production changed the lives of more 
Americans, whether or not they were directly involved in cotton production, 
than any other development between 1800 and the Civil War. Cotton 
transformed the nation’s physical, commercial, and political landscape. 
Henry Bibb, a former slave, described what cotton meant to him and his 
fellow slaves on a Louisiana cotton plantation that had only recently been 
developed: 
Th e object of blowing the horn for them two hours before day, was, 
that they should get their bit to eat, before they went to the fi eld, 
that they need not stop to eat but once during the day....I have oft en 
heard the sound of the slave driver’s lash on the backs, of slaves, 
and their heart-rending shrieks....I have known the slaves to be so 
much fatigued from labor that they could scarcely get to their lodging 
places from the fi elds at night. 
Slaves working on the new cotton plantations of the ever expanding 
cotton-growing regions of the nation knew little respite from the fatiguing 
labor. They had to clear the land before they could plant, and once 
planted, the cotton plants needed almost constant care. Th e harvest was

intensive, and much work was required aft erward to prepare the harvest for market. 
Because of the value of the cotton crop and increasing demands for it, there was 
constant pressure to work harder and no end to the punishment for those who did 
not produce as expected. 
While Bibb and thousands of other slaves cultivated the cotton, young women 
working in the mills, or textile factories, of Lowell, Massachusetts, turned it into cloth 
to be sold around the world. An anonymous worker described her life in a mill: 
Since I was between seven and eight years old, I have been employed almost 
without intermission in a factory, which is almost 18 years....I do not wonder 
at your surprise that the operatives were worked in the summer season, from 
five in the morning till seven in the evening....The time we are required to 
labor is altogether too long. It is more than our constitutions can bear. If any 
one doubts it, let them come into our mills of a summer’s day, at four or fi ve 
o’clock, in the aft ernoon, and see the drooping, weary persons moving about, 
as though their legs were hardly able to support their bodies. 
North or South, for slaves in fi elds and workers in factories, cotton was wearying work. 
For some, cotton brought extraordinary wealth as “King Cotton” came to dominate 
the U.S. economy, but for others, drudgery permeated life. In one way or another, the 
rise and dominance of the cotton industry aff ected almost all Americans. 
The transformation of the U.S. economy immediately after the War of 1812 
involved many changes that made cotton dominant, including new inventions like 
cotton gins and steamboats, new institutions like corporations, and a diff erent kind of 
bank—all of which worked together to expand the national economy. Th ese changing 
economic and social structures also aff ected the political scene. Th e new cotton-based 
economy made slaves much more valuable and slave owners more anxious to defend 
slavery. At the same time, many northerners, including northerners in cotton industries, 
became more hostile to slaveholding, which led to deep national divisions. 
CREATING THE COTTON ECONOMY 
Explain the role of cotton in transforming the land and the lives of diverse people in the 
United States. 
Cotton’s dominant role in the economy came about quickly. In 1800, a few southern 
plantations grew enough cotton to make cloth for their own use and ship a few bags 
to England, but the dominant plantation cash crops were rice, indigo, tobacco, and in 
southern Louisiana, sugar. But aft er the War of 1812, cotton quickly outstripped every 
other American export and remained a major American industry until the 1930s. 
Demand and Technology 
Two developments in the late 1790s set the stage for the rapid expansion of cotton 
production in the United States. First, during this period, many Europeans came to 
prefer cotton clothing to the wool or linen that had clothed them for generations. 
Cotton was cooler and more comfortable than wool, and it was getting cheaper. Most 
of Europe’s cotton came from India via Great Britain’s East India Company, but India 
could not produce enough cotton to meet Europe’s growing demand. 
The second development was a set of technological changes that launched the 
worldwide expansion of cotton. In England in 1733, John Kay invented a “flying 
shuttle” that made weaving cloth much faster and allowed a single weaver to handle a 
loom that previously required many weavers. In 1764, James Hargreaves invented the 
spinning jenny, which could run multiple spindles, each spinning cotton into thread. 
By 1800, a single jenny could be seen operating up to 120 spindles at once. In 1769, 
Richard Arkwright patented a “water frame” that used waterpower to drive the spinning 
process, a major step toward mass production, while James Watt’s coal-powered

steam engine, designed in 1763, added steam power to the English mills, expanding 
their size long before it provided the energy for railroads and ships. 
Although developed in England, much of this technology was soon brought to the 
United States through transfers, legal or otherwise. British authorities knew that their 
new means of production were key to their industrial and political might. Th ey provided 
patents for their inventors and kept their production process secret. However, 
in 1789, an Englishman, Samuel Slater, having been sworn to secrecy and apprenticed 
in Arkwright’s textile business, sailed to New York to bring the industry to the United 
States. Slater ignored Arkwright’s patents and recreated Arkwright’s mechanical spinning 
in mills in Rhode Island. More technological transfers followed. 
Despite the worldwide demand for cotton and England’s growing industrial capacity 
for turning raw cotton into cloth, American farmers and plantation owners were 
skeptical that they could make money on it. Green-seed, or upland, cotton was the 
only kind that would grow in the American South, except for a few places on the coast 
or coastal islands where a more profi table variety of long-stem cotton grew. But each 
ball of cotton produced on a green-seed cotton plant contained many of those green 
seeds. Th ey had to be removed by hand before the cotton could be spun into threads. 
A slave, working hard all day, could clean about 1 pound of cotton, hardly enough to 
make a meaningful profi t. Many people sought a mechanical way to clean cotton. Eli 
Whitney, a recent Yale graduate who had gone south to work as a tutor, lived on the 
Greene family plantation at Mulberry Grove in Georgia where he became interested 
in devising a machine to clean cotton. He gained fame, if not fortune, for his patent on 
the cotton gin ( gin was short for engine ). 
While serving as a tutor and tinkering with how to clean cotton, Whitney decided 
to try pulling the picked cotton through a screen that would allow the seeds to fall 
out and the clean cotton fi bers to be baled for shipment. When the fi rst model failed 
because the wooden teeth were too brittle, Catherine Greene, the matron of the plantation, 
suggested wire (from her bird cage) and a brush to keep the seeds from clogging 
the works. Th e cotton gin that Whitney patented in 1794 could clean 50 pounds of 
cotton a day. Others quickly improved on Whitney’s model, and manufacturing cotton 
gins became a big business from Natchez, Mississippi, to Bridgewater, Massachusetts.

Whitney did not make his fortune from this invention; too many other people were 
improving it too quickly. However, he did become rich developing the idea of interchangeable 
parts and manufacturing rifl es with such parts for the U.S. government. 
Interchangeable parts made everything from rifl es to farm implements easier to repair 
since a replacement part could be counted on to work in the original gun or machine. 
Th e cotton gin transformed the nation. Th e United States now had an export crop 
that could make it prosperous. Th e cotton market and the technology that made it 
possible led to the rapid development of new lands, especially the great plantations of 
Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana. In turn, the New England factory system that 
began in Rhode Island expanded to the great mill center of Lowell, Massachusetts, in 
1823 and then to factories and factory towns all over the region. As the cotton market 
continued to grow, coastal and transatlantic shipping also expanded as more and 
more southern cotton was brought to the mills of New England and to the even larger 
mills of Manchester and Birmingham in England itself. Th is rather plain and simple 
product was a driving force for economics and technology in the period, and it 
seemed to have no limits. 
The Land of Cotton 
While some of the nation’s fi rst export cotton, the long-stem variety, was grown along 
the Atlantic coast and especially on the Sea Islands off the coast of the Carolinas and 
Georgia, the greatest cotton production involved the green-seed variety on the plantations 
of the so-called black belt (named for its rich black soil), stretching from Georgia 
to Louisiana. Th e quality of the soil made it perfect for growing cotton. 
Within this black-belt area, only Georgia was one of the 13 original states. Th e 
northern parts of Alabama and Mississippi were part of the land Britain ceded to the 
United States at the end of the Revolution. Th e Louisiana Purchase added Louisiana. 
Andrew Jackson’s defeat of the Creeks during the War of 1812 and the “Creek 
Cession” that he negotiated in 1816 opened much new land to white settlement, while 
the 1819 U.S. treaty with Spain placed the Gulf Coast of Mississippi and Alabama 
under U.S. control. White settlers—often single men, sometimes families—from 
Georgia, Tennessee, the Carolinas, and Europe, especially many Scots-Irish, poured 
in and brought black slaves with them. A land rush that was known as “Alabama 
Fever” began in 1816 just as the War of 1812 ended. Alabama was admitted as a state 
in 1819 with a non-Indian population of 128,000, fi ve times what it had been in 1810. 
Louisiana and Mississippi were admitted in 1812 and 1817, respectively (see Map 9-1 ). 
Th e federal government played a central role in the development of these lands. 
Th e fi rst European settlers were illegal white squatters moving onto farms recently 
abandoned by Indians, but after the coming of peace in 1815, the federal government 
quickly began offi cial surveys and legal sales of the land. Before the War of 1812, 
the largest sales of federal lands in 1 year had been 350,000 acres. In 1815, a million 
acres of newly acquired lands were sold at $2 per acre, and in 1818, 2.5 million acres 
were sold as the government acquired land from the Creeks and then from Spain and 
quickly made it available for sale. Th ese sales helped the federal budget, and white settlement 
surged. Th e government spent some of the revenue from land sales on maintaining 
the army that protected the new lands. It also aided settlement by building a 
road from Columbia, South Carolina, to Columbus, Georgia, and then farther into the 
black-belt region (see Map 9-2 ). 
Th e new land was fertile. Planters who had grown 300 pounds of cotton per acre in 
South Carolina could grow 800 to 1,000 pounds an acre in the black belt. In 1801, nine 
percent of the world’s cotton came from the United States while 60 percent came from 
India. By 1820, the United States was exporting more cotton than India. By 1850, the 
American South was producing more than two-thirds of the world’s cotton. Th e new 
technology, the new land, and the institution of slavery created great wealth for some; 
a poor, hard-earned living for others; and backbreaking, torturous misery for slaves.

MAP 9-1 The Growth of Slavery in the Black Belt. As the black-belt area of cotton production expanded, 
slave labor became they key to its success and the number of slaves grew dramatically. 
The People Who Worked the Land—Cotton and the Transformation 
of Slavery 
Th e white settlers who were able to buy large parcels of land in the rich new territory 
of what was known as the Old Southwest did not do most of the hard work of actually 
planting, hoeing, and picking the cotton that would be grown there. Other Americans 
did that work: African slaves, whose lives were also transformed by the explosive 
growth of cotton production and whose value to their white owners increased even 
more than the value of the new land on which they labored. 
Between 1800 and 1860, more than 1 million black Americans were forced to 
move from the homes they knew—and oft en from their families, too—to new homes 
in the interior cotton-growing lands of Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana 
and later Arkansas and Texas. While slavery slowly disappeared in the North aft er 
1800 and the slave population of Maryland, Virginia, and the Carolinas stabilized or 
declined, slavery exploded in the new land. In the 60 years before the Civil War, more 
slaves made the journey from coastal states to inland plantations than had made the 
terrible Middle Passage from Africa to North America in the previous 200 years. 
In some ways similar to the passage from Africa to North America, the journey 
from a settled community in Virginia, Maryland, or the Carolinas to the new interior 
plantations was a terrible ordeal. As more slaves were sold into the interior or sold 
from place to place within it, slaves on the coast lived in terror of being sold and losing 
all connections to family and birthplace. Slave owners used the threat of sale, or 
the sale of a perceived troublemaker, to maintain discipline in the slave quarter. Slaves 
oft en pleaded with masters not to be sold. Sometimes the pleas were successful but 
oft en not. Jeff Randolph, the executor of Th omas Jeff erson’s estate, was considered 
especially humane because he refused to sell the former president’s slaves to a buyer 
from Georgia but sold them instead, at less profi t, to other Virginians. Th e sale of a

spouse broke up one slave marriage in fi ve, and one-third of all slave children were 
sold away from their parents. Men were sold more oft en than women; planters wanted 
male muscle, and slave owners in older regions were happy to keep women so that 
they could bear more children who could, in turn, also be sold. Slaves between ages 
14 and 35 were sold much more oft en than the very young or the aging. A literate 
slave, Arena Screven, learned that he was to be sold from Georgia to New Orleans and 
wrote to his wife “with much regret” that he hoped “if we shall not meet in this world I 
hope to meet in heaven.” Laura Clark, a slave, remembered her mother asking another 
slave, who had been sold in the same group as she to “take care of my baby child... 
and if I never sees her no more raise her for God.” Such heartbreak led many slaves to 
despair, to run away, or to rebel. 
Once sold, either to a plantation owner who had come east for additional slaves or 
more oft en to a slave trader whose job was brokering other humans, slaves were organized 
in groups called slave coffl es to walk west. Coffl es of 20 to 50 slaves, sometimes 
more, trudging west became a normal sight of southern life. Walking 15 to 20 miles 
a day, it could take the slaves 2 months to go from Virginia to the Mississippi Valley, 
oft en longer when rain fl ooded streams and turned roads to mud. In later years, more 
slaves were transported by ship to New Orleans, which became the largest slave-trading 
center in the United States by the 1820s. 
When they could, slaves rebelled. Slave trading was a dangerous business, and stories 
of slaves murdering slave traders were well known. In 1841, slaves being shipped 
from Norfolk, Virginia, to New Orleans on the Creole forced the captain to deliver 
them to the Bahamas, a British colony, where they found freedom because Britain 
had abolished slavery in 1833. More oft en, slaves simply ran away when they could, 
though many went home to family where they were recaptured and sold again. 
Once slaves arrived at their destination, they oft en faced diffi cult and unfamiliar 
work. Work in cotton fi elds was backbreaking for men, women, and children. While 
tobacco and rice required more skill, cotton required long hours and hard work.

Cotton was planted in the early spring and required constant attention and weeding 
throughout the growing season. On most plantations, there was a strict gender divide: 
men plowed, and women and children hoed. Harvest began as early as August and 
lasted through September and October. Slaves worked the longest hours—from sunrise 
to sunset, and if there was a moon, much longer—to get the whole crop in before 
storms could hurt it. Prickly cotton pods cut their hands, and slaves who did not produce 
their quota were beaten at day’s end. Finally, with the full crop in, there was a 
brief respite. But the winter was the time for the women to work the cotton gin and 
pack the cotton for market while men cleared more land and repaired buildings. 
Contrary to many images of the old South, most cotton was grown on relatively small 
farms. Many of those who fi rst settled and began growing cotton on the new rich lands 
owned relatively small plots of land and one or a few slaves. Th ese white owners worked in 
the fi elds with the slaves or, if the farm was larger, served as their overseers. Less than one 
percent of the population owned the great plantations for which the South became known. 
In the largest plantations owned by the most wealthy planters, slaves worked in large gangs 
with certain slaves appointed as “drivers” to get the work done and poor whites employed 
as overseers to manage the whole labor force. It was on the large plantations, with constant 
pressure on the overseers to ensure profi ts, that slaves faced some of the worst conditions. 
Slaves established new communities within the slave quarters. Young slaves met 
new partners, children were born, and the rhythms of community life were reestablished, 
but always under threat of dissolution. New leaders emerged within the slave 
community, oft en preachers and deacons selected by other slaves. Although legally 
banned from learning to read or write, slaves sometime secretly did both and taught 
others to do so. As memories of Africa or the African-American communities on the 
east coast faded in later generations, a new culture was created in the slave communities, 
drawing on older traditions and adapting to new contexts. Oft en with the permission 
of their owners, slaves grew their own food, made cloth for better clothing than 
their owners gave them, and even earned cash by selling surplus food and clothing 
to the free people in surrounding communities or to their own masters. While owners 
saw slaves exclusively as a source of muscle and work, many slaves and ex-slaves 
made it clear through their stories that for them family, community, faith, and the 
As this picture illustrates, slaves spent long hours in the fi elds surrounded by the cotton they were expected 
to cultivate and pick with no reward for their backbreaking labor.

hope for freedom were the highest priority. Studies of the advertisements for runaway 
slaves also made it clear that slaves never stopped running away no matter how far 
they might have to run. Similarly, small- and large-scale slave revolts never stopped. 
Cotton in the North—Factories and the People Who Worked in Them 
Th e technology that made cotton the core of the Industrial Revolution in the United 
States developed in England and North America during the 1700s. Just before the 
War of 1812, American Francis Cabot Lowell, who had spent 2 years working in and 
observing the British mills in Manchester, brought the technology he learned there 
to the United States. When he left Britain, customs agents searched his baggage to be 
sure he was not bringing with him drawings or plans from the British mills, which 
were a closely guarded national secret. But Lowell had simply been memorizing the 
plans. Like Slater, an Englishman who had transferred British secrets about mechanic 
spinning to Rhode Island mills in 1789, Lowell was ready to build a British-style mill 
in Massachusetts. Lowell also brought with him a second, equally important idea—the 
multishareholder corporation that could raise more money than any one individual 
could provide and could off er less risk to investors. 
Charles Ball was born a slave on a tobacco plantation in 
Maryland. He remembered his grandfather telling of being 
captured into slavery in Africa. After establishing his own family in 
Maryland, Ball was sold to a slave trader who in turn sold him to 
a cotton and rice plantation in Georgia. He never saw his home or 
family again. Half a century later, he escaped, hid on a ship bound 
for Philadelphia, and lived out his days in freedom. His autobiography, 
Fifty Years in Chains , was a popular publication among abolitionists—
those who supported the end of slavery. 
My master kept a store at a small village on the bank of the 
Patuxent River....Whilst I was eating in the kitchen, I observed him 
talking earnestly, but low, to a stranger near the kitchen door. 
I soon after went out, and hitched my oxen to the cart, and was 
about to drive off, when several men came round about me, and 
amongst them the stranger whom I had seen speaking with my 
master. This man came up to me, and, seizing me by the collar, 
shook me violently, saying I was his property, and must go with 
him to Georgia. At the sound of these words, the thoughts of my 
wife and children rushed across my mind, and my heart beat away 
within me. I saw and knew that my case was hopeless, and that 
resistance was vain, as there were near twenty persons present, all 
of whom were ready to assist the man by whom I was kidnapped. I 
felt incapable of weeping or speaking, and in my despair I laughed 
loudly. My purchaser ordered me to cross my hands behind, which 
were quickly bound with a strong cord; and he then told me that 
we must set out that very day for the South. I asked if I could not 
be allowed to go see my wife and children, or if this could not be 
permitted, if they might have leave to come to see me; but was 
told that I would be able to get another wife in Georgia. 
My new master, whose name I did not hear, took me that same 
day across the Patuxent, where I joined fifty-one other slaves.… 
A strong iron collar was closely fitted by means of a padlock 
round each of our necks. A chain of iron, about a hundred feet in 
length, was passed through the hasp of each padlock, except at 
the two ends, where the hasps of the padlock passed through a 
link of the chain.... 
Our master ordered a pot of mush to be made for our supper; 
after dispatching which all lay down on the naked floor to sleep 
in our handcuffs and chains. The women, my fellow-slaves, lay on 
one side of the room; and the men who were chained with me, 
occupied the other. I slept but little this night, which I passed in 
thinking of my wife and little children whom I could not hope 
ever to see again. I also thought of my grandfather, and of the 
long nights I had passed with him, listening to his narratives of 
the scenes through which he had passed in Africa.

In 1813, Lowell incorporated a new business with Patrick T. Jackson and Nathan 
Appleton: the Boston Manufacturing Company. Lowell and his mechanic, Paul 
Moody, recreated a British-style power loom in Massachusetts. With these steps, they 
established what would be the heart of American manufacturing for the next century: 
the multiowner corporation that produced cotton fabric in a large factory. 
Th e partners built their fi rst factory, or mill, at Waltham, Massachusetts, on the 
Charles River. After Lowell’s death in 1817, they then created a new city in 1823: 
Lowell, Massachusetts, that housed an even larger complex, using the 30-foot drop of 
the Merrimack River to power mills that could turn cotton into cloth for a domestic 
and international market at an astounding rate. Similar large operations sprang up on 
New Hampshire rivers in Manchester, Dover, and Nashua and on other Massachusetts 
rivers in Chicopee, Holyoke, and Lawrence. Where Samuel Slater’s mills in Rhode 
Island had been rather small, family aff airs, the factories and towns that Lowell and 
his colleagues built transformed the industry and the lives of the people involved 
in it. With the creation of Lowell as a new industrial city, the American Industrial 
Revolution was born. 
Th e Boston Associates needed workers for their giant looms and mills. Th ey turned 
fi rst to young women from the farms where most New Englanders still lived. More 
men than women had been heading west for decades, and New England had a surplus 
of young women. Farm life was hard, young women were kept in subservient positions, 
and the independence and the potential to earn their own money appealed to 
many young women. To avoid the squalid conditions of the English factories, Lowell 
and his colleagues built clean, company boarding houses for their female employees, 
complete with chaperones and opportunities for religious and educational activities. 
For the most part, they hired only single young women whose living conditions (and 
virtue) they could control (see Map 9-3 ). 
Th e young women who worked in Lowell’s mills in the early 1800s were known as 
“factory girls.” Lowell was a show town, and its owners published the Lowell Off ering 
to tell the world about the success of the venture and the good life the women who 
worked there enjoyed. Th e Lowell Off ering attracted new investors to the business and 
new young recruits to work in the mills. But life at Lowell and the other mill towns 
was less rosy than the Lowell Off ering reported. Conditions may have been better than 
in the “dark satanic mills” of Britain, but the work was hard, the hours long, and the 
conditions harsh. 
This idealized print of women working at their machines gives little hint of the noise, danger, and drudgery 
of 14-hour work days where a moment’s lack of attention could lead to a disaster.

A New Hampshire newspaper, the Dover Gazette, friendly to the factory girls, 
reported on an 1834 strike by the young women, one of the fi rst strikes in America: 
In consequence of the notice...[that] their wages would be reduced, to enable 
their employers to meet the “unusual pressure of the times,” the girls, to the 
number of between 600 and 700, assembled in the Court-House on Saturday 
aft ernoon, to devise ways and means to enable themselves to meet the “pressure 
of the times” anticipated from this threatened reduction. 
Th e fi rst strikes did not last long and did not win concessions. Th e company had too 
much power and the women too little. Still, news of the unrest tarnished the image of 
Lowell as a benevolent community run in the interests of its workers. A second strike 
2 years later—described by one of the participants in the following American Voices 
feature—also failed. 
By the 1840s, conditions had become much tougher in Lowell. Th e mill owners’ 
benevolence had worn off . Th e option of quitting and returning home, which had 
provided a way to escape the mill life during the 1830s, was disappearing because 
of an agricultural depression in New England. Young women stayed in Lowell, not 
necessarily because they wanted to, but because they had few other choices. Period 
publications like Th e Voice of Industry published their letters and articles, which 
described the challenges they faced and what hopes they had. One woman, known

only as Ada, shared these challenges and hopes in biblical terms that her peers 
would appreciate: 
“Do unto others, as ye would that they should do to you,” is a great precept, 
given to us by our great Teacher....What but the neglect of this great principle, 
has brought into the world all this confusion, this disorder, this isolated state of 
interest, between man and man; all this monopoly and competition in business? 
As the Industrial Revolution expanded, Ada would not be the last one to ask that 
question. 
New York and the International Cotton Trade 
As signifi cant as the mills of New England were in cotton production, most American 
cotton was shipped in its raw state to Manchester and Leeds in England. Th e permanent 
peace that had been established between the United States and Great Britain aft er the 
end of the War of 1812 made this trade easy. New York City became the center of the 
shipment of cotton across the Atlantic and, in the process, became the nation’s largest 
city and commercial center, a position it has retained ever since. 
New York City enjoyed several advantages that allowed it to play such a dominant 
role in the nation’s cotton economy, even though no cotton was grown within 
hundreds of miles of the city and few cotton mills were nearby. First, New York had 
an extraordinary deep-water harbor. Ships could dock directly in Manhattan and 
N I d t i N P liti Harriet H. Robinson worked in the cotton mills at Lowell from 
1835 to 1848. She was 10 when she began and left at age 
23 to be married. She published her story half a century later. The 
book, Loom and Spindle: Or Life Among the Early Mill Girls, remains 
a classic story of what life was like for the first generation of young 
women, most fresh from the farms, to take these jobs. 
The working-hours of all the girls extended from five o’clock 
in the morning until seven in the evening, with one-half hour for 
breakfast and for dinner.... 
One of the first strikes of cotton-factory operatives that ever 
took place in this country was that in Lowell, in October, 1836. 
When it was announced that the wages were to be cut down, 
great indignation was felt, and it was decided to strike, en mass. 
This was done. The mills were shut down, and the girls went in 
procession…and listened to “incendiary” speeches from early 
labor reformers. 
One of the girls stood on a pump, and gave vent to the feelings 
of her companions in a neat speech, declaring that it was 
their duty to resist all attempts at cutting down the wages. 
This was the first time a woman had spoken in public in Lowell, 
and the event caused surprise and consternation among her 
audience.... 
My own recollection of this first strike (or “turn out” as it was 
called) is very vivid. I worked in a lower room, where I had heard 
the proposed strike fully, if not vehemently, discussed; I had 
been an ardent listener to what was said against this attempt at 
“oppression” on the part of the corporation, and naturally I took 
sides with the strikers. When the day came on which the girls 
were to turn out, those in the upper rooms started first, and so 
many of them left that our mill was at once shut down. Then, 
when the girls in my room stood irresolute, uncertain what to do, 
asking each other, “Would you?” or “shall we turn out?” and not 
one of them having the courage to lead off, I, who began to think 
they would not go out, after all their talk, became impatient, and 
started on ahead, saying, with childish bravado, “I don’t care what 
you do, I am going to turn out, whether anyone else does or not;” 
and I marched out, and was followed by the others. 
As I looked back at the long line that followed me, I was more 
proud than I have ever been since at any success I may have 
achieved, and more proud than I shall ever be again until my own 
beloved State gives to its women citizens the right of suffrage.

Brooklyn without needing to anchor off shore and unload goods to smaller boats. Th e 
port was also easily accessible by coastal vessels from southern ports. As the production 
of cotton expanded aft er 1815, most of the South’s cotton was shipped north to New 
York and then reshipped either across the Atlantic to English ports or up Long Island 
Sound to Boston for the New England mills. Second, New York already had the infrastructure 
necessary to accommodate this level of shipping, including miles of docks 
and a community of merchants. Th ird, New York, an established port already, had 
experienced workers, including dockworkers and longshoremen (who handled cargo), 
to handle the hundreds of ships that did business there. Th e already large numbers of 
workers grew rapidly as New York (not counting Brooklyn, which was a separate city 
until 1898) grew six times its size between the American Revolution and 1820. In 1820, 
it mushroomed again from 125,000 residents, and to over 500,000 in 1850. 
New York businesses sent agents (called “factors”) to Charleston, South Carolina; 
Savannah, Georgia; Mobile, Alabama; and New Orleans to buy cotton for shipment 
to New York. In turn, the cotton was transferred from coastal ships to larger transatlantic 
ships that sailed to ports in England, racing each other to make the trip in the 
shortest amount of time. 
On the return trip from England, these ships brought cash from the sale of cotton and 
all sorts of British and European goods—iron and steel tools from Sheffi eld, England, 
wine from France, and manufactured goods that the United States needed and that could 
oft en be bought in New York for less than it cost to make them elsewhere in America. 
While American manufacturers disliked this reality, merchants from across the country 
fl ocked to New York to stock up on cheap goods, enhancing the city’s commerce. 
In 1818, shipping across the Atlantic was improved when a Quaker businessman, 
Jeremiah Th ompson, founded the Black Ball Line and established a fi xed schedule of 
weekly departures of fast ships from New York to Liverpool, England. Th e Black Ball 
Line announced that it had “undertaken to establish a line of vessels between NEW 
YORK and LIVERPOOL, to sail from each place on a certain day in every month 
through the year,” and printed the schedule. Until that time, commercial vessels 
waited to fi ll their holds with cargo, however long that took, before sailing. Now with 
the fi xed schedule, passengers and goods could be sure of leaving on time, and factories 
in England could be sure of a steady fl ow of cotton to keep their mills operating. 
Th e new ships were called packet ships because the line had a contract with the 
federal government to carry packets of U.S. mail. Th ese packet ships became a regular 
feature of world commerce and New York’s waterfront. Any packet ship captain who 
made the trip to Liverpool in under 22 days or the return trip to New York (which 
took longer because of less favorable winds) in under 35 days would be rewarded with 
a new coat and a dress for his wife, courtesy of Th ompson. Competition with the Black 
Ball Line soon developed, and the passenger cabins became elegant as diff erent lines 
competed for business. Shipwrights along New York’s East River changed the construction 
of new ships so they could make the voyage even more quickly than the 
original schedule. But most important, the Black Ball Line’s ships and its many competitors 
that emerged in the 1820s and 1830s ensured a steady supply of cotton for 
English mills and steady profi ts to U.S. cotton growers. 
New York was also the place in the United States to raise money. From the time 
Alexander Hamilton established the fi rst Bank of the United States in New York City 
in 1791, some New Yorkers grew rich fi nancing commercial activities that were far 
away from the city itself. Many farmers had long needed to borrow money for seed 
and fertilizer to plant a crop. Aft er industrialists like Francis Cabot Lowell began creating 
giant new corporations to build the factories for producing the cotton cloth 
that launched the industrial revolution, they too needed ways to borrow much larger 
amounts of money as well as longer periods of time to make profi ts and pay off the 
loans. Without such fi nancing, the Industrial Revolution would never have happened.

York Stock Exchange was founded in 1817, to support this large-scale commerce 
by allowing investors to pool funds and create new industries as well as commercial 
enterprises that were larger than any one person, even a rich one, could fund alone. 
New York was also home to many banks, investment houses, and insurance companies 
that helped fi nance the cotton industry. Nautilus Insurance Company wrote over 
300 life insurance policies on slaves, which protected the investments of plantation 
owners even if those policies did nothing for the slaves themselves. Th e investment 
house that became Brown Brothers, Harriman loaned millions of dollars to southern 
growers to fi nance the planting and shipping of cotton as well as the buying of slaves. 
At one point, the company owned three plantations and 346 slaves in Louisiana when 
owners defaulted on their loans. In general, however, New York fi nanciers made their 
profi ts in trade and commerce and kept their distance from the institution of slavery 
and the risks of cotton growing. Jeremiah Th ompson of the Black Ball Line made his 
fortune transporting slave-grown cotton, though as a Quaker, he opposed slavery itself. 
The extraordinary growth of cotton production in the South, the shipment of 
cotton within and beyond the United States, and the seemingly insatiable European 
demand for cotton cloth resulted in a rapid growth of the industry. In 1800, Great 
Britain imported 56 million pounds of raw cotton, 16 percent from the United States 
and most of the rest from India. Aft er an economic downturn that disrupted the entire 
industry and more, production once again began to pick up, and by 1830, Britain 
imported 264 million pounds of cotton, 77 percent from the United States, and by 
1840, 592 million pounds, 81 percent from the United States. Once again, the demand 
seemed endless, but many were now a bit wiser. 
With the development of the trans-Atlantic cotton trade and the opening of the Erie Canal, New York City 
grew rapidly in its commercial success. However, especially in hard times, the city was also plagued with 
areas of squalid poverty. Many New Yorkers lived in the most diffi cult conditions, especially in the notorious 
crime-fi lled Five Points neighborhood of Lower Manhattan.

The Panic of 1819 
Th e boom in the industry was not, as it turned out, a continual progression. As more 
Americans invested in land or slaves to grow cotton or in the commercial activities that 
fl owed from cotton, the optimism led them to become fi nancially overextend. Suddenly 
in 1819, the growth came to a sudden if temporary halt. Aft er 4 years of peace, Europe was 
growing more food, and a good harvest in 1818 meant less need for imported American 
grain. In addition, more raw cotton was being delivered to Liverpool than the mills could 
process, and new mills took time to build. Th e value of cotton fell from 32.5 cents a pound 
in October 1818 to 24 cents a pound in December. By early 1819, it was only 14 cents a 
pound. At that price, it was not profi table to grow cotton, to invest in land to plant more 
cotton, or to ship cotton either to New York or to Europe. 
Unfortunately, the Bank of the United States decided to protect itself by limiting 
credit and calling in loans. State banks followed suit, and investors and farmers could 
not pay their debts. Small businesses failed, farms were foreclosed, and people across 
the country lost their jobs. Th e great migration west came to a halt, at least for the time 
being, and the business cycle slowed dangerously. At the time, no one knew when 
or indeed if, prosperity would return. A national economy was a new thing in the 
United States, and it was not well understood. In earlier eras, what happened to New 
England shipping had little impact further south, and a crisis in southern tobacco 
never had much impact further north. By 1819, however, the nation’s economy was 
interconnected as never before and, as a result, a widespread depression aff ected all 
Americans. Th e boom-and-bust cycle of this young industrial economy was also new, 
and people were shocked. Eventually, the economy and the country recovered, but it 
took years and much hardship. In the middle of that fi rst national depression, however, 
Americans worried about the future. Th e price of cotton and the value of the 
cotton industry eventually rebounded and grew beyond anything imagined before the 
panic, but those successes would be at least partly tempered by what had happened. 
9.1 Quick Review Why did cotton come to be known as King Cotton in the early 1800s? 
COMMERCE, TECHNOLOGY, AND TRANSPORTATION 
Analyze the technological and fi nancial changes that led to the emergence of a new market 
economy in the United States. 
While cotton was the prime factor in the growth of the U.S. economy aft er 1815, it was not 
the only one. North American wheat and corn had been feeding Britain and continental 
Europe long before North American cotton began to clothe them. Trees from North 
American forests provided wood for ships and buildings on both sides of the Atlantic. 
North American furs remained in demand as they had been before the American 
Revolution. And as more Americans moved further into the interior, improvements in 
internal transportation became essential for the country’s commercial development. 
The Erie Canal 
The Hudson River offered easy north-south connections between New Yorkers 
in Manhattan and Brooklyn and farmers along the river valley up to Albany and 
beyond, but the heartland of New York State, far to the west of the Hudson, was isolated. 
Th e Mohawk River had never been navigable, and rural roads were in terrible 
shape. Th e treaties with the Iroquois aft er the American Revolution opened up tens 
of thousands of acres, many of them rich lands that white farmers could settle, but 
these farmers faced terrible isolation and diffi culty in selling their crops. Beginning in 
the 1790s, many New Yorkers wanted a way to ease transport across the state, but no

easy approach seemed possible. Indeed, Americans throughout the rest of the growing 
country had similar needs—and a similar lack of know-how. 
After Congress refused to fund a canal linking rural upstate New York with the 
Hudson Valley, former New York City Mayor DeWitt Clinton ran for governor in 
1816 with a promise to build a canal using state funds. Th e canal that Clinton proposed 
avoided the hard-to-navigate Mohawk River and Lake Ontario (using the lake would 
have lowered construction costs but risked diverting trade to Canada). Instead, he proposed 
a canal that would follow an old Mohawk Indian trading route (the governor 
knew his New York history) and run from the Hudson Valley directly to Buff alo on Lake 
Erie. Such a canal would give farmers along its route a link to markets and would connect 
all of New York state to the growing Ohio region and eventually to the Mississippi 
River. It would make New York City the commercial capital of the nation. 
Th e plan called for an unimaginable engineering feat. Th omas Jeff erson called it 
“madness.” Th e canal needed a series of locks to raise and lower water to accommodate 
changes in elevation of 565 feet. The United States had few engineers, and no one 
really knew how to build such locks. Th e longest canal in the country at that time was 
only 26 miles, less than one-tenth of the projected plan. None of those problems discouraged 
Clinton or the canal’s backers. When the anti-Clinton faction, led by Martin 
Van Buren, realized how much enthusiasm there was for the canal, they ended their 
opposition, and the project quickly moved through the state legislature. 
At dawn on July 4, 1817, a gala ground-breaking celebration was held at Rome, 
New York, when the symbolic fi rst shovel of dirt was dug to build the Erie Canal , a 
manmade waterway that would extend 363 miles between Albany and Buff alo and contain 
a total of 83 locks. Clinton was a wily politician. He made sure that many diff erent 
Erie Canal 
Completed in 1825, the canal linked the 
Hudson River with the Great Lakes and gave 
farmers all along its route new ways to be 
part of a global economic system of trade. 
The Erie Canal crossed rural New York State, connecting villages all along the way. Travelers needed to keep 
their heads down when traveling under bridges and wait as locks raised and lowered boats, but the canal 
boats provided transport at a speed unimagined before it was built.

9.3 
contractors got a piece of the action digging the canal. He built political support by 
ensuring that up to three-quarters of the 9,000 men who did the actual digging were 
Dutch or English farmers and laborers from New York State and future Clinton voters. 
As soon as the section near Rome was completed, Clinton used the revenue it 
generated to cover the interest on the $7 million in bonds that had been fl oated to pay 
for the canal, reducing the cost to taxpayers. 
Clinton found contractors willing to experiment with new approaches to construction. 
In one section, near the town of Lockport, locks needed to be constructed to raise 
and lower the boats over changing elevations. Contractors used gunpowder to blast 
out the rock, and horses hauled away the debris. By 1825, the canal, four-feet deep and 
40-feet wide, was completed. Governor Clinton traveled from Buff alo across the state 
on the canal and then down the Hudson to mark the offi cial opening by pouring water 
from Lake Erie into New York Harbor. 
Many admired the engineering of the canal and many more enjoyed its economic 
impact. Goods and exports that had cost $100 a ton to ship from Lake Erie to New 
York City before the canal now shipped for $9, or even $3, a ton. Farmers in distant 
upstate New York and in Ohio could get their wheat to international markets through 
New York Harbor. Formerly isolated farm families could now send letters and even 
visit friends and relatives. Th ey could also import goods that had earlier been unimaginable 
luxuries because they had been too heavy or perishable to transport. A newspaper 
in Batavia, New York, celebrated the arrival of “Oysters! Beautiful Oysters,” 
from Long Island to a town where fresh seafood had never been available. Farmers 
and small town residents now could not only eat sea food but also buy a clock for their 
wall, a mattress for their bed, or curtains for their home at a fraction of the price these 
goods had cost before the canal opened. By the 1830s, the Erie Canal carried more 
than twice the freight of the Mississippi River, and Rochester, Syracuse, and Buff alo 
boomed. Where cotton had made New York City the nation’s commercial center, 
foodstuff s and other products from upstate New York and even western Pennsylvania 
and Ohio now cemented the city’s role as the place where the nation’s trade, commerce, 
and fi nance met. Other shorter canals were built in many other parts of the 
country, but none had the commercial impact of the Erie Canal. 
Steamboats, Roads, Travel, and News 
Erie Canal boats were pulled by horses walking along the bank. Th e packet ships that 
crossed the Atlantic were powered by sail as ships had been for thousands of years. 
But the invention of the steamboat revolutionized water transportation. In 1807, 
Robert Fulton built the fi rst commercially successful steamboat, the Clermont , which 
signifi cantly cut the travel time from New York to Albany. Within 2 decades, New York 
Harbor and adjacent areas had become a hive of steamboat activity for both commerce 
and passengers, and many steamboat lines competed for the trade, none more 
successfully than the line Cornelius Vanderbilt owned. 
Steamboats also transformed trade on the Mississippi River. In the early 1800s, farmers 
fl oated down the river on large riverboats with their goods and then sold the boats for 
lumber when they reached their destination and walked or rode horses home. Steamboats, 
however, could travel up the river against the current. In 1817, a steamer went from New 
Orleans to Louisville, Kentucky, in 25 days, an unheard-of speed. In less than a decade, 
the travel time had been cut to 8 days as faster boats competed for the Mississippi River 
business and became a colorful part of America in the 1800s (see Map 9-4 ). 
In certain areas, water transport was the fastest and easiest way to travel through 
and around the United States, but roads were also important. In 1802, Congress 
authorized the use of funds from the sale of government lands in Ohio to build a gravel 
road to the interior of the country. Beginning in 1811, at Cumberland, Maryland, the 
National Road was built across the Appalachian Mountains. When it reached its original 
terminus at Wheeling, Virginia (aft er the Civil War, West Virginia), in 1818, it

not only had crossed the mountains but also had linked the Potomac River with the 
Ohio River, which fl owed into the Mississippi, and from there to the Gulf of Mexico. 
Later, slowly, the National Road was extended across Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, 
connecting to the Mississippi River itself. While many, notably Jeff erson’s Secretary 
of the Treasury Albert Gallatin, argued for more federally financed construction, 
Presidents Jeff erson, Madison, and Monroe—all three advocates of a small federal 
government—doubted whether the national government could fi nance such undertakings 
without an amendment to the Constitution. Th ose three were also Virginians, 
and Virginia, with a long coastline, benefi ted more from coastal shipping than from 
canals or roads. On occasion, they put their doubts aside and signed bills providing

federal funding for specifi c projects, but none of those who lived in the White House 
between 1801 and 1825 were enthusiastic about federal support for a transportation 
infrastructure for the nation. 
In addition, states built their own roads, like the Lancaster Turnpike across 
Pennsylvania, but travel by road was slow and expensive throughout the 1820s and 
1830s. A stagecoach could travel 6–8 miles an hour on a good road—11 on the best 
road between New York and Philadelphia. Wagons could haul goods as far as the next 
river or canal. Tollbooths collected fees to pay for the roads, but on a poor road in the 
wilderness, it was easy to detour around the tollbooth. Until railroads arrived in the 
1840s, proximity to a canal, river, or the Atlantic and Gulf coasts was essential for 
the productive commerce in goods and services. People who lived near land or water 
routes for transport were able to get their goods to market, receive newspapers, and stay 
connected to an increasingly national economy and culture. Th ose who lived farther 
away from such transportation lived isolated lives—all the more isolated as others 
became more connected. 
With increased speed in travel, news also moved more quickly (see Table 9-1 ). 
Packet ships from Liverpool brought European news, and as the ships cut trans-Atlantic 
travel time from 50 days in 1816 to 42 days in the 1820s, that news traveled faster. 
Within the United States, by 1817, a man on a horse could bring news from New York 
to Philadelphia or Boston in 2 days. A steamboat traveling through Long Island Sound 
could also bring the news to coastal cities in Connecticut and to Boston in about the 
same amount of time. For southern coastal cities, the travel time was slower, and for 
inland towns, much slower. Newspapers sprang up across the country, and the federal 
government developed an extensive post offi ce system (since the Constitution clearly 
sanctioned the post offi ce and post roads) that helped Americans connect for personal 
and business matters. Th e packet ships, stagecoaches, and canal boats also depended 
on contracts with the federal post offi ce to make their routes profi table. Commercial 
leaders and traders on the New York Stock Exchange were anxious to have the latest 
news, especially about crops, but also about European and American demand for 
goods. Th ey supported the post offi ce and newspapers as essential for the growing, 
unifi ed market economy. 
While steamships like Robert Fulton’s Clermont made for easy and fast travel up the Hudson River and along other 
rivers around the nation they were limited to water transport, while stage coaches, which were much slower, were 
essential for travel over the country’s poorly constructed roads until replaced on many routes by railroads..

9.3 
Banks, Corporations, and Finance 
In the early years of the Republic many Americans harbored deep distrust of large 
business enterprises. Th e family farm was the business model with which most people 
were familiar, and other businesses were expected to be small, individual or family 
ventures. People might join together to fi nance a voyage or a project, but these eff orts 
were short-term partnerships. At the time of the American Revolution, there were only 
seven American corporations, each chartered by colonial legislatures. State legislatures 
chartered 40 more corporations in the 1780s and some 300 in the 1790s, but gaining a 
corporate charter remained diffi cult. In general, such charters were given only to colleges 
or other nonprofi t agencies to serve the public good. Commerce was considered 
as being for individual gain and therefore not something worthy of a state charter. 
Some of the fi rst corporations were banks. Congress had chartered the nation’s 
fi rst bank, the Bank of North America, at Hamilton’s urging in 1781. By 1815, the 
United States had 200 state-chartered banks. Banks offered two essential services. 
First, they printed paper currency—bank notes—that were backed by the bank’s gold 
and silver deposits (known as specie), making commercial transactions much easier 
than hauling actual gold and silver around. Second, banks also made loans and collected 
interest, making funds available to people who wanted to develop a new enterprise 
and making the banks themselves profi table investments. Soon, banks also began 
to issue bank notes not only on the species they held but also on the loans in their 
portfolio. Th is development made banking more risky but expanded the amount of 
money in circulation and the credit available, essential elements in the growth of a 
commercial republic. 
As commerce developed, however, larger commercial and industrial ventures, 
like the mills at Lowell, were too large and risky to be fi nanced solely by individuals, 
even if those individuals could secure large bank loans. A new idea, that of a corporation 
as a free-standing commercial venture with multiple stockholders, took hold 
slowly. Two key elements in a corporation—limited liability for individual stockholders 
and the corporation’s freedom from having its charter withdrawn or altered 
by the government—were new in the United States. Individually owned businesses 
came and went, but corporations with their many stockholders and secure charters 
eventually became a permanent and important feature of American economic life 
aft er 1815. 
The Reality of the New Market Economy 
In 1819, Washington Irving, already a well-known author, published Rip Van Winkle . 
The story has entertained generations of readers, but it captured the changes in 
the United States in the fi rst decades of independence. In the story, Rip, a lazy fellow 
living in New York’s Catskill Mountains, takes a nap in the woods on a fi ne fall 
day. He awakes 20 years later and fi nds everything has changed in his home village.

Th e picture on the sign over the inn was of someone named “General Washington” 
instead of King George III, but even more surprising, the whole town was diff erent: 
The very village was altered; it was larger and more populous. There were 
rows of houses which he had never seen before, and those which had been 
his familiar haunts had disappeared....Th e very character of the people seemed 
changed. Th ere was a busy, bustling, disputatious tone about it, instead of the 
accustomed phlegm and drowsy tranquility. 
Rip had been a passive subject of King George III. When he awoke, he was a citizen in 
an independent country that took politics, voting, and political parties very seriously. 
When he was asked whether he “was Federal or Democrat,” Rip was equally at a loss. 
But Irving was saying something more about the decades aft er the Revolution—that 
“the very character of the people seemed changed.” Where once rural America had 
moved to a relaxed, slow pace, the whole country was now a more unifi ed commercial 
enterprise in which a “busy, bustling, disputatious tone” was the norm because people 
needed to work and work fast. 
There were many real-life Rip Van Winkles who, while not necessarily having 
the benefi t of a 20-year nap, still came to live in an adult world utterly diff erent 
from that of their youth. Ichabod Washburn was born in the small town of Kingston, 
Massachusetts, in 1798. His widowed mother supported the family with a loom in her 
home. When his mother could not feed her whole family, Washburn was “put out” to 
work as a harness maker and told that a boy should not ask too many questions about 
the world around him. Later, he found work in one of the factories that were springing 
up around New England and then founded his own business. Washburn & Moen 
Wire Manufactory became the largest wire maker in the country, sending its products 
all over the world and making Washburn a rich man. Not all Americans became as 
rich as Washburn, but many people in many parts of the land moved from isolated 
family businesses to work in large nationally and internationally connected industries. 
Th ey went from a slow-paced world of barter to a cash economy based on trade, and 
they moved from rural isolation to participate in the exchange of information within 
a much larger world. 
The growing economy and the revolution in transportation only increased demand for the nation’s raw 
materials such as lumber, which new machinery made easy to cut into standard-sized boards for shipment 
and use in building houses and ships.

Before the American Revolution, most farmers lived in a barter economy in which 
most goods and services were simply traded. In that economy, life moved at a slow 
and predictable pace, and little money was transacted. By the 1820s, the barter economy 
had disappeared in all but the most remote areas. Farmers sold their goods on 
the world market and used the cash they received to purchase not only necessities but 
also, oft en, luxuries that their pre-Revolutionary forbearers never imagined. 
To many Americans—not just to national leaders—distances seemed shorter, 
money more important, and politics more omnipresent aft er 1815 than one would 
have thought possible even a few years before. Visitors to remote farm settlements 
in Illinois in the 1820s found that cloth coats and calico dresses purchased from a 
trader or a store were replacing homespun and buckskin. Once one family made the 
shift , everyone in the village felt pressure to earn enough money to keep up. As people 
worked harder and longer, public clocks—with an added hand that noted minutes, 
not just the passage of the hours—became more prominent. Chauncey Jerome’s 
Connecticut clock company made a fortune manufacturing and shipping clocks to 
every part of the nation. As one 1840 traveler reported, “In every dell of Arkansas, 
and in cabins where there was not a chair to sit on, there was sure to be a Connecticut 
clock.” Rip Van Winkle was not the only one waking up in a diff erent time and in a 
money-conscious country.

Quick Review How did new trading routes progressively improve the U.S. economy and, in 
doing so, change the United States? 
FROM THE ERA OF GOOD FEELINGS TO THE POLITICS OF DIVISION 
Explain the political developments in the United States during the 1820s, including the shift of 
power toward the South and West that resulted from the changing economic situation. 
James Monroe’s two terms as president from 1817 to 1825 were known as the Era of 
Good Feelings because of the lack of rancor in his virtually unanimous election and 
reelection during a time when the opposing Federalist Party had almost disappeared. 
Th e period was quite a change from the days when John Adams and Th omas Jeff erson 
contested the presidency and Federalists and Democratic-Republicans fought in the 
press and on the fl oor of Congress. But even during the Era of Good Feelings, all was 
not calm on the political front. Th e Supreme Court was rapidly expanding its reach 
and the reach of the federal government into new aspects of the country. In addition, 
political tensions over the cotton economy, territorial expansion, and slavery exploded 
with surprising force in the 1820s. Th e good feelings were not destined to last. 
The Supreme Court Defi nes Its Place 
John Marshall served as chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court from 1801 to 1835. 
Throughout his long tenure on the Court, Marshall was usually able to convince a 
majority of the justices to go along with his views no matter what their prior political 
beliefs were. He used his position to defi ne the role of the court as arbiter of the 
Constitution, and he expanded the role and power of the federal government in many 
aspects of national life. 
Early in his tenure, Marshall’s 1803 Marbury v. Madison decision claimed a role 
for the Supreme Court in reviewing the constitutionality of acts of Congress. Marshall 
never again invoked that right, but in a series of subsequent decisions, he created the 
same right for the court in relationship to state legislatures and state courts. Two 1819 
decisions from the Marshall court were especially important in expanding the role of 
the Supreme Court and the federal government.

9.3 
In an appeal to the Supreme Court in the case of Dartmouth College v. Woodward 
(1819), the old Federalist Marshall reviewed a decision by lower courts that began 
when the Democratic-Republican-dominated New Hampshire legislature revised the 
original charter of Dartmouth College, converting the school from a private to a state 
college. Th e Supreme Court ruled that state charters, including charters from colonial 
legislatures like Dartmouth’s, were contracts and that contracts, once agreed to, were 
inviolable; thus, the legislature’s actions were unconstitutional. Th e case was important 
not only because it asserted the right of the Supreme Court to review the actions 
of state legislatures, not just Congress, but also because it asserted the inviolability 
of contracts. As a result, it became an important bedrock of the American economic 
system. Aft er the Dartmouth College decision, the nation’s growing businesses and 
industries were able to be certain that their contracts, once agreed to, could not be 
overturned by legislative action. 
The other important 1819 decision was McCulloch v. Maryland . Congress had 
chartered the Second Bank of the United States at the end of the War of 1812 to stabilize 
the nation’s fi nances. But the bank was not popular with many people, especially 
farmers and others who saw it as an instrument of the commercial elite. In response 
to the general opposition to the bank and to charges of irregularities in the bank’s 
Maryland branch, the state of Maryland imposed a tax on the bank as a way to drive it 
out of business, or at least out of Maryland. In response, the bank brought suit in the 
federal courts and the case worked its way up to the Supreme Court. In the decision, 
written by Marshall, the court took Alexander Hamilton’s view that the “necessary and 
proper” clause of the Constitution meant that Congress had the right to charter a bank 
if it thought it was in the national interest, despite the Tenth Amendment’s mandate 
that states should retain any power that was not specifi cally delegated to the national 
government in the Constitution. Marshall went further, saying that “the power to tax 
involves the power to destroy” while the “power to create” that Congress had invoked 
in the case of the bank, “implies a power to preserve.” Th e issue Marshall referred 
to was not obscure. With McCulloch v. Maryland, the Supreme Court declared that 
states could not interfere with the workings of the federal government. 
Th e Marshall Court continued to expand federal authority in subsequent cases. 
In Gibbons v. Ogden (1824), the court ruled that the state of New York did not have 
a right to give Ogden, a partner of Robert Fulton, a monopoly to ferry service in 
New York harbor since the harbor connected New York and New Jersey and thus 
involved interstate commerce, which only Congress could control. Later, in Worcester 
v. Georgia (1832), the court ruled that the state of Georgia could not regulate private 
dealings by U.S. citizens within the territory controlled by the Cherokee tribe since 
tribes had their own sovereign rights, subject only to the authority of the federal government. 
In these and other decisions, the court affi rmed what came to be known 
as a “loose construction” of the Constitution, which as Marshall explained, enabled 
the Constitution “to be adapted to the various crises of human aff airs” to preserve 
its relevance through time. Not everyone agreed with Marshall’s perspective, and 
when he died in 1835, a Democratic-Republican paper did not mourn “the political 
doctrines” of a justice who sought “to strengthen government at the expense of the 
people.” Nevertheless, many felt that both the Constitution and the rights of people 
were stronger for his eff orts. 
The Politics of Cotton and the Missouri Compromise of 1820 
Although Missouri was too far north to be a cotton-growing state, its population 
also grew as a result of America’s westward movement, and by 1819 Missouri applied 
to Congress to be admitted as a new state. A bill to authorize a state constitutional 
convention was introduced in Congress with little fanfare early in 1819. However, 
Congressman James Tallmadge, Jr., of New York introduced an amendment to the

Missouri statehood bill to prohibit the introduction of new slaves into the state and 
gradually free those who were already there. Tallmadge’s amendment created a huge 
crisis in which southern representatives and senators attacked it and its author. 
In language that prefi gured the heated debates of the next four decades, Georgia 
Representative Th omas W. Cobb told Tallmadge, “You have kindled a fi re which all 
the waters of the ocean cannot put out, which seas of blood can only extinguish.” 
Tallmadge responded in kind: “If a dissolution of the Union must take place, let it be so! 
If civil war, which gentlemen so much threaten, must come, I can only say, let it come.” 
Th reats of disunion were as old as the Constitutional Convention of 1787, but this language 
was harsher than Congress had heard in a long time. Th e reasons were clear. 
When the Constitution was adopted, many from both the South and the North 
believed that slavery was dying; even its defenders tended to describe the institution 
as a sad though necessary evil. When George Washington and others of his generation 
freed their slaves, the economic impact was limited since slaves were not of great 
value. But that period was before cotton transformed the economics of slavery. A slave 
in the prime of life who might be sold for $400 or $500 in 1814 could be sold for $800– 
$1,100 in 1819, and though the price of slaves, as of land, decreased with the panic of 
1819, values in both cases recovered and then kept rising. Slaves had become valuable, 
whether as workers or as “products” to be sold. If Virginia and Carolina planters could 
not use all the slaves they owned, instead of freeing them, they could now sell them to 
cotton growers in Georgia, Mississippi, and Alabama at a substantial profi t. Missouri 
had few slaves, but by 1820, slave owners were not about to allow an attack on the 
institution of slavery. Although much of the debate about Missouri was spoken in the 
language of popular will and the sovereign right of (white) people there to decide their 
own policies, it took place as economic and racial realities were changing quickly. 
In the North, hostility to slavery was growing. Many northerners, including 
many whose pre-Revolutionary parents and grandparents had owned slaves, now 
hated the whole idea of human slavery and disliked a constitutional system that protected 
it. Even before 1820, some people were starting to call themselves abolitionists—
those committed to completely ending slavery. Many other northerners had 
more strategic objections to the constitutional protection of slavery. Th e three-fi ft hs 
clause in the Constitution gave the slaveholding South 17 more seats in the House of 
Representatives and, thus, 17 more electoral votes in presidential elections than an 
allocation of representatives based on only free people would have done. As a result, 
four of the fi ve U.S. presidents who had served by 1820 had come from Virginia. Th e 
nation was becoming divided between a commercial North and an agricultural South, 
and although neither region was purely for or against slavery, the fact that slavery gave 
the South a political edge came across to many northerners as being unfair. 
Th e debates about Missouri, despite all the anger voiced by Tallmadge and Cobb, 
were not as vitriolic as future debates would be. Th ere were not yet many radical abolitionists 
in the North, and so far, few in the South were saying that slavery was a positive 
good. But already in 1819, neither side would back down, and Congress adjourned 
without doing anything about Missouri. 
Before Congress reassembled in 1820, President Monroe and Henry Clay of 
Kentucky, the speaker of the House of Representatives, designed a compromise to 
resolve the issue. While the North had a solid and growing majority in the House, the 
Senate was evenly divided between slave and free states. Since each state had two senators 
no matter what its population, 11 free states and 11 slave states meant a Senate 
that was split 22-22 on the issue of slavery. In addition, while Congress had debated 
what to do about Missouri, the region known as the District of Maine, within the 
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, was also petitioning for statehood with the blessing 
of the Massachusetts legislature. Th e compromise proposed that if Maine and Missouri 
were admitted at the same time, and if Missouri was allowed to be a slave state, then 
the balance in the Senate would be maintained. However, this proposed compromise 
9.1 
9.3

9.2 
would also restrict the spread of slavery: while Missouri would be admitted as a slave 
state, all other states north of the 36˚ 30˚ north parallel, that is, the southern border of 
Missouri, would be admitted as free states. Although most northerners in the House 
and Senate voted against it, some supported the compromise, as did almost all of those 
from the South, and the Missouri Compromise passed Congress, allowing Missouri 
and Maine to be admitted to the Union. The crisis had been averted. The success 
would be the fi rst of many such compromises for which Henry Clay would become 
known as the “great compromiser” over the next 3 decades. However, the need for this 
compromise signaled more clearly than ever before that slavery had become a divisive 
issue that would not go away (see Map 9-5 ). 
The Contested Election of 1824 
As President Monroe came to the end of his second term, the political good will that 
had marked his tenure disappeared. Although no constitutional limitation had yet 
been set on presidential terms, Washington had set a precedent for stepping down aft er 
two terms, which others had followed. In 1824, as the nation sought a new president,

the United States experienced one of the most contested and confusing presidential 
elections in its history. For citizens of a nation that had elected James Monroe almost 
unanimously in 1816 and 1820, the ill will of 1824 was a surprise. 
In one sense, the election of 1824 proceeded just as the writers of the Constitution— 
who hated the idea of political parties—envisioned: a contest in which members of 
the House, with each state’s delegation having one vote, would decide on a president 
from among several of the nation’s leading citizens who had been identifi ed by the 
votes of the Electoral College. With the demise of the Federalists, the Democratic- 
Republican Party was the only party in the nation. It had been as that party’s candidate 
that Monroe had been elected by an almost unanimous vote since the Federalists 
did not nominate a candidate in 1820 or anytime aft er that. 
By 1824, however, the usual process in which a party caucus within Congress would 
select a presidential nominee had broken down, and three members of Monroe’s cabinet 
along with the speaker of the House of Representatives all sought the presidency. 
A fifth candidate from the same Democratic-Republican Party, Senator Andrew 
Jackson, the national war hero from Tennessee, also joined the race. In this type of 
contest, personal animosity and political intrigue were inevitable. 
At fi rst, many thought Secretary of the Treasury William H. Crawford of Georgia 
was the obvious choice. Crawford had stepped out of the way to support Monroe’s 
election, and he and many of his supporters thought it was now his turn. Th e congressional 
caucus that traditionally nominated presidential candidates, in fact, did choose 
Crawford. However, in what was clearly a warning of trouble to come, less than a fourth 
of the members of Congress showed up to vote in the caucus. Others, in Congress and 
outside of it, would fi nd other candidates and other ways to support them. 
Secretary of State John Quincy Adams of Massachusetts had a good claim to consideration. 
Many considered the offi ce of secretary of state as the natural stepping stone 
to the presidency. Monroe had been Madison’s secretary of state as Madison had been 
When he heard about the Missouri Compromise, the 
aging Thomas Jefferson, who had been infuriated by the 
Tallmadge amendment because it interfered with the rights of 
states, wrote to John Holmes, a Massachusetts congressman: 
I had for a long time ceased to read the newspapers or pay 
any attention to public affairs, confident they were in good 
hands, and content to be a passenger in our bark to the shore 
from which I am not distant. But this momentous question, 
like a fire bell in the night, awakened and filled me with terror. 
I considered it at once as the knell of the Union. It is hushed 
indeed for the moment. But this is a reprieve only, not a final 
sentence. A geographical line, coinciding with a marked principle, 
moral and political, once conceived and held up to the 
angry passions of men, will never be obliterated; and every 
new irritation will mark it deeper and deeper. 
While Clay was being hailed as a national hero for crafting the 
compromise, Jefferson, perhaps, had a better sense of what lay 
ahead. The former president and slaveholder who also wrote 
passionately against slavery knew that, in the long term, no issue 
would so greatly divide the nation’s citizens, and as he grew old, 
he saw the division become increasingly intense. 
Thinking Critically 
1. Contextualization 
How would you characterize pro- and antislavery forces in 
1820? What might explain the widespread belief that the 
issue of slavery had been resolved with the passage of the 
Missouri Compromise? 
2. Historical Interpretation 
In hindsight, it is clear that Jefferson was correct and the 
Missouri Compromise was only a “reprieve.” What evidence 
was available in 1820 to support Jefferson’s point of view? 
What trends had already begun to emerge that would lead 
the intensification of the conflict over slavery in the decades 
to come?

Jeff erson’s, and Jeff erson had been Washington’s. In addition, Adams had served the 
nation well. He had acquired Florida for the United States, arranged treaties that opened 
vast new lands to settlement, and handled South American revolutions and potential 
European interference skillfully. As a former ambassador, senator, son of a former president, 
and favorite of the antislavery North, Adams had much going for him. 
Secretary of War John C. Calhoun from South Carolina was another candidate. 
Calhoun had not yet become the fi erce advocate of states’ rights that he was later. In 
1824, he was a strong nationalist. He advocated for a strong army and for using army 
engineers to conduct a national survey that would lead to federally supported roads, 
bridges, and canals connecting all parts of the nation. He also supported the Bank of 
the United States. Calhoun initially backed Adams, but when he became convinced 
aft er the Missouri crisis that southern and border state electors would never support a 
New Englander, his own ambition was fi red up and he campaigned actively. 
Henry Clay of Kentucky, also a contender, was speaker of the House of 
Representatives and an ardent nationalist. Like Calhoun, he supported an expansive 
federal government that controlled the currency through a strong national bank and 
that built roads and bridges as well as supported commerce. From his political base in 
Kentucky, Clay hoped to be the fi rst president from west of the Alleghenies. He was 
also shrewd enough to guess that with so many candidates in the race, the House of 
Representatives, which he controlled, might make the fi nal decision. 
Finally, there was Andrew Jackson of Tennessee. At fi rst, Jackson seemed an unlikely 
candidate for president. Unlike any president aft er Washington, Jackson had never 
served in the cabinet or represented the nation abroad. Instead, he was the hero of the 
Battle of New Orleans. He had served for 1 year in the Senate and in other government 
posts, but his primary public role was as a military leader, and in the 1820s, the military 
was not always a popular institution. His wife, Rachel Jackson, strongly opposed his 
seeking the presidency. In 1822, however, the Tennessee legislature formally nominated 
Jackson as a candidate for president, primarily as a way to block the then frontrunner 
Crawford. At that point, Jackson probably supported Adams, in part, because Adams 
had supported Jackson’s actions in Florida, while Crawford and Clay had not. 
No one, including Jackson, counted on how popular he would be with the electorate. 
When a tavern keeper in Pennsylvania wrote, asking whether Jackson would 
indeed seek the presidency, the canny general, knowing that his response would be 
published, replied that it was his “undeviating rule neither to seek or decline public 
invitations to offi ce.” His response seemed the height of statesmanship to a country 
that had seen Monroe’s almost unanimous election in the Era of Good Feelings 
replaced by a divisive contest for the presidency. 
Th e Constitution allows each state to decide how to choose presidential electors. By 
1824, most states allowed voters to select electors pledged to a specifi c candidate, thus 
greatly democratizing the presidential selection process. Th at electorate had changed 
since the Constitution was adopted in 1789. Since 1808 when New Jersey retracted 
its decision to give women the right to vote, only men voted. Property restrictions on 
voting, still common when Washington was elected, were long gone in most states, 
so nearly all white men could now vote, and in some northern states, so could free 
black men. In New York City, free blacks sometimes held the balance of power among 
various factions. Excluded from voting were women of all races, most blacks including 
all slaves, and Indians. Nevertheless, this broad male electorate valued widespread 
popularity as more important in selecting a president than the voice of a few members 
of the social and economic elite. By 1824, the (white male) popular will was coalescing 
behind Jackson far more than anyone expected. 
In a nation increasingly divided by sectional issues, a nationally respected war 
hero had great appeal. In addition, a fierce opponent of banks like Jackson was 
popular with many people who were convinced—at least partially rightly—that the 
Bank of the United States had brought on the panic of 1819. In places like Mississippi

9.2 
and Alabama where some people were growing rich on farmlands that Jackson had 
wrested from their Indian owners, he was a local hero. Particularly in a country where 
an elite’s economic decisions had hurt many farmers and workers, a candidate who 
had been born in a log cabin and grown up poor, though he had become wealthy as an 
adult, had deep appeal. Popular appeal had not been a major factor in the elections of 
Madison and Monroe, but it was the factor in 1824. 
In the 1824 election, Jackson won the popular vote. Calhoun, who had withdrawn 
from the campaign aft er deciding that Jackson was too popular to beat, was easily 
elected as vice president since the Twelft h Amendment, ratifi ed in 1804 in the aft ermath 
of the Jeff erson-Burr fi asco, mandated that presidential electors cast separate 
ballots for presidential and vice presidential candidates. In addition to Pennsylvania, 
Jackson easily carried the black-belt states of Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and 
Louisiana as well as most of the rest of the South, a region benefi tting from its population 
of nonvoting slaves, which strengthened its electoral votes as a result of the threefi 
ft hs clause to the Constitution. Jackson defeated Adams in New Jersey, Crawford in 
North Carolina, and Clay in Indiana and Illinois. Adams carried New England, some 
of the mid-Atlantic region, and the Northwest. However, although Jackson won the 
most popular votes, no one had the 131 electoral votes needed for a majority: 
Jackson 99 electoral votes 
Adams 84 electoral votes 
Crawford 41 electoral votes 
Clay 37 electoral votes 
Clay’s prediction was right; the election had been tossed into the House of 
Representatives. Not since 1800 had the House of Representatives been called on to 
decide the outcome of a presidential contest. 
Ironically, however, since the Constitution required the House to choose from 
among the top three candidates, Clay himself had been eliminated. Moreover, 
although his supporters had kept it hidden, Crawford had had a stroke and could not 
possibly assume the presidency. So the election came down to Jackson and Adams, 
and Adams was determined to fi ght for the offi ce, despite ranking second in the popular 
and electoral votes. Th e Constitution mandated a process, and Adams wanted 
to follow it. Many of Adams’s followers, and the supporters of other candidates, saw 
Jackson as a would-be American Napoleon who would undermine American democracy. 
No one held that concern more strongly than Henry Clay—who was master of 
the House and determined that Jackson should not be president. When the House met 
on February 9, 1825, Adams was elected president by a vote of 13 states, with seven 
states for Jackson and four for Crawford. 
On the evening of the vote, outgoing President Monroe held a party at the White 
House. Jackson approached Adams, and they greeted each other with considerable 
formality. Observers thought Jackson was “genial and gracious,” while Adams was 
“stiff , rigid, cold as a statue.” Th e two would not oft en meet again, but the interaction 
that night imprinted an image on the public that would follow them, to Jackson’s benefi 
t, for the next 4 years and beyond. 
Whether Adams had made any secret agreement with Clay will never be known. 
But 5 days aft er the vote, Adams appointed Clay to be his secretary of state and thus 
his successor if the previous pattern held true. Jackson denounced both men for 
making a “corrupt bargain,” resigned from the Senate, and returned to his home in 
Nashville to begin what was essentially a 4-year campaign against Adams, Clay, and 
their administration, as well as a campaign for his own election to the offi ce that he 
and his followers believed he had won in 1824. Adams and Clay had underestimated 
the popular feeling for Jackson. Th e animosity of the campaign and Jackson’s rancor 
would make the next 4 years diffi cult for an administration led by two of the nation’s 
most gift ed political and diplomatic leaders.

9.2 
The Adams-Clay Agenda 
In his inaugural address in March 1825, Adams acknowledged that he came to the 
presidency, “less possessed of your confi dence in advance than any of my predecessors.” 
Nevertheless, it was his goal to unify the nation and improve all parts of the 
country. He was the last president to believe that the “baneful weed of party strife” 
might be avoided, and he struggled—unsuccessfully—to avoid the creation of political 
parties and permanent national divisions. 
Adams proposed a list of national improvements to be implemented by the federal 
government. Support for federally funded improvements such as roads, canals, 
and so on would be a hallmark of the Adams administration. An emerging political 
faction that supported national development and strong federal actions to deal with 
national problems agreed with the direction that the Adams administration was taking. 
Jackson and another emerging faction would strongly oppose this sort of activist 
federal government, advocating instead for states’ rights. 
Improvement, both personal and political, was a popular ambition in the 1820s. 
Adams worried about becoming a better person, and he swam naked in the Potomac 
every day to improve his body. But he also wanted to improve the country, and he 
saw the money freed from paying off the Revolutionary War debt and the income 
from sales of federal lands as the perfect opportunity for investing in the country. Th e 
General Survey, conducted by army engineers when John C. Calhoun was secretary 
of war, was the blueprint. Adams, with an eye to southern voters, proposed a second 
National Road to link Washington, D.C., to New Orleans. He proposed, and Congress 
approved, building the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal that would connect with the 
original National Road and link the Potomac with the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. 
Postmaster General John McLean built post offi ces in rural areas and subsidized the 
stagecoach industry to carry the mail and connect the nation’s far-fl ung people to one 
another. Adams also proposed a new national university to be based in Washington 
and a national observatory—a “lighthouse of the skies.” All of these activities were 
designed to knit the nation together, advancing knowledge and making it easier to 
transport goods. In addition, the intent was to unite the nation in a single political 
entity and a market economy, especially aft er the divisions sparked by the debates 
around the Missouri Compromise (see Map 9-4 on page 275). 
Secretary of State Clay was involved in all these efforts and, in fact, during the 
presidential campaign, had described a program of internal improvements and protective 
tariff s that came to be known as the “ American System .” In Clay’s mind, the 
American System would reduce poverty by linking all Americans (all white Americans; 
Clay considered neither his own 50 slaves nor others’ slaves to be Americans) in a 
prosperous commercial community. Th e system was American because it made the 
federal government an agent of economic development. Clay believed that the roads 
and canals, as well as the support of interstate commerce that he and Adams wanted 
to foster on a federal level, would make a stronger and more united America, commercially, 
geographically, and socially. Ultimately, Clay wanted transportation and 
commerce to bridge traditional sectional divides and create a thriving commercial 
nation that was united by common national investments. Moreover, the system 
was potentially a way to protect the country by building an infrastructure that could 
serve military needs, allowing troops to move quickly from one part of the country to 
another when necessary. Finally, the American System would protect infant American 
industries through a strong tariff that would allow them to develop and thus reduce 
American dependence on cheaper foreign imports. 
In one of his last acts as speaker in 1824, Clay led an eff ort to increase the average 
tariff from 20 percent to 35 percent. Th e new higher tariff made him a hero to 
New England mill owners and their workers whose jobs it protected. It was also popular 
in commercial centers like Cincinnati, Ohio, and Clay’s hometown of Lexington, 
Kentucky, where new industries needed protection. But the improvements and tariff s

of the American System were not popular in other parts of the country. A high tariff 
raised the cost of everything southern cotton planters had to buy but did nothing to 
raise the price of their cotton in the market. Th ey saw the tariff and the president’s 
antislavery opinions as a sign of a federal government that was working against their 
economic interests, and many in the South hardened their opposition to Adams, Clay, 
and the American System. 
As the 1828 presidential campaign built steam, Adams and Clay continued their 
pitch for the costs and benefits of the American System. Jackson, however, had a 
more focused agenda: to replace Adams, the minority president, with the man who 
had rightfully won in 1824. Ironically, although Adams ardently wanted to avoid the 
“baneful weed of party strife,” it was during his term that new American political parties 
were born. 
The Jackson Victory of 1828 and the Rebirth of Political Parties 
From the day he left Washington, D.C., in 1825, Jackson was running to become 
president in 1828. He believed that he and his supporters had been cheated, and he 
meant to be vindicated. Nevertheless, it took time for the campaign to take shape. It is 
easier to understand the birth of political parties in retrospect than it was at the time. 
Many Americans were glad to see the old Federalist Party gone; at the same time, they 
hated to see the Democratic-Republicans splinter. At fi rst, the two factions in Congress 
were described simply as “Adams men” and “Jackson men.” After the midterm 
Congressional elections of 1826, the “Jackson men” controlled Congress. Th e “Adams 
men” then started to call themselves National Republicans, that is, Democratic- 
Republicans who supported the national administration led by President Adams. Th is 
group, led primarily by Henry Clay, would become the core of the new Whig Party , 
the party that advocated for a strong national government role in the economy, internal 
improvements such as roads and canals, and social reform movements in general. 
Th e “Jackson men” continued to call themselves Democratic-Republicans, emphasizing 
that they were the rightful winners of the last election and represented the democratic 
will of the people, which had been thwarted by Adams and Clay in the 1824 
Whig Party

This stylized picture of Andrew Jackson speaking to a crowd begins to suggest the enormous popularity that 
the former war hero had as he connected with diverse audiences of voters in a way no leader since George 
Washington had done.

election. Soon, the Jacksonians dropped the “Republicans” in their name and were 
simply known as Democrats, forerunners of the Democratic Party that throughout 
the 1800s argued for the rights of the “common man” to be left alone by centralized 
government and economic interests. 
Neither party was fully organized in the 1828 election and though each had 
newspapers that were strongly on their side, other hallmarks of national political 
parties like national nominating conventions came later. Nevertheless, from 1828 
on, most Americans expected presidential elections to be hotly contested by two 
or more candidates representing their respective political parties and running on 
specifi c promises. Th e era of electing a few wise men to select the best president was 
over forever. 
The prime architect of Jackson’s campaign and his political agenda, besides 
Jackson himself who delegated little, was Senator Martin Van Buren of New York. 
Van Buren was a strict constructionist of the Constitution who believed that the 
American System advocated by Adams and Clay violated the Constitution because 
it involved the federal government in many matters not specifi cally assigned to it by 
the Constitution. Although a New Yorker, Van Buren was closely allied with many 
in the South who liked Van Buren’s commitment to a small federal government 
because they feared that if the federal government could involve itself in shaping 
the nation’s economy, it could also interfere with slavery, a threat that terrifi ed the 
slaveholding class. 
Th e campaign of 1828 was as nasty as any in American history. Newspapers took 
on a larger role than ever before endorsing candidates and spreading slander about 
the opposition. Th e National Republicans reminded voters of Jackson’s temper and 
his many brawls and duels, which they said were unpresidential, as well as the times he 
may have exceeded his authority in attacking Indians or executing British subjects. In 
addition, they attacked his marriage to Rachel Jackson. More than 30 years earlier, the 
Jacksons had been married before Rachel’s divorce from her fi rst husband was fi nal, 
so she was thus guilty of bigamy. Th e attack on their marriage infuriated Jackson and 
deeply hurt Rachel. When she died shortly aft er the election, Jackson never forgave 
his adversaries. 
The campaign organized by Jackson and Van Buren was equally nasty. They 
reminded voters of the supposed “corrupt bargain” that had put Adams in the White 
House and claimed—with no proof—that Adams, as ambassador to Russia, had 
procured young American women for the Czar’s pleasure. They portrayed Adams 
as cold and elitist and attacked his Unitarian beliefs as un-Christian compared with 
Jackson’s devout Presbyterian faith. For the Democrats, the campaign was not about 
the American System but a choice “Between J.Q. Adams, who can write, and Andy 
Jackson who can fi ght.” Th e fi ghter won easily. 
Th e popular vote nearly tripled between 1824 and 1828, and 57.5 percent of all 
eligible voters actually voted. All but two states, Delaware and South Carolina, chose 
presidential electors by popular vote for slates pledged to one candidate or another in 
1828. Campaigning had risen to new heights, and more voters believed that their votes 
counted. Political parties organized a new get-out-the-vote eff ort, which for the fi rst 
time, included election materials such as buttons, mugs, posters, and slogans. In the 
end, Jackson won 647,286 votes—56 percent of the popular vote—and 178 electoral 
votes, and Adams won 508,064 popular votes and 83 electoral votes. (Four years earlier 
the popular vote had been 153,554 votes for Jackson to 108,740 votes for Adams.) 
Th ere was no need for the House of Representatives to be involved. A new style of 
electioneering had emerged.

CONCLUSION 
Washington Irving’s story, Rip Van Winkle , published in 1819, tells the story of a man 
who aft er a 20-year nap awakens to fi nd that everything in his village has completely 
changed. The story captures the transformation of the physical, commercial, and 
political landscapes of the United States and the corresponding changes in the lives of 
Americans during the fi rst decades of independence—largely caused by the rapid growth 
of cotton production and technological innovation. Although it would have seemed 
unimaginable even a few years earlier, aft er 1815, distances seemed shorter, money and 
material goods more important, and politics omnipresent to many Americans, not just 
national leaders. Production of cotton and all the accompanying commerce it generated 
changed the lives of nearly all of the country’s residents and focused the attention 
of many Americans on productivity and hoped-for prosperity. Slavery expanded from 
the Atlantic coast as thousands of enslaved people were forced to move into the interior 
of the country where the black belt, stretching from Georgia through Alabama, 
Mississippi, and Louisiana, became the center of cotton production based on the backbreaking 
labor of slaves. At the same time, many white Americans, especially young 
women, who had been used to the rhythms of farm life, went to work in highly regimented 
mills, spinning cotton into cloth. Other Americans transported cotton between 
states and across the Atlantic Ocean at speeds their forbearers could not have imagined. 
Th e new prominence of public clocks with a hand that noted minutes in addition to 
the passage of hours refl ected this shift . Th e demand for cotton and the labor-intensive 
process of its cultivation led to the explosion of slavery in the South, the growth of the 
textile industry in the North, and a revolution in industry and transportation. 
New York City emerged as a transportation hub connecting the United States to 
the international cotton trade. Th e Erie Canal also secured New York’s place as a commercial 
center as it made transport between interior locations and coastal ports more 
effi cient. Steamboats, canal boats, transatlantic packet ships, and stagecoaches traveled 
the routes in ever-faster circuits. Banks, some of the fi rst and most important 
corporations in the young nation, played an essential role in the market economy. 
Corporate shareholders, a dramatically new development, deepened the stability of 
businesses and extended their ability to operate. However, the cotton market slumped 
in 1819, which caused an economic downturn and fi nancial panic among Americans. 
Although the economy would eventually recover and thrive, the experience refl ected a 
new and not fully understood national economy. 
During Monroe’s administration, the Supreme Court, led by Chief Justice John 
Marshall, decided a series of cases that expanded the power of the federal government 
and limited that of the states, claiming a role for the Supreme Court in reviewing 
the constitutionality of acts of state legislatures, which would become important in 
the years to come. Despite general calm during the Era of Good Feelings of Monroe’s 
two-term administration, political tensions over the cotton economy, territorial 
expansion, and slavery exploded with surprising force in the 1820s. When Missouri 
applied to become a state in 1819, the divisions over slavery intensifi ed, and although 
the Missouri Compromise was meant to resolve the diff erences, many agreed with 
the aging Th omas Jeff erson that it was “a reprieve only.” Th e Era of Good Feelings 
gave way to divisive contests for the presidency in 1824—a victory for John Quincy 
Adams—and in 1828—a victory for Andrew Jackson—and the rebirth of political parties. 
Jackson’s political agenda refl ected his concerns for the economic and political 
interests of a broad spectrum of white America that was growing in infl uence in the 
government, and he represented the symbolic voice of a new generation.

Chapter 9 Summary and Review 
CREATING THE COTTON ECONOMY 
9.1 
Explain the role of cotton in transforming the land and the lives 
of many diverse people of the United States. 
Summary 
Two developments in the late 1790s set the stage for the rapid 
expansion of cotton production in the United States. First, in the 
late 1700s many Europeans came to prefer clothing made of cotton 
rather than of other fi bers. Second, a series of technological 
innovations revolutionized the production of cotton cloth. Th e 
invention of the cotton gin greatly increased the economic viability 
of processing cotton in the United States. Increased cotton 
cultivation had a transformative eff ect on the American economy, 
both in the North and the South, and fueled the expansion 
of slavery. Th e acquisition of new lands for cotton cultivation 
was made possible by the Louisiana Purchase, Andrew Jackson’s 
military victories, and John Quincy Adams’s negotiations. While 
slavery slowly disappeared in the North aft er 1800, and the slave 
population of Maryland, Virginia, and the Carolinas stabilized or 
declined, slavery exploded in the interior cotton growing lands. 
Th e production of cotton textiles in the North was at the core 
of the Industrial Revolution in the United States, and New York 
City played a key role in linking the United States to the international 
cotton trade. However, slumping demand for American 
cotton in Europe led to the panic of 1819. Banks’ reactionary 
responses worsened the problem; the interconnected nature of 
the country’s national economy was not yet well understood. 
Fortunately, the economy eventually recovered and thrived. 
Review Questions 
1. Chronological Reasoning 
How did events and developments in the 1790s set the stage 
for the rapid expansion of cotton production in the United 
States in the early 1800s? What role did events taking place 
outside of the United States play in this process? 
2. Historical Interpretation 
How did the expansion of cotton production shape the 
development of slavery in the United States? In what ways 
did it make life harder for enslaved African-Americans? 
3. Historical Interpretation 
How did the expansion of cotton production shape the 
development of the commercial economy in the United 
States? What new opportunities and challenges did it create 
for northern workers? 
Preparing to Write: Using Evidence 
Choosing just the right piece of evidence is critical to creating 
a strong argument. With this point in mind, reread the 
excerpt from the writings of Harriet H. Robinson included in 
this section (see “An American Voice” above). Make a list of 
short quotations from this passage that you think would be 
particularly useful in an essay on early strikes in the American 
textile industry. 
COMMERCE, TECHNOLOGY, AND TRANSPORTATION 
9.2 
Analyze the technological and fi nancial changes that led to the 
emergence of a new market economy in the United States. 
Summary 
As more white and black Americans moved further into the 
interior of the country, the need for improvements in internal 
transportation became essential to the country’s commercial 
development. Th e Erie Canal linked the growing regions 
of upstate New York, western Pennsylvania, and Ohio to the 
eastern seaboard, particularly New York City. Steamboats revolutionized 
water transportation, producing particularly dramatic 
changes in the role of the Mississippi River in commerce. 
Federal and state eff orts to improve roads also contributed to 
better internal transportation. With increased speed in travel, 
news also moved much more quickly. As a result of a series of 
legislative actions and court decisions in the early 1800s, corporations 
became a permanent and important feature of American 
economic life aft er 1815. Some of the fi rst and most important 
corporations were banks. Banks played an essential role in the 
market economy by printing paper currency and making loans. 
Th e changes brought about by the growth of the market economy 
touched almost every aspect of American life. 
Review Questions 
4. Historical Interpretation 
How did the transportation revolution create new connections 
between Americans and alter old ones? How did it 
facilitate the movement and exchange of people, products, 
and ideas?

promotion of economic growth and improvement. Jackson 
spent the years between his defeat in 1824 and the election 
of 1828 building a political organization capable of defeating 
Adams. The election of 1828 was a nasty affair, pitting 
Adams and the National Republicans against Jackson and the 
Democrats. Jackson’s eventual victory was also a victory for a 
new kind of party politics.

FROM THE ERA OF GOOD FEELINGS TO THE POLITICS OF 
DIVISION 
9.3 
Explain the political developments in the United States during 
the 1820s, including the shift of power toward the South and 
West that resulted from the changing economic situation. 
Summary 
James Monroe’s presidential administration that began in 1817 
was known as the Era of Good Feelings because of the lack of 
rancor in his election and subsequent reelection. However, the 
same years saw growing political tensions that would explode 
in the 1820s. Confl ict over an amendment to the 1819 Missouri 
statehood bill prohibiting the introduction of new slaves into 
the state and gradually freeing those who were already there 
led to the Missouri Compromise of 1820. The election of 
1824 marked the end of the Era of Good Feelings. The election 
revealed deepening sectional divisions within the country. 
When no candidate received a majority of the electoral vote, the 
election was decided in the House of Representatives, where 
John Quincy Adams was declared the winner. Supporters of 
Andrew Jackson, who had won the popular vote, saw this decision 
as a “corrupt bargain” between Adams and Henry Clay, 
then speaker of the House of Representatives. President Adams 
and his newly appointed secretary of state, Henry Clay, argued

Politics dominated the thinking of many Americans in the Age of Jackson. This painting titled 
Stump Speaking captures the scene as a large group of white men gathered to hear a political 
speaker. 
Andrew Jackson’s inauguration as president in March 1829 was a 
somber aff air for Jackson himself, who was still mourning his wife 
Rachel’s death the previous December. He did not make the traditional 
call on the outgoing president, blaming John Quincy Adams for 
attacks that he believed hastened Rachel’s death, and he did not attend 
his own inaugural ball. For his supporters, however, Jackson’s inauguration 
was a raucous celebration of democracy. When Jackson arrived at 
the White House, a festive crowd overran the place, stood on the furniture, 
broke china, and had to be lured outside with bowls of spiked punch. 
A Washington observer, Margaret Bayard Smith complained about what 
she saw as the rabble that inundated the White House, describing their 
behavior as “scrambling, fi ghting, romping.” Supreme Court Justice Joseph 
Story called it “the reign of King Mob.” But order was restored, and Jackson’s 
agenda began to emerge. 
Jackson cared about a few big issues, and these shaped his agenda as 
president. He did not worry much about how the issues were connected. 
During both of his campaigns for the presidency in 1824 and 1828, he had 
promised to acquire land for white settlement by forcing Indian tribes to 
move west of the Mississippi River. He also promised to undermine the 
Bank of the United States and the power of northern economic elites. 1828–1844

He was opposed to Henry Clay’s American System and wanted to keep taxes low and 
the role of the federal government modest. Th at said, Jackson understood power and 
was committed to expanding the power of the presidency itself. As he proceeded with 
his agenda, he was oft en challenged, and his response was to fi ght back with all the 
resources he could fi nd. 
Th e era during which Jackson led the country was known as the Age of Jackson. 
Jackson was the symbolic voice of a new generation and a specifi c class of American 
people. Th e fi rst president born west of the Alleghenies, he was not connected to the 
Founding Fathers as all of his predecessors had been. He spoke for the economic and 
political interests of a broad spectrum of white America that was growing in infl uence 
in the government. Although it was not his doing, Jackson also presided over a nation 
in which the churches and the schools expanded and changed signifi cantly. 
JACKSONIAN DEMOCRACY, JACKSONIAN GOVERNMENT 
Analyze Jackson’s advocacy for Indian Removal, his opposition to the Bank of the United 
States, his support for a tariff, and the impact of these policies on other Americans. 
Jackson knew what he wanted to accomplish as president. Before implementing any 
other policies, he planned a clean sweep of senior federal offi ce holders, some of whom 
had served under several presidents. Jeff erson’s successors—Madison, Monroe, and 
John Quincy Adams—had made few changes below the level of the Cabinet itself, 
partly because they were all from the same political party and partly because they did 
not see it as the president’s role to make wholesale personnel changes. In a signifi cant 
change of practice, Jackson replaced many offi cials, and in the process, created the suspicion 
that there had been corruption without evidence for it. Jackson believed in what 
came to be called the “ spoils system ,” which was a patronage system in which a victorious 
political party rewards a candidate’s supporters with government jobs. Jackson 
used the term “rotation in offi ce,” but his supporters believed “to the victor belongs the 
spoils.” Suddenly with Jackson in offi ce, experienced offi cials, including 25 customs 
collectors and 423 postmasters, were fi red from what had been a small, stable federal 
bureaucracy. Services deteriorated, and the quality of some federal services like the 
postal service did not recover until civil service reform took hold in the 1880s.

10.1 
Martin Van Buren, architect of Jackson’s 1828 campaign for president, became 
secretary of state. But other of Jackson’s cabinet offi cers were less talented, and Jackson 
oft en ignored them. Instead, he surrounded himself with informal advisors who came 
to be known as his “Kitchen Cabinet,” longtime friends and advisors who worked 
closely with the president, particularly to accomplish removing Indians from wanted 
lands, revoking the charter for the Second Bank of the United States, and preserving 
the authority of the federal union against radical supporters of states’ rights. 
Jackson’s Presidential Agenda 
Jackson had several interlocking, but not entirely consistent, priorities. He distrusted 
government at all levels but had unbounded trust in his own ability to govern. He 
meant not only to be an activist president—John Quincy Adams and other presidents 
had also followed strong agendas—but also to make the presidency the center of the 
American government. He would not defer to Congress in ways that all of his predecessors 
had done. He vetoed more congressional bills than all of his predecessors 
combined and made it clear that Congress would have to reckon with him. As he had 
announced before the election, he was determined to force the Indians who lived in 
northern Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi to move west to clear the land for white 
settlement. Although he supported a modifi ed tariff , he meant to scale back the size of 
the federal government. He hated the Bank of the United States and was determined 
to destroy it. He saw its charter as an inappropriate use of federal authority and was 
convinced, probably rightly, that the bank had contributed to Adams’s campaign. And 
perhaps most of all, Jackson was determined to preserve the Union at a time when 
southern leaders were insisting that each state had the right of nullifi cation , the right 
to declare that specifi c federal legislation was null and void within its borders. Jackson 
was a slaveholder and a defender of slavery, but if slaveholders threatened national 
unity, they would have to deal with him. 
In his two terms as president, Jackson realized most of his goals, despite fi erce 
opposition. He established permanent precedents for presidential authority. He was 
a hero to some and an evil genius to others. For most historians, he remains one of 
the most complex American leaders, expanding the roles of poor and working-class 
whites in the political process and of the presidency in American life, while reducing 
the rights of Indians, slaves, federal employees, bankers, and indeed anyone who disagreed 
with him. 
The Indian Removal Act, the Trail of Tears, and the Settlement of 
Oklahoma 
For some white Americans, “Indian Removal”—Jackson’s policy of forcing the Cherokee 
Nation and other tribes to move to reservations in distant Oklahoma, or Indian Territory 
as it was called, was a great achievement. For the tribes caught in Jackson’s web, the policy 
led to war within the tribes, terrible losses, resistance, resignation, and reinvention. 
Th eir white supporters, though passionate, were ineff ective against Jackson. 
Known as the Five Civilized Tribes , the Cherokees, Chickasaws, Choctaws, 
Creeks, and Seminoles had for generations lived in the region known as the Old 
Southwest—Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi—as well as in Arkansas, and Florida. 
Th ese tribes had traded and fought with Spanish, French, and English settlers and had 
sold or ceded much of their land, but based on treaties with the U.S. government, they 
still owned huge tracts of land in the heart of the cotton-growing South. 
Far more than the Indians of the Northwest or the West, the Five Civilized Tribes 
had adopted many white ways and customs, intermarried with whites, and created 
a unique culture based on farming and trade. Of the fi ve tribes, the Cherokee 
Nation had the most sophisticated political, economic, and cultural institutions.

Five Civilized Tribes 
The Cherokees, Chickasaws, Choctaws, 
Creeks, and Seminoles, who had established 
treaty agreements with the United States in 
the late 1700s or early 1800s, lived in peace 
with their neighbors and adopted more of 
the ways of the whites than most Native 
Americans.

the Cherokees expected to be treated as a sovereign country. Th e Cherokees, who had 
supported the British during the Revolution, had signed a treaty with the new United 
States government in 1785 and never again waged war against the United States. Th ey 
supported Jackson in his battle with the Creeks and lived at peace with their neighbors, 
but that did them little good once Jackson determined his course of action. 
Aft er making peace with the United States in the 1780s, the Cherokees took well 
to the European-style of communication and farming. In 1821, a Cherokee warrior, 
Sequoyah, intrigued by what he called the “markings” of written English, invented 
an 86-character alphabet that represented the syllables of spoken Cherokee. Th e new 
alphabet caught on quickly, not only in handwritten form but also in typeface for 
printing. Th e Cherokee Phoenix , published in both English and Cherokee, became an 
important means of communication. Sequoyah, who never learned English, created a 
similar alphabet for the Choctaw language. His achievement to invent a written language 
while being illiterate in all languages had never before been done. In addition, the 
Cherokees set up a large and eff ective trading network with other tribes and the white 
community. In 1827, they adopted a written constitution for the Cherokee Republic. 
Beginning in the 1790s, Christian missionaries came to live among the Cherokees. 
The Cherokees welcomed them, though most never became Christians. Using 
Sequoyah’s alphabet, the missionaries translated the Bible into Cherokee and later 
became some of the most heroic defenders of Cherokee rights. 
Cherokees also cultivated cotton as their white neighbors did, and some owned 
African slaves. An 1825 census counted 13,563 Cherokees, 220 whites (some of whom 
were married to Cherokees), and 1,277 African slaves in the Cherokee Republic. Of all 
the American Indian tribes, the Cherokees were the model of assimilation that presidents 
from Washington to Jeff erson claimed to want. But white settlers and President 
Jackson decided to ignore the assimilation. Th ey wanted the land. 
Georgia took the lead in seizing Indian land. In 1824, Governor George Troup 
announced that he was ending treaty rights for the Cherokee and Creek tribes. 
When President John Quincy Adams opposed him, citing the tribes’ treaties with the 
U.S. government, Troup and his successor, John Forsyth, campaigned for Jackson in 
1828. In December 1828, the Georgia legislature declared that, starting in June 1830, 
Georgia state laws would extend to all parts of the Cherokee Republic despite federal 
treaty agreements to the contrary. White Georgians then began moving onto Cherokee 
lands, and Jackson withdrew U.S. troops that had been protecting the Cherokees. 
It was in this context that Jackson addressed Congress, advocating an Indian 
Removal Act to “protect” the Cherokees from Georgia laws. Th e president gave the 
tribes what seemed like a choice: “voluntarily” move west to new lands where their 
independence would be honored or choose to stay where they were. But if they chose 
to stay, they would be subject to the laws of Georgia, laws that said Indians could not 
vote, own property, testify against a white person in court, or obtain credit. It was not 
much of a choice, as Jackson himself said in private. 
Th e land that the government off ered the tribes was completely unfamiliar to the tribes 
of the Old Southwest. Most people thought of it as simply a desert where farming would 
be impossible. Indian Territory, which eventually became the state of Oklahoma, was a 
portion of the Louisiana Purchase just north of Texas. Th e land was not empty, though 
the government tended to treat it that way. Some of the plains tribes—the Wichitas, 
Kiowas, Kiowa Apaches, and especially Osages—had lived there for generations. Some 
tribes from the Ohio-Illinois area—Shawnees, Delawares (Lenapes), Miamis, Kickapoos, 
Sacs, and Fox—had been relocated to that territory aft er defeats by the U.S. Army. In 
addition, there were a few white settlers and some slaves and former slaves seeking refuge 
in the region. Nevertheless, under Jackson’s plan, the government was now off ering the 
territory to the Cherokees and others of the Five Civilized Tribes (see Map 10-1 ). 
While Cherokee, Creek, Chickasaw, Choctaw, and Seminole leaders had long 
feared just such a move and had been protesting against it, many whites now rallied to 
their side. In Congress and the national press, Indian Removal became a major fi ght. 
Indian Removal Act 
Legislation passed by Congress in 1830 
which provided funds for removing and 
resettling eastern Indians in the West. It 
granted the president the authority to 
use force if necessary and resulted in the 
involuntary transfer of thousands of Native 
Americans to new homes in Oklahoma. 
Sequoyah was intrigued with the way reading 
seemed to give whites power. He created an 
alphabet for the Cherokee language and, later, a 
similar one for the Choctaw language.

Catharine Beecher, a reformer associated with many causes, organized women across 
the Northwest to defend Indian rights and fl ooded Congress with petitions. Missionaries 
campaigned against the bill so vigorously that Georgia sentenced two of them to prison 
at hard labor for refusing to abandon the Indians. 
In the Senate, Theodore Frelinghuysen of New Jersey, long a supporter of 
Protestant missionaries and reform eff orts, led the opposition to the Indian Removal 
Bill. Frelinghuysen insisted that the government was bound by its treaties and that, if 
need be, should use the U.S. Army to force Georgia to retract its claims to the Indian 
lands. Henry Clay, who had not previously spoken in favor of Indian rights, joined the 
antiremoval forces. In the end, the removal bill passed the Senate 28 to 19, but passed 
the House by only a 102–98 vote. Among those voting no was Congressman Davy 
Crockett of Tennessee, who called the bill “oppression with a vengeance.” But Jackson 
signed the law May 28, 1830, making half a century of treaties void. Th e tribes would 
have to move. While all of the tribes resisted, negotiated, and ultimately had to surrender, 
the Cherokees went to U.S. courts to assert their claims to their lands. Initially,

Americans responded differently to President Andrew 
Jackson’s plan to remove American Indians from the Old 
Southwest to reservations west of the Mississippi. Most whites 
in Georgia and many elsewhere applauded. In the north, many 
opposed Indian Removal, and Catharine Beecher organized a petition 
campaign in which women petitioned Congress to stop what 
they saw as an immoral process. Not surprisingly, most Cherokees, 
like the other tribes involved, also opposed removal. Writing a 
decade before Jackson’s speech, Cherokee women demanded that 
the tribal elders not cede land to the United States. The following 
three documents represent three different American voices.

June 30, 1818 
The condition and ulterior destiny of the 
Indian tribes within the limits of some of 
our States have become objects of much 
interest and importance. It has long been 
the policy of Government to introduce 
among them the arts of civilization, in the 
hope of gradually reclaiming them from 
a wandering life. This policy has, however, 
been coupled with another wholly incompatible 
with its success. Professing a desire 
to civilize and settle them, we have at the 
same time lost no opportunity to purchase 
their lands and thrust them farther into 
the wilderness. By this means they have 
not only been kept in a wandering state, 
but been led to look upon us as unjust and 
indifferent to their fate. . . 
Our ancestors found them the uncontrolled 
possessors of these vast regions. By 
persuasion and force they have been made 
to retire from river to river and from mountain 
to mountain, until some of the tribes 
have become extinct and others have left 
but remnants to preserve for awhile their 
once terrible names.… 
Humanity and national honor demand 
that every effort should be made to avert 
so great a calamity.… 
As a means of effecting this end I suggest 
for your consideration the propriety of 
setting apart an ample district west of the 
Mississippi, and without the limits of any 
State or Territory now formed, to be guaranteed 
to the Indian tribes as long as they 
shall occupy it, each tribe having a distinct 
control over the portion designated for its 
use. There they may be secured in the enjoyment 
of governments of their own choice, 
subject to no other control from the United 
States than such as may be necessary to 
preserve peace on the frontier and between 
the several tribes.… 
THAT your memorialists are deeply 
impressed with the belief that the present 
crisis in the affairs of the Indian nations, 
calls loudly on all who can feel for the woes 
of humanity….It is readily acknowledged, 
that the wise and venerated founders 
of our country’s free institutions, have 
committed the powers of government to 
those whom nature and reason declare 
the best fitted to exercise them; and your 
memorialists would sincerely deprecate 
any presumptuous interference on the part 
of their own sex, with the ordinary political 
affairs of the country, as wholly unbecoming 
the character of American Females.… 
yet all admit that there are times when 
duty and affection call on us to advise and 
persuade , as well as to cheer or to console. 
And if we approach the public representatives 
of our husbands and brothers, only in 
the humble character of suppliants in the 
cause of mercy and humanity, may we not 
hope that even the small voice of female 
sympathy will be heard?… 
In despite of the undoubted natural 
right, which the Indians have, to the land of 
their forefathers, and in the face of solemn 
treaties, pledging the faith of the nation 
for their secure possession of those lands, 
it is intended, we are told, to force them 
from their native soil, and to compel them 
to seek new homes in a distant and dreary 
wilderness. 
To you then, as the constitutional 
protectors of the Indians within our territory 
and as the peculiar guardians of 
our national character, and our country’s 
welfare, we solemnly and earnestly appeal 
to save this remnant of a much injured 
people from annihilation, to shield our 
country from the curses denounced on the 
cruel and ungrateful, and to shelter the 
American character from lasting dishonor. 
We have called a meeting among ourselves 
to consult on the different points now 
before the council, relating to our national 
affairs. We have heard with painful feelings 
that the bounds of the land we now 
possess are to be drawn into very narrow 
limits. The land was given to us by the 
Great Spirit above as our common right, to 
raise our children upon, & to make support 
for our rising generations. We therefore 
humbly petition our beloved children, the 
head men & warriors, to hold out to the 
last in support of our common right, as 
the Cherokee nation have been the first 
settlers of this land; we therefore claim the 
right to the soil. 
We well remember that our country 
was formerly very extensive, but by 
repeated sales it has become circumscribed 
to the very narrow limits we have at 
present. Our Father the President advised 
us to become farmers, to manufacture 
our own clothes, & to have our children 
instructed. To this advice we have attended 
in everything as far as we were able. Now 
the thought of being compelled to remove 
[to] the other side of the Mississippi is 
dreadful to us, because it appears to us 
that we, by this removal, shall be brought 
to a savage state again, for we have, by 
the endeavor of our Father the President, 
become too much enlightened to throw 
aside the privileges of a civilized life. 
We therefore unanimously join in our 
meeting to hold our country in common as 
hitherto. 
Some of our children have become 
Christians. We have missionary schools 
among us. We have h[e]ard the gospel 
in our nation. We have become civilized 
& enlightened, & are in hopes that in a 
few years our nation will be prepared for 
instruction in other branches of sciences & 
arts, which are both useful & necessary in 
civilized society.…

10.1 Thinking Critically 
1. Documentary Analysis 
How did Jackson attempt to argue that Indian Removal was 
in the Indians’ best interest? How might opponents of Indian 
Removal have responded to his position? 
2. Contextualization 
How might the fact that two petitions in opposition to 
Indian Removal were written by women have affected their 
reception? How might it have helped the authors’ cause? 
How might it have hurt? 
3. Contextualization 
The Cherokee women say that they hope that, soon, their 
people “will be prepared for instruction in other branches of 
sciences & arts, which are both useful & necessary in civilized 
society.” What does this statement mean? What do you think is 
the strongest reason they give for asking not to be moved west? 
they won. In Cherokee Nation v. Georgia (1831) and Worcester v. Georgia (1832), the 
U.S. Supreme Court, under Chief Justice John Marshall, ruled that the Cherokees were 
a “domestic dependent nation” and could not be forced by the state of Georgia to give 
up land that treaty rights agreed to by the United States government had given them. 
Jackson simply ignored the court. Jackson is supposed to have said, “John Marshall 
has made his decision, now let him enforce it.” No one actually heard Jackson say that, 
but Jackson controlled the army and he was not about to enforce the court’s decision. 
No other president before or aft er ignored the Supreme Court in that way. 
Th e Indian Removal Act and the implementation that followed was a disaster for 
the Five Civilized Tribes. Th e government had seized their homes and off ered in return 
land that was thousands of miles away and completely foreign to them. Moreover the 
tribes were divided about how to respond. While most of the country was focused on the 
Cherokees, Jackson sent Secretary of War John Eaton to negotiate with the Choctaws. 
By excluding those he considered troublemakers and bribing others, Eaton got a small 
group of Choctaw leaders to agree for the tribe to leave its homes in Mississippi, but 
most in the tribe considered those who negotiated the removal treaty to be nonrepresentative 
and refused to abide by it. Th e federal troops enforced it anyway. 
Th e French observer Alexis de Tocqueville, who became famous for his analysis 
of American life in the Jacksonian era, described the day the Choctaws crossed the 
Mississippi River on their way west: 
At the end of 1831, I stood on the left bank of the Mississippi.…It was then the 
depths of winter and the cold was exceptionally severe…the snow had frozen 
hard on the ground; the river was drift ing with huge ice-fl oes. Th e Indians 
had brought their families with them and hauled along the wounded, the 
sick, newborn babies, and old men on the verge of death. Th ey had neither 
tents nor wagons….I saw them embark to cross the wide river and that solemn 
spectacle will never be erased from my memory. Not a sob or complaint 
could be heard…they stood silent. Th eir affl ictions were of long standing and 
they considered them beyond remedy. Already the Indians had all embarked 
upon the boat which was to carry them; their dogs still remained upon the 
bank. When these animals fi nally saw they were being left behind forever, they 
raised all together a terrible howl and plunged into the icy Mississippi to swim 
aft er their masters. 
Within the decade most members of the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Creek tribes had made 
the same crossing. Only the Seminoles avoided their fate. 
Alabama and Mississippi followed Georgia’s lead and voted to end tribal rights for 
the Creeks. In March 1832, the Creeks surrendered all land east of the Mississippi, and 
most of them moved to Oklahoma. Th ose that took advantage of a promise that they 
could stay in the East as private citizens soon lost their lands. Some of the remaining 
Creeks began violent resistance to state and federal authorities, but the so-called 
Second Creek War of 1836–37 ended quickly when Jackson’s secretary of war ordered 
federal troops to expel all Creeks from lands east of the Mississippi. Th e Creeks who

were deported aft er the Second Creek War suff ered higher mortality rates than the 
Cherokees; perhaps half lived to see Oklahoma. 
Among the Cherokees, a civil conflict broke out about how to respond to the 
demand that they move to Oklahoma. Principal Chief John Ross and most of the 
Cherokees were determined to fi ght for their lands. A minority, some of whom were 
among the rising middle class and slave holders within the tribe, decided that a compromise 
was better than forced expulsion. John Ridge and Elias Boudinot, publisher 
of the Cherokee Phoenix , signed the Treaty of New Echota in December 1835, trading 
land in Georgia for new land in Oklahoma and $5 million. Th e U.S. Senate barely ratifi 
ed the treaty aft er Daniel Webster and Henry Clay pointed out how fraudulent it was 
since the majority of the Cherokees opposed it. 
Aft er Ridge and Boudinot and their followers departed for Oklahoma, or Indian 
Territory as it was called, the U.S. Army put most of the remaining members of the 
tribe in detention camps. A few were able to fl ee into the wilderness and remained 
in their homelands but without their land. Others fought, but in the end, Chief Ross 
and General Winfi eld Scott negotiated a settlement to avoid further bloodshed. Even 
though Jackson had left offi ce by then, his successor, Martin Van Buren was determined 
to enforce his predecessor’s policy. From the detention camps, soldiers forced 
12,000 Cherokee men, women, and children to march west in the fall and winter of 
1838–39. It was an especially cold winter and a terrible time to make a march of over 
a thousand miles into the unknown. Th e Cherokees never had enough food, blankets, 
or warm clothing, and as they moved in large groups, disease and exposure took a terrible 
toll. On what became known as the Trail of Tears , perhaps a quarter to a third of 
the marchers, including Ross’s wife, died before they reached Oklahoma. 
Seeing what was happening to other tribes, the Chickasaws moved west quickly on 
their own. Th e Seminoles of Florida Territory had no intention of moving, however. 
Although a minority of Seminoles agreed to move, most stayed in Florida, disappearing 
into the swamps and hiding places they knew well. When soldiers tried to force them 
to move, the Seminoles annihilated them. Th e Second Seminole War was not resolved 
until 1842. Fewer Seminoles than members of any other tribe ever moved to Oklahoma.

In the meantime, the Sac and Fox tribes, which had already been exiled to the 
Indian Territory as a result of earlier removals from the Old Northwest, were not too 
happy about life there. In April 1832, a chief named Black Hawk led 1,000–2,000 Sac 
and Fox people back east across the Mississippi, closer to their old homelands. Th e Sac 
and Fox Indians were moving mostly to escape from hostile Sioux groups on the Great 
Plains and Iowa Territory. Th e Illinois governor took the tribes’ move into Illinois as 
an attack, called out the militia, and asked for federal troops. In Black Hawk’s War, 
federal and state troops on the east side of the Mississippi and Sioux warriors on the 
west virtually annihilated the Fox and Sac tribes, to the delight of whites who were 
happy to see these tribes completely out of their way. 
In fact, Jackson had meant to use the removal law for Georgia to force all Indians 
east of the Mississippi out of their lands. When the forced exile fi nally reached its goal 
by the end of the 1830s, only the Iroquois in New York, a few Cherokees in North 
Carolina, and scattered small communities remained legally east of the Mississippi, 
although others like the Seminoles simply melted into the woods and could not be 
found by the government. All in all, 46,000 Indians were forcibly removed during the 
Jackson administration, and subsequent administrations removed as many more. 
The Cherokees and other tribes tend to disappear from the history books after 
the Trail of Tears. But the Cherokees, Choctaws, and Creeks were resilient people. 
Forced onto an inhospitable and alien land, they sought to reestablish their communities 
and culture. To a surprising degree, they succeeded. As the last Cherokees arrived 
in Indian Territory in 1839, the tribe adopted a new Constitution and established 
Tahlequah as their capital. In 1844, they began publishing the Cherokee Advocate in 
both English and Cherokee. Th ey also set up a school system with elementary schools 
as well as higher education institutes and seminaries to prepare teachers—European 
and Cherokee—for their schools. In the U.S. Civil War, parts of the tribe favored 
each side, and the divided tribe fought internally. But again they rebuilt aft er the war. 
Today, there are some 200,000 to 300,000 Cherokees, of whom 70,000 live within the 
Cherokee Nation in northeast Oklahoma and the rest are scattered around the country, 
making them the largest federally recognized tribe today. 
Jacksonian Economics—The War on the Bank of the United States 
In his campaign for president, Jackson pledged to do something about the Bank of the 
United States, which he and many others blamed for the Panic of 1819 and saw as an 
elitist threat to a democracy. Th e Second Bank of the United States was patterned on 
the fi rst Bank of the United States that had been a cornerstone of Alexander Hamilton’s 
economic plans for the new nation (see Chapter 7 ) . Th e fi rst bank had been chartered 
in 1791 for a period of 20 years. In 1811, the Jeff ersonian Republicans refused to extend 
its charter and it closed. Henceforth, it seemed, state banks would issue currency in the 
form of banknotes backed by gold or silver, federal funds would be deposited in state 
banks, and the federal government, like everyone else, would borrow money from 
these banks when needed. Th en came the War of 1812. 
As the War of 1812 threatened to bankrupt the country, some of the nation’s richest 
men, led by John Jacob Astor, met with Treasury Secretary Albert Gallatin and off ered 
to loan the nation the funds it needed if the Bank of the United States were rechartered. 
Th ey believed that only a national bank could build long-term prosperity and 
ensure that their loan would be repaid. As a result, a charter for a Second Bank of 
the United States passed Congress in 1816. Th e Madison, Monroe, and John Quincy 
Adams administrations were strong advocates for a unifi ed national market economy 
that could foster prosperity and stability, and they had used the bank to support that 
economy. Jackson wanted prosperity, but he disagreed about the government’s role in 
the nation’s economy. 
Th e Second Bank of the United States was never without enemies. Th e Constitution 
never mentioned a bank, and strict constructionists—who thought the government

should limit its role to things specifically included in the Constitution—always 
opposed it. The bank was also seen by many as a way to expand the power of the 
commercial elite based in New York and Philadelphia and, thus, was seen as an 
enemy by farmers whether they lived on small out-of-the-way farms in the still very 
rural country or on the bourgeoning plantations of the cotton-growing South. In the 
opinion of many farmers, whether small or large scale, Jackson was the defender of 
their interests against threatening commercial elites. Particularly since the Supreme 
Court’s ruling on McCulloch v. Maryland that Congress had the right to charter a 
bank if it thought it was in the national interest, popular support for the Bank had 
weakened (see Chapter 9 ) . Many farmers did not believe “the national interest” that 
Congress saw was in their interests. 
During his fi rst months in offi ce, Jackson did not say a lot about the bank, but 
in December 1829, he told Congress: “Both the constitutionality and the expediency 
of the law creating this bank are well questioned.…[I]t has failed in the great end of 
establishing a uniform and sound currency.” In spite of Jackson’s challenge, the bank’s 
charter ensured that it could continue for 7 more years, but Jackson had fi red a warning 
shot. Before long, he would do much more. 
Many of Jackson’s strongest supporters disagreed with him about the bank. Th e 
country was prospering, credit was solid, and the soundness of the currency, despite 
Jackson’s words, seemed secure. Th e federal bank’s policies of calling in loans may 
have helped start the Panic of 1819, but Nicholas Biddle, the bank’s president, had 
done as much as anyone in the country to end the hard times after the Panic of 
1819. Nevertheless Jackson was a populist, intending to represent the common people 
politically. And although the nation’s elite supported the bank, many citizens 
did not like any banks. In a meeting at the White House he told Biddle, “I do not 
dislike your bank any more than all banks,” but the federal bank was the only one 
Jackson could do something about. His attack on the bank was as emotional as it 
was calculated. 
For the next few years, Biddle led the bank in continued eff orts to stabilize the 
currency, help state banks through difficult times, and expand the nation’s credit, 
something that both northern mill owners and western land promoters liked. Th e 
bank also concentrated wealth and power within the economy in the hands of a 
commercial elite and strengthened the nation’s unifi ed market economy based on 
currency and trade. Th at uneven concentration of wealth and power was something 
Jackson would not forgive. 
In 1832, Jackson launched his campaign for reelection. For the fi rst time, something 
resembling modern political parties played a role. Under Jackson’s leadership, the 
Democratic-Republicans had become simply the Democrats. Th ey easily nominated 
Jackson for a second term and his handpicked running mate, Secretary of State Martin 
Van Buren, for vice president. Th e opposition to Jackson, sometimes known as the 
National Republicans because they had supported a strong national government, now 
became known simply as the Whig Party. Th ey nominated Henry Clay for president 
and John Sergeant of Pennsylvania as vice president. Unlike the Jacksonian Democrats, 
the Whig Party was committed to Alexander Hamilton’s vision of a federal government 
that took an active role in shaping the economy, so they strongly supported the Second 
Bank of the United States. Th e Whig nominee, Henry Clay, urged Biddle to secure 
the bank’s future as well as that of the pro-bank Whig Party. If Biddle were to request 
an extension of the bank’s charter, even though the original charter would not expire 
for 4 years, Clay would promise to make the bank an issue in the campaign. Either 
Biddle would win the recharter fi ght immediately, or he would provide Clay a weapon 
with which to attack Jackson. Biddle, who was astute at counting votes in Congress, 
took Clay’s advice and applied for a new charter. Th e charter bill passed both houses 
of Congress easily. But Jackson vetoed it. He told Martin Van Buren, who was now 
his running mate, “Th e bank, Mr. Van Buren, is trying to kill me, but I will kill it.”

10.1 
In November 1832, Jackson defeated Clay 219 electoral votes 
to 49. Congress refused to override the president’s veto. 
Biddle still tried to rally support in Congress. He made 
arguments, offered congressmen loans, and ensured that 
the bank’s lead attorney was elected to Congress from 
Philadelphia. When Massachusetts Senator Daniel Webster 
complained that his annual retainer from the bank had not 
been “refreshed as usual,” Biddle promised quick action. 
Biddle also loosened credit across the country, ensuring 
short-term prosperity but provoking an eventual reckoning. 
He was desperate to save his bank. 
Jackson then made his move. He ordered his treasury secretary 
to remove federal deposits from the bank and place them in 
23 state banks that he selected—banks that were quickly called 
Jackson’s “pet” banks by his opponents. Th e move was meant to 
destroy the Second Bank of the United States. But the law said 
that federal funds could be withdrawn only if there was clear 
evidence that the deposits were not secure. Even Jackson’s handpicked 
auditors could fi nd no such evidence. When Treasury 
Secretary McLane refused the president’s order to move the 
funds, Jackson promoted him to secretary of state. When 
another treasury secretary also refused, Jackson fi red him. 
Finally, Jackson’s third treasury secretary, Roger B. Taney, who also had doubts 
about the legality of removing federal funds, hit on a compromise. He would 
not actually remove federal deposits from the bank, but he would do something 
just as effective to undermine the bank. Going forward, Taney regularly paid the 
government’s bills with funds from the accounts that the government had in the 
Bank of the United States, but he stopped depositing new federal revenue in the bank. 
Instead, the government’s income went to the state banks. It was a mortal blow. Th e 
federal government’s accounts slowly shrunk to zero and the Second Bank of the 
United States was dead, though it took a few years to die. 
Led by Clay, the Senate censured the president, saying he had “assumed upon 
himself authority and power not conferred by the Constitution and laws.” But the 
censure did not hurt Jackson or save the bank. Biddle’s politically motivated loans 
and payments sapped support for the bank. Th e Second Bank of the United States 
became a wholly private bank and soon went bankrupt. Th e combination of infl ation 
caused by Biddle’s too-easy credit and the loss of a national bank that could stabilize 
the currency caused fi nancial distress. By 1837—just aft er Jackson left offi ce—the 
nation experienced another fi nancial panic, and there was no national entity to help 
stabilize the economy. Nevertheless, eff orts to revive the bank failed. For decades, all 
of the paper currency in circulation would be issued by state banks, some of less than 
solid credit. Only in 1863, during the Civil War, did the U.S. government again issue 
paper money, and not until the creation of the Federal Reserve Bank in 1913 did the 
nation again have a central bank to regulate the economy. 
The Tariff , the Union, and the Nullifi cation Crisis 
Th e battle over the tariff began as a modest disagreement over federal tax policy. Before 
it ended, that battle was the greatest constitutional crisis the nation faced between the 
adoption of the Constitution in 1789 and the Civil War in 1861. To a degree, it was a personal 
battle between two proud and stubborn men, Andrew Jackson and John C. Calhoun. 
In another sense it was a battle about the fundamental nature of the U.S. government.

By the time Jackson became president, political cartoons were becoming popular, 
including this one that shows Jackson using his order to withdraw government 
funds to topple the pillars of the bank as Nicholas Biddle, the bank’s “devil president,” 
and investors run.

and he was reelected to that offi ce in 1828 to serve with Jackson. Because separate ballots 
were cast for presidential and vice presidential candidates aft er the passage of the 
Twelft h Amendment in 1804 and before the rise of party nominating conventions in 
1832, no one thought it strange that two leaders as hostile to each other as Adams and 
Jackson would have the same vice president. As a congressman and as secretary of war 
under President James Monroe, Calhoun had been a nationalist who favored internal 
improvements as much as Henry Clay or John Quincy Adams. He sought a strong 
national government and had supported the Bank of the United States. Although his 
views diff ered from Jackson’s on some issues, everyone expected Calhoun and Jackson, 
as proslavery southerners, to have a close partnership. It was not to be. 
One of the first wedges between them was purely social. Jackson’s Secretary of 
War John Eaton had married the recently widowed Margaret O’Neale Timberlake, but 
rumors swirled that she was a widow only because her fi rst husband, a naval offi cer, 
had committed suicide when he learned of her long adulterous relationship with Eaton. 
Jackson, who had been deeply hurt by attacks on his own marriage, defended the 
Eatons. Others in Washington, led by Mrs. Calhoun, snubbed Peggy Eaton. When Emily 
Donelson, Jackson’s offi cial White House hostess, joined with Mrs. Calhoun, Jackson 
temporarily banished her from the White House. He never forgave the Calhouns. 
Another reason for the growing split between Jackson and Calhoun centered on 
the fact that Calhoun’s political beliefs were changing. By 1828, Calhoun, who had 
previously advocated for a strong federal role in the life of the nation—far stronger 
than anything Jackson ever advocated—was becoming the nation’s strongest defender 
of states’ rights against federal authority. Th is new stance may have refl ected an honest 
change of heart, but it also served a political purpose. Regardless, it guaranteed a clash 
with Jackson since no matter how much Jackson might have favored states’ rights in 
the past, he would not tolerate any challenge to his authority as president. 
Many of the leaders in South Carolina, Calhoun’s home state, were becoming very 
fearful of the federal government, and South Carolina was developing the strongest antifederal 
stance in the Union. Th e South Carolina Radicals, as they were called, dominated 
state government. Th ey advocated the right of states to declare any federal law null and 
void or even to secede from the Union. Th e reason was clear: South Carolinians feared 
for the future of slavery more than people in any other state. Most residents of South 
Carolina—54 percent—were enslaved people of African descent. In some rice-growing 
regions of the state, that fi gure was closer to 90 percent. A wealthy but deeply fearful 
white elite governed these slaves and depended on their labor to generate continuing 
wealth. In 1827, a pamphlet called Th e Crisis; or, Essays on the Usurpations of the Federal 
Government argued that federal tariff s, internal improvements, and other federal activities 
were all means to enable the national government, if it chose, to abolish slavery. 
As word spread that Parliament was about to abolish slavery throughout the British 
Empire in the 1830s, the fear grew that Congress might try to do the same. Calhoun had 
to decide whether he was with his state’s planter elite or against them. He might have 
dreamed about becoming president someday, but in the meantime, he would have to win 
elections in South Carolina. He made his choice. 
NULLIFICATION AND THE FUTURE OF THE REPUBLIC In 1828, Calhoun wrote 
a pamphlet arguing that a state could declare a tariff or any other federal law null 
and void. Calhoun claimed that since state-by-state conventions had ratified the 
Constitution, state conventions, not the Supreme Court, had the authority to decide 
what was constitutional. In his view, once a state convention declared a federal 
law void, other states would have to weigh in, and only a new amendment to the 
Constitution could force the law on the dissenting state. Calhoun did not advocate 
secession as many of the South Carolina Radicals did. Instead, he hoped nullifi cation 
in response to a tariff or to restrictions on slavery would make secession unnecessary. 
He was thus more moderate than many South Carolinians, but that moderation would 
not continue to be the case.

Th e tariff , not the issue of slavery, brought the issue of nullifi cation to the fore. 
Th e tariff , or tax on imported goods, had been the major source of fi nancial support 
since the Washington administration, and it had been an issue in the 1828 election 
in which Jackson defeated Adams. As Jackson’s supporters prepared for that election, 
Jackson’s chief advisor Martin Van Buren realized that, even though he and Jackson 
opposed a high tariff —in part, because they thought the federal government needed 
less money and, in part, because the tax raised the cost of foreign-made consumer 
products in the United States—the Adams-Clay tariff was popular in many parts 
of the country because it protected local industries from foreign competition and 
because many people liked the internal improvements like roads and canals that the 
tariff helped fi nance. Adams and Clay might want to fi ght the 1828 election on the 
issue of tariff s, but Van Buren did not. When the Adams administration suggested a 
new tariff , Van Buren and his congressional allies decided to reshape it rather than 
oppose it. Th ey knew they could not win New England in the next election, so they 
did not hesitate to modify the proposed tariff by reducing the protection for the cotton 
produced by New England mill owners, thus allowing foreign-made cotton to be 
sold more cheaply than might otherwise have been the case. Th ey also raised tariff s 
to protect export of products like molasses, hemp, iron, and wool, which were produced 
in the mid-Atlantic states, especially in Pennsylvania, to woo voters there by 
protecting their industries and jobs from foreign competition. Th e result was a tariff 
that raised the price of products that many Americans bought from foreign sources 
and that angered the cotton mill owners who originally wanted the tariff but now 
saw the protection of their industry disappear. Th e new tariff also infuriated rural 
interests, especially southern plantation owners, who saw the cost of everything they 
needed go up while no protection was provided to the price of the goods they produced 
and sold on the international market. Th e 1828 tariff came to be known as the 
Tariff of Abominations because it was so uneven and obviously unfair in the industries 
and regions it protected, but it passed Congress and set the stage for a confusing 
presidential campaign and the crisis that followed. 
Planters in South Carolina saw the tariff as a terrible hardship and an unfair use of 
federal power. To a degree, they were right. A tax on imports raised the cost of virtually 
everything the planters needed. Planters claimed that 40 out of every 100 bales 
of cotton they produced went to pay the tariff . Th is claim was an exaggeration, but 
the tariff may have raised the cost of living in South Carolina by 20 percent. In addition, 
planters worried that a tariff on imported goods might cause other nations to 
purchase less cotton either in retaliation or because, with Americans buying less from 
abroad, other nations might not have had the funds to purchase American grown cotton. 
With their state’s economy hurting, public opinion in South Carolina supported 
nullifi cation of the tariff . 
The issue of states’ rights versus the rights of the federal government was 
argued on the floor of the U.S. Senate in January 1830. It was a debate that 
would be remembered for generations. South Carolina Senator Robert Y. 
Hayne, a protégé of Calhoun’s, claimed that the federal government was making 
the North the winner and the South the loser and that the pro-Northern policy 
“has invaded the State of South Carolina, is making war upon her citizens, 
and endeavoring to overthrow her principles and institutions.” Everyone understood 
that Hayne was talking about the tariff but also the issue of slavery. He 
was determined to defend the right of South Carolina to nullify federal law and, 
if still dissatisfi ed, to secede from the Union if Congress ever made a move against 
slavery. Massachusetts Senator Daniel Webster’s “ Second Reply to Hayne ” staked out 
a diff erent position. Webster pleaded for a strong federal union that no state should 
be allowed to undermine. His closing line, “Liberty and Union, now and forever, one 
and inseparable” became part of American lore. Hayne congratulated Webster on 
winning the war of words, though Hayne never changed his mind.

10.3 
At fi rst, people wondered how the president would respond to 
the debate. Jackson had campaigned for reducing the federal role in 
people’s lives, but he did not like to be crossed. He was not elected 
to see the government over which he presided pushed aside. As a 
military man, he would not countenance mutiny. As a politician, 
he despised Calhoun’s self-serving strategic maneuvering. To the 
surprise of some, Jackson, the president elected with virtually no 
support from New England, embraced Webster’s speech in spite 
of the fact that it was given by the senator from Massachusetts. 
Four months after the Hayne-Webster debate, political leaders 
were asked to make toasts at a banquet. Looking directly at his vice 
president, Jackson, off ered a simple toast, “Our Union: It must be 
preserved .” Calhoun responded, “Th e Union. Next to our liberty, the 
most dear. May we always remember that it can only be preserved 
by respecting the rights of the states.…” It marked the fi nal break 
between the two men. 
Nevertheless, as strongly as Jackson believed in asserting federal 
authority, he was still prepared to compromise about the tariff itself. 
Th e actual rate charged in the tariff mattered far less to Jackson than 
the principle that no state had a right to nullify federal law. A compromise 
seemed possible when Congress convened in 1831. Former 
President John Quincy Adams had been elected to the House of 
Representatives from Massachusetts (the only former president in 
history to return to Congress), and the congressional leaders asked 
him to write a new tariff to replace the Tariff of Abominations. 
Adams took the job seriously. He reduced the duty on goods not 
produced in the United States and therefore not in need of protection, but retained 
tariff s to protect growing U.S. industries, especially iron and cotton textiles. He also 
reduced the tariff on cheap woolens—which slaves wore—from 45 percent to 5 percent, 
a signifi cant concession to the slave states. 
Most of the South found Adams’s tariff reasonable. Besides, much of the cottongrowing 
South was prospering, despite the tariff , because of other Jacksonian policies, 
especially from the new land that Indian Removal had made available for growing cotton. 
Other states were in no mood to press the nullifi cation issue. 
But South Carolina was diff erent. Much of the state’s farmland had been exhausted 
by decades of overuse, and its dependency on slave labor made its leaders more fearful 
of federal intervention in the institution of slavery than those of any other state. 
Led by Calhoun, the state’s leaders believed that they had to win the right to nullify 
the tariff to establish the larger principal that states could nullify any law. For them, 
the Adams tariff was not enough. In November 1832, a South Carolina state convention 
declared that both the tariff s of 1828 and 1832 were unconstitutional and that “it 
shall not be lawful…to enforce payment of duties imposed by the said acts within the 
limits of this state” aft er February 1833. Th ey also said that the state would secede if 
the federal government tried to force it to back down. Th e South Carolina legislature 
elected Robert Hayne, who had debated with Webster, as the governor to lead the 
state through these diffi cult times and elected Calhoun to replace Hayne in the Senate. 
Calhoun would essentially be South Carolina’s ambassador to the federal government 
for the next 2 decades. Calhoun resigned as vice president in December 1832, a little 
more than 2 months before his term ended, and returned to the Senate as a member, a 
very belligerent member. Th e stage was set for a major confrontation. 
In November 1832, the South Carolina legislature also raised a state militia of 25,000 
volunteers. Jackson responded with a proclamation, stating that the state’s vote was “in 
direct violation of their duty as citizens of the United States.” According to Jackson, 
they had no right to nullify federal law and certainly not to raise their own army and, 
In January 1830 as tensions were building over the 
right claimed by South Carolina to nullify federal 
law, Massachusetts Senator Daniel Webster— 
shown here—defended the priority of the federal 
government and the cause of the national union.

he said, “Disunion by armed force is treason.” He told a South Carolina congressman, 
“I will hang the fi rst man of them I can get my hands on to the fi rst tree I can fi nd.” He 
backed his words with action, reinforcing federal garrisons and sending armed revenue 
ships to Charleston Harbor. He also shift ed the collection of customs duties in 
Charleston to warships off shore. When Governor Hayne told Senator Th omas Hart 
Benton of Missouri that he did not think Jackson would really hang anyone, Benton, 
who knew Jackson better, replied, “I tell you, Hayne, when Jackson begins to talk about 
hanging, they can begin to look out for ropes!” Jackson also lobbied to ensure no other 
southern state supported South Carolina and pushed Congress to keep the tariff s low. 
In the end, no shots were fi red. On March 1, 1833, Congress passed a compromise 
tariff that Henry Clay had craft ed based on Adams’s proposals and gave the president 
the authority to put down the rebellion. Wiser heads in South Carolina decided 
to compromise. Th e state convention reconvened and declared victory based on the 
new Clay tariff . For spite they also nullifi ed the congressional vote of new military 
authority, which they called the “Force Bill,” but that action was now meaningless 
since South Carolina was no longer resisting federal authority. 
Jackson won the nullifi cation battle, but it was an incomplete victory. He made 
it clear, in words and actions, which Abraham Lincoln would use as precedent, that 
no state could nullify federal law and that the U.S. government would use force to 
assert its authority. He was treated as a hero in many parts of the country and even

Document When Historians 
Disagree: Debating Andrew Jackson 
The 1832 South Carolina convention that passed the 
Ordinance of Nullification said: 
Whereas the Congress of the United States, by 
various acts, purporting to be acts laying duties 
and imposts [taxes] on foreign imports, but in 
reality intended for the protection of domestic 
manufacturers, and giving the bounties to classes 
and individuals engaged in particular employments, 
at the expense and to the injury and oppression of 
other classes and individuals…hath exceeded it just 
powers under the Constitution… 
We, therefore, the people of the State of South 
Carolina in Convention assembled, do declare and 
ordain…That the several acts and parts of acts of 
the Congress of the United States, purporting to be 
laws for the imposing of duties and imposts on the 
importation of foreign commodities…are unauthorized 
by the Constitution of the United States, and 
violate the true meaning and intent thereof, and are 
null, void, and no law, nor binding upon this state, 
its officers or citizens. 
This declaration was not the first time in U.S. history that a state 
had taken such a stand. The Kentucky and Virginia resolves 
of 1798 and 1799, written by Thomas Jefferson and James 
Madison, had said the same thing about the Alien and Sedition 
Acts. The Hartford Convention that met in 1814 said the much 
the same thing about Congress having declared war on Great 
Britain in 1812. Yet unlike the response to earlier challenges, 
President Jackson declared the South Carolina ordinance 
“incompatible with the existence of the Union” and prepared for 
a military response.

given an honorary degree by Harvard University. Even so, neither Calhoun nor the 
South Carolina legislature admitted defeat. In fact, that legislature passed a new law in 
1834 requiring anyone holding state offi ce to swear primary loyalty to South Carolina 
and only conditional loyalty to the federal government. Th is law eff ectively barred 
Unionists, those moderates who disagreed with nullifi cation, perhaps a third of the 
state’s voters, from state offi ce for the next 30 years. 
Alexis de Tocqueville was in the United States during the Nullifi cation Crisis. He 
took a dim view of the compromise on the tariff and the decision of South Carolina to 
nullify the “Force Bill”: 
Either I am mistaken or the federal government of the Unites States is daily 
losing its power; it is gradually withdrawing from public aff airs and is increasingly 
narrowing its sphere of action.…I think I have seen a more lively feeling 
of independence and a more evident aff ection for regional government developing 
in the individual states of the Union. 
The outcome of this movement, Tocqueville said, was “hidden in the future and 
I do not claim the ability to lift the veil.” But he remained worried for the future of 
the country. 
10.1 
Quick Review Was Andrew Jackson’s presidency democratic? Which of his actions and 
policies support your argument? 
DEMOCRATIZED RELIGION: THE SECOND GREAT AWAKENING 
Analyze the diversity of American religious experience and how the freedom of the era gave 
rise to diverse religious expressions. 
Most Americans had strong opinions about Andrew Jackson. Th ey might love or hate 
him, but they followed his career. However, politics was far from the only interest of 
most people. Many things closer to home, and sometimes closer to their own souls, 
mattered more. For many Americans in the 1820s and 1830s, the growth of a more 
popular democracy and popular social movements led by ordinary citizens was far 
more important than President’s Jackson’s policies or opinions. 
No popular movement was more powerful than the upsurge in religious activity 
that took place in Jacksonian America. Once again de Tocqueville understood the 
country well: “Th ere is no country in the whole world in which the Christian religion 
retains a greater infl uence over the souls of men than in America.” He described the 
Christianity he saw as “a democratic and republican religion.” When de Tocqueville 
wrote these words in the early 1830s, the Second Great Awakening was in full swing. 
It had begun around 1800 (see Chapter 8 ) , but gathered new strength in Jacksonian 
America. Contrary to what Tocqueville implied, not all Americans were Protestant 
Christians, and many of those who were Christians did not fit into traditional 
Protestantism. But for a large number of those who lived from the 1820s to the 1840s, 
religion was important, even if formal membership in a specifi c religious congregation 
was not. 
Charles G. Finney and New York’s “Burned-Over District” 
In 1821, Charles Grandison Finney, a 29-year-old lawyer in Adams, New York, not far 
from the Erie Canal, was struggling with the question of whether true religious belief 
was consistent with his legal career. He decided to leave his law practice, and began to 
preach in churches in upstate New York, eventually becoming one of the most infl uential 
preachers in the United States.

10.2 
In July 1824, Finney was ordained a Presbyterian minister in spite of his lack of 
formal training. In 1826, the spirit of revivalism hit upstate New York, and in 1830, 
Finney led the largest religious revival ever seen in Rochester, New York. Six hundred 
people joined one of the town’s three Presbyterian Churches, and the other denominations 
were also strengthened. 
Finney did not seek an emotional catharsis from his congregants but, like an 
attorney, argued his case logically using wit and wisdom. Nevertheless, in his preaching, 
the rigid religious orthodoxy that dominated Congregational and Presbyterian 
churches gave way to a more egalitarian spirit. Finney called people to change their 
lives, not necessarily to agreement with specifi c creeds. Because of his preaching, hundreds, 
then thousands took religion more seriously, joined churches, participated in 
reform movements, and changed New York and American society. 
By the late 1830s, the area along the Erie Canal where Finney preached had become 
known as “the burned-over district” because of the fi res of religious enthusiasm that 
rolled over the region. Finney was far from the only revivalist in New York. However, 
he gave the New York revivals a distinct tone—diff erent not only from the emotionalism 
of frontier revivals but also from the staid life of many established churches. Th e 
Erie Canal also made communications easier and faster than before, so word of the 
revivals traveled fast. 
Lyman Beecher and the Growth of Voluntary Societies 
As a young minister, Lyman Beecher had been one of the staunchest defenders of 
state support for the Congregational churches in Connecticut (see Chapter 8 ) . Once 
the Connecticut churches lost their government support, Beecher embraced the new 
situation and supported revivals and voluntary associations for moral reform in New 
England and the nation. Beecher described his goal: 
A Bible for every family, a school for every district, and a pastor for every 1000 
souls, must be the motto upon the standard, round which the millions who 
enjoy these blessings must rally for the purpose of extending them to those 
who do not. 
As the Second Great Awakening grew in force in the 1820s and 1830s, a series of voluntary 
societies or interdenominational organizations that Beecher helped launch grew 
in their infl uence. Th ese societies were not owned by any one 
religious body but, rather, depended on the voluntary contributions 
of members of several diff erent religious bodies. Th ey represented 
a new form of cooperation across traditional religious 
lines in the service of a larger goal to change the culture of the 
United States. Th e American Bible Society distributed Bibles, the 
American Sunday School Union provided curriculum materials 
for church-based Sunday schools, and the American Education 
Society supported the education of ministers. In addition, the 
American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions sent 
missionaries around the world, including Adoniram Judson and 
his wife Ann Hasseltine Judson, whose eff orts in Burma became 
role models for generations of foreign missionaries to convert 
the world to Christianity. Beecher included prominent members 
of the Congregational, Presbyterian, and Episcopal churches in 
the leadership of these societies. Th e underlying mission of all 
of these societies was moral reform—the creation of a sober, 
God-fearing, American public. 
By the early 1830s, Beecher had become convinced that the 
key to transforming the nation lay in the Mississippi Valley. He 
became president of Lane Th eological Seminary in Cincinnati to 
Lyman Beecher, one of the leaders of the Second Great Awakening, is shown here 
with his numerous children including petitioner and educator Catharine (to the 
left of her father), Harriet Beecher Stowe (far right), and one of the most famous 
ministers of the next generation, Henry Ward Beecher (standing on the right).

fulfi ll this goal. Beecher helped prepare future ministers, strengthened religious colleges, 
and placed Protestant pastors in hundreds of Midwestern churches. He also helped create 
the public school system of Ohio and supported schools and teachers across the Midwest. 
Th e goal of all of this activity was to strengthen the moral sway of Congregational- 
Presbyterian Protestantism against the individualism of Jacksonian Democrats, 
Catholics, and other Protestants who disagreed with them. In the world that Beecher 
and his fellow Protestant evangelists were creating, the separating of church and state 
meant that specific denominations would not wield political power, but together, 
these Protestants would help build a culture in which the churches, voluntary societies, 
and public schools would reinforce common beliefs and practices. 
Revivalism and Moral Reform Movements 
Most converts in the revivals that preachers like Finney and Beecher led, perhaps 
three-fourths of them, were women who then prayed and lobbied for their husbands 
and families to convert. Finney and his closest lieutenant, Th eodore Dwight Weld, 
encouraged women to be active in their religious communities. Where New England 
churches had urged women to keep silent except at home, the new generation of revivalists 
welcomed them as prayer leaders and preachers. Such speaking in “promiscuous 
assemblies,” may have been familiar in Baptist and even Methodist churches, but it 
was new in the more middle-class Presbyterian and Congregational churches. Women 
who became religious leaders in the revivals oft en also became leaders in their communities. 
Th e movement demanding women’s rights that swept the United States in 
the 1840s sprang from the same areas of upstate New York that revivalists called the 
burned-over district (see Chapter 12 ) . Th e link was not surprising. 
For Finney, conversion meant that one needed to show one’s new faith in ethical 
behavior, and no ethical behavior was more important to him than opposing slavery. 
Upstate New York’s churches sent revivalist preachers into the rest of the country to 
preach for the abolition of slavery. For the next 30 years, the Finney-Weld brand of 
revivalism spread across the country and was one of the streams of abolitionism that 
inspired Northerners to fi ght a war to end slavery. 
Th e rights of women and opposition to slavery were not the only reform causes to 
spring from the revivalism of the Second Great Awakening. Other reformers, inspired 
by the same forces, began to advocate for important changes in the way prisoners were 
treated. Too oft en, they said, overcrowded prisons were simply schools for crime, and 
the focus on punishment, whatever the original crime, did little to redeem or reclaim 
prisoners to reenter society. At fi rst, reformers advocated the building of prisons in 
which each prisoner would be confi ned to a solitary cell where they would have time 
to refl ect on their past, be taught new habits, and prepare to reenter society. But too 
oft en, the solitary confi nement led to insanity rather than reform. In response, prison 
reformers built a new kind of prison in which each prisoner had a separate cell, but 
also had access to common dining quarters, workshops, and a chapel. In all of these 
spaces, the authorities sought to teach prisoners a new way of behaving as preparation 
for reclaiming them. In the 1830s, the New York state penitentiary at Auburn was 
redesigned to foster the new approach, and soon thereaft er, a large new penitentiary 
at Sing Sing on the Hudson River was built with 1,000 cells plus the common areas. 
Reformers hoped that the new, more humane approach would change lives and ultimately 
society. Other states quickly followed in adopting the new models. 
Many mentally ill people were treated very much like prisoners before the reforms, 
and they oft en found themselves in similar circumstances. Reformers quickly took up 
the cause of those they said were insane. Perhaps no one equaled Dorothea Dix as 
a reformer in the treatment of the mentally ill. In 1843, Dix told the Massachusetts 
legislature that she was calling their attention “to the present state of Insane Persons 
confi ned within this Commonwealth, in cages, closets, cellars, stalls, pens! Chained, 
naked, beaten with rods, and lashed into obedience!” Moreover, she had the facts to

prove her point. Th e result, beginning in Massachusetts, was that a system of state 
hospitals for the insane replaced the earlier prisons. 
Many other reforms also blossomed. Although the campaign against alcohol would 
reach its peek many decades later, it began during the Second Great Awakening. Lyman 
Beecher preached temperance sermons that were widely reprinted, including one in 
which he said, “What then is this universal, natural, and national remedy for intemperance? 
It is the banishment of ardent spirits from the list of lawful objects of commerce…” 
Many, including members of Congress took the pledge to stop drinking, the U.S. Army 
stopped the old tradition of a ration of alcohol, and refusing to drink became a mark 
of religious observance in many circles. At the same time, the American Peace Society 
advocated an end to all wars. Th e American Sunday School Union distributed not only 
Bible stories, but also basic reading books in places where there were no schools. Schools 
were opened for those who were deaf and blind. Eff orts were made to rescue prostitutes. 
Countless reforms designed to create a better, more humane, and sometimes more 
tightly controlled society emerged from the enthusiasm of the awakening. 
Utopian Religious Communities 
Th e religious enthusiasm of the early 1800s also inspired untraditional ways of thinking 
about religious matters. Large American spaces that allowed people to develop their own 
communities relatively undisturbed and the American emphasis on liberty, even the liberty 
to be eccentric, made the United States fertile ground for radical experiments and utopian 
religious communities. Some of these religious experiments were short lived. Others 
lasted for generations. A few, most of all the Mormons, have continued to the present. 
MOTHER ANN LEE AND THE SHAKERS The founder of the United Society of 
Believers in Christ’s Second Appearing, or the Shakers, was Ann Lee—known as 
Mother Ann Lee—who before the American Revolution gathered a few supporters in 
England and came to America in 1774. Lee was convinced that she was receiving a 
special revelation from God that human sexuality was the basis of all sin and celibacy 
was the only way to live a godly life. 
Lee inspired Shaker communities in New York and New England. Shaker 
worship refl ected Lee’s spirituality and, according to observers, included, “shaking 
and singing, hopping and turning, smoking and running, groaning and laughing.” 
Shaker communities at New Lebanon, New Hampshire; Sabbath Day Lake, Maine; 
and elsewhere thrived, and the Shakers became one of the largest and most successful 
of the pre-Civil communitarian movements. 
This illustration from an anti-alcohol publication makes the claim that drunkenness was the cause of many 
problems in society, especially the abuse of women.

Shaker theology placed Ann Lee on a par with Jesus and committed the society to 
the equal leadership of women with men. But Shakers were united by their community 
life more than by theology. Th ey demanded celibacy, a requirement that limited 
the community’s appeal and prevented increasing membership by means of childbirth. 
Instead, all new members had to be converts who were attracted to Shaker life. 
Th e revivals produced many such converts who sought a deeper spiritual life than they 
found in traditional churches. Shaker beliefs were refl ected in their commitment to 
making things of beauty, and Shaker furniture remains a reminder of their beliefs. 
In Shaker worship and community life, women and men were kept separate, but all participated in lively 
music and dance designed to shake sin out of their bodies. 
The simplicity and joyfulness of the Shakers have infiltrated 
American culture in many ways. Shaker furniture, now 
so popular, was not just a product for them. Mildred Barker, 
leader of a Shaker Community in Maine, who died in 1990, once 
reflected, “I almost expect to be remembered as a chair or a table.” 
But Barker reminded those who came to interview her that behind 
all of the Shakers’ physical artifacts, “There’s the religion.” And 
while many of their complex theological ideas have largely been 
forgotten, the basic joy, humility, and playfulness of the Shakers 
continue to be remembered in this familiar hymn that dates to 
the 1830s: 
‘Tis the gift to be simple, ‘tis the gift to be free; 
‘Tis the gift to come down where we ought to be; 
And when we find ourselves in the place just right, 
‘Twill be in the valley of love and delight. 
When true simplicity is gaind, 
To bow and to bend we shan’t be asham’d 
To turn, turn will be our delight, 
‘Till by turning, turning we come round right.

Th e things they created, whether furniture, houses, or art, were owned in common,

JOHN HUMPHREY NOYES AND THE ONEIDA COMMUNITY The Oneida 
Community also had its roots in the Second Great Awakening and flourished in 
Oneida, New York, between 1848 and 1879. Its founder and spiritual guide was John 
Humphrey Noyes, who was born in Vermont in 1811. As a student for the ministry, 
he became convinced that repentance from sin was not enough and that people 
should simply stop sinning. Noyes became convinced that all Christians could 
achieve a state “in which all the aff ections of the heart are given to God, and in which 
there is no sin.” 
Gathering a small community in Putney, Vermont, he expanded his defi nition of 
Christian perfectionism to include what he called “complex marriage,” an arrangement 
in which monogamy was replaced with many sexual companions. Noyes argued 
that sexual pleasure was a gift from God and that Christianity demanded the sharing 
of that gift without any exclusive or jealous reservations. 
Vermont authorities, however, took a dim view of these sexual practices and 
beliefs, and Noyes and his followers moved to Oneida, New York, where the community 
thrived for decades, supported ultimately by producing and selling silverware. 
Oneida eventually fell victim to Victorian morality and to its dependence on Noyes as 
its single charismatic leader. Between 1875 and 1879, Oneida was torn by debates as 
New York authorities began threatening arrests for Oneida’s fl outing of the marriage 
laws. Noyes fl ed to Canada and the community dissolved although the silver business 
supported former members for generations. 
R OBERT OWEN AND THE NEW HARMONY COMMUNITY Aft er making a fortune 
in London, Robert Owen founded a model factory town at New Lanark, Scotland, in 
which he sought to put the spirit of universal welfare into practice. In the early 1820s, 
Owen decided to relocate his utopian vision of a community designed to benefi t all of 
it members and establish it in the United States. 
In early 1825, 900 people arrived at New Harmony, Indiana, where Owen had purchased 
land. But New Harmony failed within a year. Th e community could not attract 
enough skilled workers to make it economically successful. Th ere was tension between 
those who ran New Harmony and the rest of the community. As one disaff ected resident 
recalled, the “aristocrats” quarreled, and the fi elds went to ruin. Owen lost most 
of his fortune, which he had invested in New Harmony, but returned to England to 
continue to advocate his version of social reform. 
J OSEPH SMITH AND THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF THE LATTER-DAY 
SAINTS Joseph Smith (1805–1844) was as much a product of New York’s burnedover 
district as Charles G. Finney. Smith was born in 1805 and moved with his family 
to a farm in Palmyra, New York, when he was age 11. In 1827, word spread along 
the Erie Canal that Smith had found a treasure that would unlock the Indian history 
of the area. He had, he said, found golden plates and magical stones known as Urim 
and Th ummim with which to read and translate what was written on the plates by 
an ancient prophet-historian named Mormon. He published the result, the Book of 
Mormon , in 1830. With that book, a uniquely American religious tradition was born, 
one that its followers believed represented a rebirth of true Christianity. 
Smith, however, did much more than publish a new book; he organized a community. 
Within a month of the book’s publication, the fi rst Mormon community began 
to form near Palmyra, New York, with Smith as its leader. Some responded with hostility 
to his eff orts, even tarring and feathering Smith at one point. But converts seeking 
religious truth poured in, a temple was built, and the community grew. 
In response to the hostility, Smith and the Mormon community moved fi rst to 
Missouri and then in the late 1830s, to Nauvoo, Illinois, which became the largest 
and fastest growing city in Illinois because of Mormonism. Th e city’s 15,000 residents 
10.1 
10.2 

Chapter 10 Democracy in the Age of Andrew Jackson 313 
10.3 
became a virtually autonomous state, and their militia was recognized by state law. But 
Smith’s political involvements and religious teaching, especially his suggestion that all 
members participate in marriages involving one husband and multiple wives, brought 
renewed hostility. On June 27, 1844, a mob killed Smith and his brother Hyrum. 
With Smith’s death, Brigham Young became the new leader of the Mormons in 
1847 and led them on a cross-continent trek to the shores of the Great Salt Lake in 
what is now Utah. Salt Lake was then on the northern edge of the Republic of Mexico, 
which was soon to be annexed by the United States. Th ere, far from any governmental 
authority, they set up settlements in a tight, church-regulated community. Th ey also 
embraced Smith’s revelation that a man could take as many wives as he could support. 
But the Treaty of Guadalupe Hildago, which marked the end of the U.S. War 
with Mexico from 1846 to 1848, brought Salt Lake City and the Mormon community 
under the control of the U.S. government. For a while, the U.S. government left 
the Mormons alone, but in 1857, President James Buchanan replaced Young with a 
non-Mormon territorial governor, and the Mormon War broke out as federal authorities 
tried to enforce monogamy on the Mormons and the Mormons fought back. In 
one well-publicized incident, Mormons massacred a group of non-Mormon settlers. 
Only in 1890, aft er an intense time of prayer and a new revelation, did the Mormon 
leadership abandon plural marriage. Relations with the government improved, and 
Utah became a state in 1896. Of all the new religious communities spawned during 
the Second Great Awakening, the Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter-Day Saints has 
been the most successful. 
Transcendentalism 
In 1838, far from Salt Lake City or the revivals of New York, Ralph Waldo Emerson 
gave a speech at Harvard Divinity School in Cambridge, Massachusetts, that had as 
much impact as any revival sermon. Emerson had been ordained as a Unitarian minister 
but had resigned when he came to believe that the Lord’s Supper and public prayer 
were barriers to direct experience of the divine. 
In the Divinity School Address , Emerson told an audience of future Unitarian ministers 
that too oft en in formal worship, “Th e soul is not preached.” And he said, “Th e 
true preacher can be known by this, that he deals out to the people his life,—life passed 
through the fi re of thought.” Emerson’s call to preach “throbs of desire and hope” 
rather than formal theology off ended most of his audience and he was never invited 
back to the Divinity School, but the speech represented a new approach to religious 
life that was developing in America in the 1830s. 
While Emerson continued to develop his ideas for another 40 years, the 
Transcendentalist movement with which he is most associated blossomed in the 1830s. 
In 1836, a group that came to call themselves the Transcendental Club met at the 
Boston home of George Ripley, another Unitarian minister, to discuss ideas. Th e members 
of the club created a theology that refl ected a powerful personal experience of life. 
In 1841, under Ripley’s leadership, members of the Transcendental Club founded 
Brook Farm, a utopian community in West Roxbury, Massachusetts, where the 
residents sought to support themselves through manual labor. Women and men 
shared work equally, and an effort was made at true gender equity. But few of the 
residents of Brook Farm actually knew much about farming, the farm did not prosper, 
and the community disbanded in 1847. Nevertheless, Emerson’s writings and 
the Transcendental movement he helped launch refl ected an impatience with “old 
ways” and a desire for direct and immediate experience of the divine that continued to 
impact American religious life.

DEMOCRATIZED EDUCATION: THE BIRTH OF THE 
COMMON SCHOOL 
Explain the development of public education as a result of, and in response to, the cultural 
currents of the 1820s and 1830s. 
The years during which Andrew Jackson dominated American politics were also 
years in which the nation’s public school system was radically transformed, though 
the transformation was mostly the work of Jackson’s staunch opponents. Many of the 
most prominent education reformers were Whigs who did not share Jackson’s vision 
for American society. Th ey oft en sought to change the ways schools were organized 
and conducted for the same reasons they opposed Jackson politically. Schools, Whig 
educators believed, could build a new American culture more to their liking than the 
Jacksonian brand of democracy that most school reformers found too individualistic 
and unlikely to transmit the kind of moral code they thought was essential to a wellregulated 
national life. 
Various individuals with their own agendas contributed to what came to be 
known as the Common School Crusade. Catherine Beecher sought to empower 
women by opening the doors for them to become school teachers. Horace Mann, a 
Whig Party leader, helped launch a new and more tightly organized school system in 
Massachusetts—a system that came to serve as a model for much of the nation. Th e 
transformation of the nation’s schools in this period was a key dynamic of the changing 
culture of the United States between the 1820s and the 1840s. 
Women Become Teachers 
In 1835, Catharine Beecher, daughter of the religious leader Lyman Beecher, was 
already well known for founding the Hartford Female Seminary to help educate 
women and for her petitions seeking to stop Jackson’s Indian Removal. In her Essay on 
the Education of Female Teachers published in that year, Beecher argued that women 
were much better equipped than men to be teachers, but she also wanted to educate 
them for the work. She saw teaching as an extension of motherhood, a nurturing role: 
“What is the most important and peculiar duty of the female sex? It is the physical, 
10.3 
Women, mostly very young women, taught school, most often in one-room schools like this one where 
children of all ages learned to read, write, count, and then advance through more complex assignments. 
Not all the schools were as comfortable as the one shown here and not all the children were as 
well behaved. 

Chapter 10 Democracy in the Age of Andrew Jackson 315

intellectual, and moral education of children.” She continued, “Woman, whatever are 
her relations in life, is necessarily the guardian of the nursery, the companion of childhood, 
and the constant model of imitation. It is her hand that fi rst stamps impressions 
on the immortal spirit, that must remain forever.” At a time when most teachers were 
still men, Beecher argued not only that women actually made better teachers than 
men, but also that including women as teachers would expand the supply of teachers 
for the country and open the door to a professional life for middle-class women who 
had few employment options. 
Beecher’s impassioned views refl ected those of Emma Willard, who had founded 
Troy Female Seminary in 1821 in upstate New York to prepare women to be teachers. 
Like Beecher, Willard had argued, “Th ere are many females of ability, to whom the 
business of instructing children is highly acceptable.” She also believed that women 
should get the same education as men and modeled the curriculum at Troy on what 
men studied at college, though she added courses on how to teach. In 1837, Mary 
Lyon founded Mount Holyoke Female Seminary in Massachusetts to give future 
female teachers a college education. 
New Structures for Schooling 
While Catharine Beecher and her colleagues were transforming the gender of the 
teaching profession, other reformers sought to transform the structure of schools. 
None of these leaders was more important than Horace Mann. In 1836, Mann, a 
rising star in the Massachusetts Whig Party, helped shepherd a bill through the 
Massachusetts legislature that created a state Board of Education. He then became 
the board’s full-time, paid secretary. Mann spent the next 12 years advocating tighter 
state standards for education, more money for schools and teacher salaries, and a 
better education for children. He became the best-known spokesperson for public 
education of his generation. 
Mann believed in state standards for the schools. He described the schools of 
Massachusetts as, “so many distinct, independent communities.” Mann meant to 
change that. He also believed that it was the responsibility of all citizens to pay taxes 
to support schools; looking at the conditions of the state’s schools when he took offi ce, 
he did not think that they paid nearly enough at the time in such taxes. Like Beecher 
and Willard, Mann wanted educated teachers and created a system of state-sponsored 
teacher preparation schools, called “normal schools,” that offered 1 year of statefunded 
preparation to any young woman or man who wanted to be a teacher. Mann’s 
greatest concern, however, was the moral education of the state’s citizens. He believed 
that there needed to be a public guardian of morality, and since the United States had 
no state church, that guardian had to be the public school. 
While Mann was the best-known educational reformer, almost all Whigs also 
came to advocate the same changes he did: state systems of education, state support 
for teacher preparation, and state eff orts to ensure a common morality. Like many 
reformers, Mann and his allies could not understand why anyone would oppose them. 
Yet even in Massachusetts, there was opposition. Jacksonian Democrats in the legislature 
tried to abolish the Board of Education and the offi ce of secretary. Th ey saw 
the state control that Mann advocated as expensive, unnecessary, and an unwarranted 
interference by the state in local aff airs, which would undermine local support for 
each town’s school. 
Roman Catholics were especially unhappy with the growing infl uence and cost of 
the public school system. Catholics saw the public schools as essentially a Protestant 
venture, something Protestants like Mann could never understand. Mann advocated 
teaching the Protestant Bible in school “without note or comment,” leaving it to 
churches or parents to interpret it. But Catholics believed that the Bible should be 
read in light of the teachings of the Church and not left to individual interpretation. 

316 Part IV Crafting a Nation, People, Land, and a National Identity, 1800–1848 
10.2 
Th ey found anti-Catholic bias in many of the textbooks the public schools used. To 
pay taxes only to have their children read such material outraged them. Citing examples 
from textbooks that spoke of “deceitful Catholics,” Catholics in New York City 
wrote that they could not “in conscience, and consistently with their sense of duty to 
God, and to their off spring” send them to the city’s public schools and requested public 
funds so that they could operate their own schools. When such funds were denied, 
Catholics in New York and around the country started their own parochial system at 
their own expense. 
The Nation’s Textbook: McGuff ey’s Reader 
In 1836, the small Cincinnati publishing house of Truman and Smith brought out 
a new textbook for schools. Th e fi rst McGuff ey’s Reader became part of a series, the 
McGuffey’s Primer , McGuffey’s Speller , and the First through the Sixth McGuffey’s 
Eclectic Readers . By 1920, when most school districts had turned to other materials, 
122 million copies of the books had been sold. 
Th e McGuff ey Reader off ered lessons in reading and public speaking designed to 
create a unifi ed, literate, and patriotic society. Th e Readers refl ected the same morality 
that Mann and Beecher wanted the schools to teach. Th ey included patriotic speeches 
by Patrick Henry and stories of George Washington as well as tales of the poor boy 
and his faithful dog or the poor boy who worked hard and made good. Th e texts also 
included ethical instruction, for example, don’t steal apples from someone else’s tree, 
and instruction in how to speak and present oneself. Th e goal was a citizenry that 
could speak well, participate in a common democratic dialogue, and use a common 
national language instead of regional dialects. 
A story in the Second Eclectic Reader is illustrative of the McGuffey approach. 
“Henry, the Bootblack,” begins with the story of Henry, “a kind good boy.” 
Henry’s “father was dead, and his mother was very poor. He had 
a little sister about two years old.” One day, Henry found a pocketbook. 
He could have kept all the money in it, but he found the 
owner and returned it. The owner then gave him a dollar for doing 
so. Henry used the dollar to set himself up as a bootblack and he was 
“so polite that gentlemen soon began to notice him, and to let him 
black their boots.” When Henry brought home his first fifty cents in 
earnings his mother responded, “You are a dear, good boy, Henry. I 
did not know how I could earn enough to buy bread with, but now I 
think we can manage to get along quite well.” This account is not the 
kind of success story that would appear fifty years later. In the story, 
Henry does not go on to own a factory or make a fortune. He is simply 
a dutiful child who makes his mother happy. The students who 
read the McGuffey texts were urged to do the same. They were also 
urged to learn the correct pronunciation and spelling for support, 
boots, notice, money, and other words in the story. McGuffey was 
teaching a common morality but also a common American English 
to all students. 
The United States that the Readers portrayed was white, middle 
class, hard working, and willing to sacrifice for the common good. 
The Readers also demanded a high standard of reading ability and 
moved students step by step to attain it. In one-room schoolhouses, 
oft en staff ed by teachers with little training, which was the national 
norm throughout the 1800s, a teacher could encourage diff erent students 
to move from Reader to Reader in careful order and be confi dent 
that, by the time the student had mastered the Sixth Eclectic Reader, 
he or she would be fl uent in the English language and in the nation’s 
The McGuff ey Readers were fi lled with patriotic speeches and stories 
like the one shown here, designed to teach morality, in addition to 
instruction on common ways of pronouncing key terms.

ethical norms. Not everyone agreed with the specific values the Readers taught, 
and reformers were oft en tone-deaf to complaints, but the public schools and their 
teachers shaped American culture as signifi cantly as any of the religious, political, or 
commercial ventures of the Age of Jackson.

CONCLUSION 
Andrew Jackson was like no other president before him. He had no connection to the 
Founding Fathers, either by blood, class, or any similar privilege. Jackson was determined 
to make the presidency the center of American government, believing that the 
government should be an expression of his agenda and of his party. In his two terms 
as president, Jackson successfully prodded Congress to bend to his will or used executive 
power to realize his goals, despite fi erce opposition. A complex American leader 
with a long-standing distrust of centralized government, his views were refl ected in 
his actions: an Indian Removal policy that forced thousands of Native Americans out 
of their ancestral homes in Illinois, Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida and on 
to new lands in present-day Oklahoma; opposition to the Second Bank of the United 
States because he thought the federal government should have no role in banking, issuing 
paper currency, or expanding credit; and the Nullifi cation Crisis in which Jackson 
successfully challenged South Carolina’s eff orts to declare federal law null and void in 
that state. Th ose actions would have long-lasting eff ects on the nation. 
For many Americans in the decades between 1820 and 1850, the growth of a more 
popular democracy and popular social movements led by ordinary citizens were far 
more important than President Jackson’s policies or opinions. Along with the market 
revolution that was transforming the physical, commercial, and political landscapes 
of the United States, the Age of Jackson, as his years in the White House were 
called, was also a period of social and religious revival and reform. It was the peak of a 
long-running series of religious revivals known as the Second Great Awakening. Th is 
upsurge in religious activity resulted in greater rights for women, stronger opposition 
to slavery, and radical transformation of the nation’s public schools, whose teachers 
and moral teachings shaped American culture as signifi cantly as any of the religious, 
political, or commercial ventures of the Age of Jackson. 
Considering the political, economic, and social aspects of the “Age of Jackson,” 
to what extent was the United States in that period different from the beginning 
of the 1800s?

expressions. 
Summary 
Th e Second Great Awakening began in the 1790s and reached 
its height in the decades between 1820 and 1850. Th e fervent 
and emotional Protestantism that was at the heart of the movement 
came to have an enormous infl uence on the nation’s cultural 
and political life. Th e religious revivals led by ministers 
like Charles G. Finney epitomized a number of aspects of the 
Second Great Awakening, including support for the abolition 
of slavery, the participation of women in society, and links to 
social reform. Th is period also saw the emergence of numerous 
utopian religious communities, including the Shakers, the 
Oneida Community, the New Harmony Community, and the 
Mormons. Transcendentalism off ered yet another alternative to 
traditional religion.

JACKSONIAN DEMOCRACY 
10.1 
Analyze Jackson’s advocacy for Indian Removal, his opposition 
to the Bank of the United States, his support for a tariff, and the 
impact of these policies on other Americans. 
Summary 
Andrew Jackson began his fi rst term as president by replacing 
senior federal offi ce holders with his political allies. Jackson was 
intent on making the presidency the center of American government. 
Jackson’s priorities were Indian removal, the scaling 
back of tariff s and government projects, the destruction of the 
Bank of the United States, and the preservation of the Union 
in the face of southern advocates of nullifi cation. Although the 
Five Civilized Tribes (the Cherokees, Chickasaws, Choctaws, 
Creeks, and Seminoles), living in the Old Southwest, Arkansas, 
and Florida, had adopted many white ways and customs, intermarried 
with whites, and created a unique culture based on 
settled farming and the production of goods, white settlers and 
President Jackson were determined to seize their land. Indian 
leaders rallied many whites to their side, but Indian Removal 
was approved by a narrow margin by Congress and was a disaster 
for the Five Civilized Tribes. 
In terms of economics, Jackson blamed the Bank of the 
United States for the Panic of 1819 and saw it as an elitist threat 
to democracy. Jackson waged war against the rechartered bank, 
a war that culminated in the bank’s destruction. Another battle 
over the issue of nullification pitted Jackson against John C. 
Calhoun of South Carolina, who had been vice president during 
Jackson’s fi rst term. Th e so-called Tariff of Abominations, 
passed in 1828, brought to the fore the issue of a state’s right to 
declare any federal law null and void. Despite eff orts at compromise, 
in 1832 the South Carolina legislature declared the 
tariffs of 1828 and 1832 unconstitutional and raised a state 
militia. Jackson responded with a proclamation denying South 
Carolina’s right to nullify a federal law, and he prepared to send 
federal troops to the state. In the end, South Carolina backed 
down, but neither side admitted defeat. In his two terms in 
offi ce, Jackson realized most of his goals, establishing permanent 
precedents for presidential authority in the process.

SCHOOL 
10.3 
Explain the development of public education as a result of, and

Summary 
American women began to argue that teaching was a natural 
fit with women’s nature and aptitudes, and schools to train 
women to be teachers proliferated in the fi rst half of the 1800s. 
Male reformers sought to transform education itself. Horace 
Mann led the fight for mandatory, standardized public education. 
Mann’s Jacksonian opponents saw public schools as 
undemocratic and unnecessary. Many Roman Catholics 
opposed public schools because they saw them as tools for the 
conversion of their children to Protestant values. Th e McGuff ey 
Reader became the standard reading and public speaking 
textbook in the United States. Th e Readers combined practical 
instruction with indoctrination into the ethical norms of white 
middle-class Protestant America.

Manifest Destiny: 
Expanding the Nation 
In the summer of 1845, the Democratic Review, a New York City paper 
edited by John L. O’Sullivan, urged the nation to annex the independent 
Republic of Texas: “It is time now for opposition to the annexation of 
Texas to cease,” Sullivan wrote. Texas was a hot topic, and many newspapers 
were taking the same position. But the Review claimed that including Texas 
in the United States was an essential part of the “fulfi llment of our manifest 
destiny to overspread the continent allotted by Providence for the free 
development of our yearly multiplying millions.” Manifest Destiny quickly 
became a core American belief. It was a mindset that justifi ed the Louisiana 
Purchase of 1803, the hoped-for U.S. acquisition of the Oregon Territory 
along with the northern half of Mexico including Texas and California, and 
a signifi cant infl uence across the Pacifi c Ocean. 
Manifest Destiny gave a new name to an old idea. Even before the 
American Revolution and in growing numbers in the 1790s, white 
Americans had crossed the Allegheny Mountains in spite of government 
prohibitions and had established colonies in Kentucky and in the 
Ohio River Valley. Soon aft er 1800, others were crossing into Florida and 
Missouri, both then under Spanish control. In both cases, the settlers were 
confi dent that the American army and American government would soon 
follow. While the fi rst Americans to cross into Texas spoke of loyalty to the

Manifest Destiny 
The doctrine, first expressed in 1845, that 
the expansion of white Americans across the 
continent was inevitable and ordained by 
God and was a means to spread Protestant 
Christianity and Jacksonian Democracy to 
more people. 
Republic of Mexico, by 1830, they too were seeking protection from the American 
government. In all these cases, many in the government were happy to oblige, seeing 
the movement of colonists as a fi rst step in expanding the nation. Being aware of 
the nation’s long-term expansion, the power of the idea of Manifest Destiny, and the 
political and military actions that the nation’s leaders took in the name of that idea is 
essential to understanding how the nation expanded into the shape it has today. Th is 
chapter will explore the political, diplomatic, and military issues involved in turning 
the idea of Manifest Destiny into a geographic reality. 
It is also important to understand how the acquisition of so much new territory in 
the 1830s and 1840s, as well as other developments in people’s thinking, changed the 
lives of those who lived in the United States. Th e population of the country was expanding 
as dramatically as its geographical borders. Migrants from around the world especially 
fl ocked to California to fi nd their fortunes in the gold. Citizens of the Republic of 
Mexico suddenly found themselves living in the United States because the border had 
moved, as did American Indians, who rejected the claims of all nations to their lands. 
Other immigrants came to the already established parts of the nation. In addition, amid 
the many changes, slaves, supporters and opponents of slavery, and women became 
increasingly vocal about the issue of freedom and equality. Th ese issues will be explored 
in Chapter 12 . Th e great territorial expansion of these years and dramatic changes in the 
makeup and the thinking of people in the United States during the same time period 
transformed the country and its future. 
MANIFEST DESTINY—THE IMPORTANCE OF AN IDEA 
Explain what Manifest Destiny meant and how it led the United States to involvement in 
Texas, California, and Oregon. 
The idea that the United States had a “manifest destiny” led to more than simply 
acquiring land, though between 1845 and 1848, the United States would almost double 
in size, from 1.8 million square miles to almost 3 million. Advocates of Manifest 
Destiny claimed that the United States—with God’s blessing—should rule the heart of 
North America from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacifi c and from a still-to-be-defi ned 
border with British Canada to an even more undefi ned border with the Republic of 
Mexico. For O’Sullivan and other supporters of Manifest Destiny, it was the nation’s 
appointed role to spread not only democracy—in its Jacksonian form—but also to 
spread Protestant Christianity in place of the Catholicism of Mexico or the native 
beliefs of American Indians. Th e same year that O’Sullivan coined the term Manifest 
Destiny , Illinois Representative John Wentworth told Congress that he “did not believe 
the God of Heaven…designed that the original States should be the only abode of liberty 
on earth. On the contrary, he only designed them as the great center from which 
civilization, religion, and liberty should radiate and radiate until the whole continent 
shall bask in their blessing.” Th at belief, held by many beyond Wentworth, that the 
United States was specially chosen by divine will to bring liberty and democracy to the 
planet—and especially North America—was a driving force in the push for new lands 
in the 1840s. 
Many Americans supported versions of Manifest Destiny for their own reasons. 
Land speculators and those promoting the extension of the nation’s railroads wanted 
to exploit the vast lands in the West. Farmers dreamed of starting over in rich—and 
cheap—new lands. Workers believed that rapid national expansion would guarantee 
industrial profi ts and thus their jobs, or give them a chance to start over if necessary. 
Protestant leaders and missionaries saw U.S. control of the new lands as an opportunity 
to ensure that a Protestant United States, not a Catholic Mexico, controlled the 
continent. Manifest Destiny also referred to a patriotic belief that the nation had a 
divine mission to become a world power.

In contrast, many other Americans opposed the whole idea of a “manifest destiny.” 
Democrats tended to support expansion, but most Whigs, led by Henry Clay, had 
grave reservations. Clay’s goal was not necessarily a larger country but a better developed 
one with roads, canals, railroads, and industries knitting it together and ensuring 
its prosperity. Antislavery advocates opposed the acquisition of more land, especially 
Texas, since they were certain that new lands meant new slave states. However, some 
proslavery advocates, notably South Carolina Senator John C. Calhoun, wanted Texas 
but worried that other incorporated lands, especially California and Oregon, might 
become free states peopled by darker-skinned citizens, which would shift power away 
from the white slaveholding regions. 
Some Americans also saw the violence associated with expansion as simply wrong. 
Many residents of the lands from Texas to California did not want to become part 
of the United States at all. Antonio Maria Osio spoke for those who did not want 
to become U.S. residents when he described himself as “a californio who loves his 
country and a Mexican on all four sides and in my heart.” He opposed the annexation 
of California to the United States, and when it happened, he left , eventually settling in 
Baja California so that he could to remain a citizen of Mexico. 
While many Americans debated Manifest Destiny in the Congress, the press, 
and the pulpits, other Americans, especially trappers and farmers, moved into the 
regions, just as a generation before the same types of people had expanded beyond the 
Mississippi. Regardless of whether the United States, Mexico, or Britain claimed the 
land, these frontiersmen and women were confi dent that, in time, their government 
would follow them. Most of all, they moved into Texas (see Map 11-1 ). 
The Birth of the Texas Republic 
Th e tensions between Americans living in Texas and the Mexican government that 
governed it had been building even before Mexico gained its independence from Spain 
in 1821. When the United States purchased Louisiana from France in 1803, the western

At the mythical level, Manifest Destiny was seen as the spirit hovering over the westward movement of white 
settlers, leading them and urging them on whether they came by foot, covered wagon, or stage coach.

border of the territory was disputed. Spain insisted it was the Sabine River (the current 
border between Louisiana and Texas), but French offi cials hinted that the United States 
might claim territory further west. Jeff erson had wanted Louisiana to include all of the 
land from modern-day Texas to the Rio Grande River, but he was not prepared to fi ght 
Spain over it. In the Adams-Onís Treaty of 1819, Spain ceded Florida to the United 
States, along with Spanish claims to Oregon, in exchange for U.S. recognition of the 
Sabine River as the border between U.S. Louisiana and Spanish Texas, though some in 
Congress criticized the treaty for that reason. Despite treaties, however, Americans still 
crossed the Sabine in the early 19th century settling in Texas. 
Soon aft er the Adams-Onís Treaty was signed, a revolutionary uprising began in 
Mexico. Like the people of the United States, most Mexican citizens wanted to be free 
of control by a European power. Th e Mexican revolution against Spanish rule, which 
lasted from 1810 to 1821, was long and bloody and decimated the Mexican economy. 
In Texas, the Mexican population, people known as Tejanos , fell from 4,000 in 1800 
to 2,500 in 1821. Comanche and Apache tribes dominated large parts of Texas, and 
much of the desert was vacant of any human habitation. Nevertheless, after 1821, 
Mexico had won its independence.

had established settlements and trade networks throughout its sparsely populated northern territories. 
Texas trade ran not only south from San Antonio and Goliad in Texas to Monterrey and other trading centers 
in Mexico but also east into the United States. Separate networks connected the heartland of Mexico with 
its settlements in Santa Fe and Taos in New Mexico, with Tucson in the future Arizona, and with the missions 
and presidios along the coast of California.

With the establishment of the Republic of Mexico, two independent republics— 
the English-speaking, overwhelmingly Protestant United States in the north and the 
Spanish-speaking and mostly Catholic Republic of Mexico to the south— bordered 
each other at the Sabine River, with settlers from one living in the territory of 
the other. 
Even before Mexican independence, the Spanish government had given Missouri 
merchant Moses Austin permission to start a colony in Texas, believing that more 
settlers—whatever their origin—would help stabilize a border area that was far from 
the population centers of either Mexico or the United States. In 1821, Moses’s son 
Stephen F. Austin, along with Erasmo Seguín, a Tejano with liberal political views, 
rode into Texas to build the new settlement. A month later, Austin and his party 
learned that Mexico had won its independence. Austin then went to Mexico City 
where he met with Mexico’s new leader Agustín de Iturbide and announced, “I make 
a tender of my services, my loyalty, and my fi delity to the Constitutional Emperor of 
Mexico.” Austin’s physical presence in Mexico City and willingness to make an oath 
of allegiance to the new nation impressed the new government. In April 1823, Austin 
received confi rmation of his claims to a huge swath of land in Texas and his right to 
act as an empresario , or colonizing agent, for this land. He was the only American to 
get such rights. 
At fi rst, the new American colony grew slowly, but Austin continued to recruit 
settlers. Th e Mexican government, aware that it could do little to stop settlement and 
anxious for a buff er against Indian tribes and the United States, hoped that settlers in 
Texas would create a stable population of loyal citizens. 
Few Europeans and even fewer Mexicans moved into Texas, but Americans 
came in large numbers. The Tejano community was overwhelmed by the newly 
arrived Americans. By 1830, 20,000 American colonists had arrived and had brought 
2,000 slaves with them. Th e Americans generally ignored the requirement that they 
convert to Catholicism, though they did not build Protestant churches, and most 
absolutely refused to free their slaves in spite of the fact that Mexico had abolished 
slavery in 1829 and expected the residents of Texas to obey that decree. One American 
visitor to Texas, Amos Parker, wrote, “A person may travel all day; and day aft er day, 
and fi nd Americans only.” Th ose in the Tejano community were also divided. Many 
Tejanos profi ted from trade with the Americans and identifi ed with their independent 
streak. Others clung to their connection to Mexico. Distance, diffi cult travel conditions, 
and an unstable government in Mexico City with more pressing concerns closer 
to home allowed an American community to develop in Texas that was officially 
governed by one set of laws but lived by its own rules (see Map 11-2 ). 
Th e Mexican government’s benign neglect of the American community in Texas 
ended in 1830 when the Mexican Congress closed Texas to further American immigration 
and the importation of slaves. Mexico also insisted that trade be routed 
through established ports further south in Mexico rather than directly between Texas 
and the United States. Th e government stationed more soldiers in Texas to enforce the 
new rules. Austin was stunned, and revolts broke out in the English-speaking colonies, 
a few of which drew Tejano support. 
In 1832 Mexican troops defeated an American eff ort to take control of an army 
garrison, but in October, American colonists met at San Felipe and called for autonomy 
for Texas within the Republic of Mexico. In 1833, they organized an army under 
the command of Sam Houston and sent Austin to Mexico City to negotiate for them. 
Tejanos were not represented in these meetings, and most of the 5,000 Tejanos probably 
opposed these actions. But by now, there were 30,000 Americans in Texas, and 
the Tejanos were greatly outnumbered. Austin had little success in Mexico City. He 
was arrested in the fall of 1833 and at the time of his release from jail in the summer of 
1835 he wrote, “War is our only recourse. Th ere is no other remedy.” Most Americans 
in Texas seemed to agree.

Although revolt had been brewing since 1830, the campaign 
for the independence of Texas became a full-fledged war late in 
1835 when American volunteers captured the Alamo fortress at 
San Antonio de Bexar from its Mexican garrison. In January and 
February 1836, James Bowie and William Travis took joint command 
of the Alamo, while another Texian (as the Americans in 
Texas were called) force remained in the town of Goliad under 
the command of James Fannin. Austin went to Washington, D.C., 
to try to secure American support for the insurrection while Sam 
Houston took command of a volunteer army based at the Texian’s 
temporary capital of Washington-on-the-Brazos. 
In response to these military actions, Mexican president Santa 
Anna ordered the Mexican army north, capturing the Alamo 
and killing its defenders in March 1836. Aft er a furious fi ght, the 
nearly 200 defenders of the Alamo, including former Tennessee 
Congressman Davy Crockett, adventurer Jim Bowie, and the garrison’s 
commander William B. Travis, were killed. It is estimated 
that 600 Mexican soldiers were also killed in the assault. Th e defeat 
and grisly deaths of the Alamo’s outnumbered defenders entered 
Texas—and American—legend. “Remember the Alamo!” became 
a rallying cry for the independence of Texas and later in the war 
with Mexico. 
Aft er his victory at the Alamo, Santa Anna marched his army 
to the second Texan garrison at Goliad, which surrendered in late 
March. Santa Anna ordered his soldiers to execute all of the Goliad 
troops and some 341, including the garrison’s commander James 
Fannin, died on the spot. For some, the phrase quickly became 
“Remember the Alamo and Goliad.” 
While Texian volunteers fought against the Mexican army, 
political leaders in the American colony met in convention at 
Washington-on-the-Brazos and on March 2, 1836, declared the 
independence of the Republic of Texas and adopted a constitution. 
Having defeated the insurgent forces at the Alamo and at Goliad, Santa Anna had little 
use for the Texas declaration. He turned on Sam Houston’s army, the only remaining 
defenders of the Republic of Texas and its new constitution. Houston, mindful 
of Santa Anna’s strength, began a slow retreat. Th en, aft er Santa Anna’s troops had 
been marching for days with an increasingly thin supply line, Houston suddenly 
turned on them. On April 21, 1836, Houston defeated Santa Anna at the Battle of San 
Jacinto. Houston’s troops showed no more mercy than Santa Anna had and executed 
hundreds of Mexican prisoners. Th e next day, Santa Anna himself was captured and 
forced to sign the Treaty of Velasco, promising to withdraw all Mexican troops from 
Texas, end the war, and recognize the independence of Texas. Th e Mexican Congress 
refused to recognize the treaty, but neither the Mexican government nor the Texians 
were in the mood for more fi ghting. 
In the early fall of 1836, Sam Houston, the hero of the Battle of San Jacinto, was 
elected president of the new republic defeating Austin, who became secretary of state. 
Both men, and most of their followers, did not want long-term independence but 
rather annexation by the United States. However, the United States was a reluctant 
partner. Texas would be a new huge slave state, and many in Washington worried 
about the destabilizing impact on the nation of having such a powerful addition to the 
slave states in the U.S. Senate. In addition, U.S. trade with Mexico was too important 
to trifl e with. Even Andrew Jackson did not want to risk the political cost of annexing 
Texas, especially in 1836 when Martin Van Buren, his handpicked successor, was 
in the midst of the presidential election. Aft er the election, Jackson, a good friend of

of Texas were highly contested in the 1830s and 1840s. The Adams-Onís 
Treaty of 1819 had fi xed the border between the two nations as the Sabine 
River—the border between modern Louisiana and Texas. Austin’s land grant 
from the Mexican government allowed him to settle to the west of that line. 
Most people considered the Nueces River to be the western border of the 
Republic of Texas in the 1830s and 1840s, but at President Polk’s insistence, 
the Rio Grande River became the border as a result of the Treaty of Guadalupe 
Hidalgo in 1848, which tripled the total size of Texas.

neighbor to the north would go. Th e Texas Republic would stand on its own for the 
immediate future. 
Distant California 
While Texas was declaring its independence from Mexico, Alta California, as it was 
known to distinguish it from Baja California to the south, was a sleepy and distant 
outpost of the Republic of Mexico, and most people in Mexico and the United States 
were content to leave it that way. California had wonderful harbors, large and prosperous 
rancheros, and a string of missions, but it was a long way from the heart of either 
nation. In the 1830s, the population there included not only Mexicans, most of whom 
valued self-government in local matters and cared little for the authorities in Mexico 
City, but also a much smaller number of Americans. Neither group was thinking seriously 
about independence. A majority among the declining number of American 
Indians in California were doing their best to maintain their tribal ways and keep their 
distance from both Mexican and American settlers, though some of them were living 
under the supervision of the missions. 
Although Spanish explorers had sailed the coast of California and claimed the 
lands in the 16th century, meaningful European settlements in California began only 
in the mid-18th century, just before the American Revolution. In 1769, a Franciscan 
priest, Father Junípero Serra, was sent to Alta California with instructions to found 
a chain of missions that would aid in converting the California Indians to Catholic 
Christianity, put them to work for the Spanish, and establish a stronger Spanish presence 
to protect against possible Russian expansion. 
Father Serra and his Franciscan successors succeeded in establishing a chain of 
missions stretching from San Diego to San Francisco. Th e Franciscan friars meant 
to save the Indian souls and bring them the gifts of Spanish culture, but they also 
worked them hard to ensure a good economic return for the missions, maintaining 
tight control and a tough discipline. One of the Franciscan friars noted, however, that 
the Indians “live well free but as soon as we reduce them to a Christian and community 
life…they fatten, sicken, and die.” When Serra arrived in California, there were 
probably 300,000 Indians in the area, but by the time Spanish rule ended in 1821, that 
number had been reduced to 200,000. From the Spanish government’s perspective, 
however, the missions were signifi cant in asserting sovereignty as they controlled the 
Indian work force and managed the colony’s cattle, grain, and trade. 
Th e Franciscans administered the California missions until 1833 when the Mexican 
government, which had seized power from Spain in 1821, transferred ownership of 
the missions from church to state and eventually to private hands. Mexico’s revolution 
was partly a rejection not only of Spanish royal authority but also of the power of 
the Catholic Church, and seizing the missions was a means to that end. Missions were 
sold off or awarded to powerful ranchers. 
As late as 1821, California’s total Mexican population was about 3,000, though 
it grew to between 10,000 and 15,000 by 1846. Th e majority lived on large ranches 
spread along the coast. Some few immigrants from the United States also moved to 
California in these years. Most of the Americans arriving before 1840 learned Spanish, 
converted to Catholicism, took on Mexican citizenship, and became part of the local 
culture of Alta California. 
Beginning in the 1840s, however, a different group of immigrants from the 
United States began to arrive who were more interested in making California part of 
the United States. Even before the war with Mexico began, President Polk, well aware 
of the interests of these recent immigrants to California, told Congress that California’s 
harbors “would aff ord shelter for our navy, for our numerous whale ships, and other 
merchant vessels employed in the Pacifi c Ocean, and would in a short period become 
the marts of an extensive and profi table commerce with China, and other countries of

the East.” Polk’s Secretary of the Navy George Bancroft anticipated the coming of war 
with Mexico and ordered Commodore John D. Sloat, commander of the U.S. Pacifi c 
squadron, based in the nation of Hawaii, to land in San Francisco if war came. At the 
same time, U.S. Army Captain John C. Frémont led what he claimed was a military 
map-making expedition overland from St. Louis, arriving in Monterey, California, 
in late December 1845. Frémont told the Mexican authorities he was simply exploring. 
Th ey had their doubts that he was just making maps—doubts that later turned 
out to be well founded—but allowed him to remain. Th en in April 1846, a U.S. warship 
arrived at Monterey, with orders for Frémont and the U.S. counsel in California, 
Th omas Oliver Larkin, to stir up a pro-American revolt in California. Th e once distant 
outpost was quickly becoming an important focus of attention in the growing tensions 
between the United States and Mexico. 
Manifest Destiny and American Presidential Politics 
Th e creation of the Democratic Party as a vehicle to continue his political philosophy and 
support his handpicked successors was one of Jackson’s most signifi cant achievements. 
Th e twin pillars on which the party rested were a small federal government and the idea of 
Eulalia Perez was born about 1768 in Baja California. She and 
her husband first moved to the Alta California mission of San 
Diego and then to San Gabriel near Los Angeles. At San Gabriel, the 
priests selected her as cook for the mission where she also served 
as a midwife and eventually “keeper of the keys” or mayordoma — 
head of the mission household. Perez lived a long life, and in 1877, 
a historian at the University of California interviewed her on her 
memories of a much earlier era in California history. Her account 
provides a rare glimpse of mission life in California before that area’s 
acquisition by the United States. 
When we arrived here, Father Jose Sanchez lodged me and 
my family temporarily in a small house until work could be found 
for me.…He, as well as his companion Father Jose Maria Zalvidea, 
treated the Indians very well, and the two were much loved by 
the Spanish-speaking people and by the neophytes [Indians 
recently converted to Christianity] and other Indians. 
Father Zalvidea introduced many improvements in the 
Mission of San Gabriel and made it progress a very great deal in 
every way. Not content with providing abundantly for the neophytes, 
he planted [fruit] trees in the mountains, far away from 
the mission, in order that the untamed Indians might have food 
when they passed by those spots.… 
In the morning the girls were let out. First they went to Father 
Zalvidea’s Mass, for he spoke the Indian language; afterwards they 
went to the mess hut to have breakfast, which sometimes consisted 
of corn gruel with chocolate, and on holidays with sweets 
and bread. On other days, ordinarily they had boiled barley and 
beans and meat. After breakfast each girl began the task that had 
been assigned to her beforehand—sometimes it was at the looms, 
or unloading, or sewing, or whatever there was to be done.… 
The Indians were taught the various jobs for which they 
showed an aptitude. Others worked in the fields, or took care of 
the horses, cattle, etc. Still others were carters, oxherds, etc.… 
The Indians also were taught to pray. A few of the more intelligent 
ones were taught to read and write. Father Zalvidea taught 
the Indians to pray in their Indian tongue; some Indians learned 
music and played instruments and sang at Mass. The sextons and 
pages who helped with Mass were Indians of the mission. 
The punishments that were meted out were the stocks and 
confinement. When the misdemeanor was serious, the delinquent 
was taken to the guard, where they tied him to a pipe or a post 
and gave him twenty-five or more lashes, depending on his crime. 
Sometimes they put them in the head-stocks; other times they 
passed a musket from one leg to the other and fastened it there, 
and also they tied their hands. That punishment, called “the Law 
of Bayone,” was very painful. But Fathers Sanchez and Zalvidea 
were always very considerate with the Indians. I would not want 
to say what others did because they did not live in the mission.

Manifest Destiny. Th e political parties that had emerged from the John Adams-Th omas 
Jeff erson presidential election—the Federalists and the Democratic-Republicans—were 
long gone. America’s founding generation, including all presidents up to John Quincy 
Adams, disliked “party spirit,” even if they accepted that spirit when it helped them. 
Martin Van Buren, who had built on the base of the older Democratic-Republican organizations 
to create the new Democratic Party that elected Jackson and who followed him 
as its candidate, had no such reservations. He thought it best “to deal with the subject of 
Political Parties in a sincerer and wiser spirit—to recognize their necessity [and] to give 
them the credit they deserve.” 
As part of their eff ort to build a strong political party, Jackson and Van Buren called 
the fi rst national political convention to be held by a major party. Th e event was held 
in Baltimore in 1835, a year before the presidential election. (Th e small Anti-Masonic 
Party actually held the first national political convention, modeled on a religious 
revival in 1831, but it won only seven electoral votes in the 1832 election and faded 
from national prominence thereaft er.) Th e Democrats borrowed the idea of a national 
convention as part of their preparation for the 1836 election, and their tight political 
organization allowed the Democrats to win most presidential contests until the 
Civil War when the party splintered. At the 1835 convention, Jackson stage-managed 
Van Buren’s nomination as the Democratic party’s candidate for what some said was 
basically a third term for Jackson. Th e outgoing president also managed to ensure the 
nomination of his hand-picked candidate for vice president, Richard Mentor Johnson 
of Kentucky, in spite of an eff ort by Virginia’s delegates to derail his nomination. 
Th e core principle of the emerging Whig Party was opposition to Jackson, though 
it also wanted a larger federal government that could manage internal improvements. 
Th e Whigs continued to support a Bank of the United States. But the Whigs disliked 
Van Buren’s ideas of political parties and continued to distrust the growing sense of 
party spirit, or at least said that they did. Given this distrust, the Whigs were not well 
enough organized to have a national convention in preparation for the 1836 election 
relying instead on state conventions. Th ey reasoned that, even if the various states did 
not nominate the same candidate for president, they might use a number of popular 
candidates to gain enough electoral votes to throw the election into the House of 
Representatives where they were confi dent they could control the outcome. Having 
lost decisively with Henry Clay in 1832, most Whig leaders wanted a diff erent candidate. 
One choice, popular in the North and West, was William Henry Harrison, 
who had won as many battles as Jackson during the War of 1812. Some states duly 
nominated Harrison, and Clay reluctantly supported him. Southern Whigs nominated 
Hugh Lawson White of Tennessee, who agreed with Jackson on many issues but had 
broken with him over what he saw as Jackson’s abuse of power. Whigs in Massachusetts 
went their own way with Senator Daniel Webster. Th e Whig eff ort to appeal to diverse 
constituencies with diff erent candidates failed. In November 1836, the Jackson magic 
stuck to Van Buren and he received 50.79 percent of the popular vote and 170 electoral 
votes against 124 votes scattered among the three Whig candidates. 
Van Buren faced several challenges as he began to govern. He pledged to continue 
Jackson’s policies and did so, in particular, presiding over the fi nal removal of 
the Cherokees to Oklahoma and a long and bloody war against Seminoles in Florida. 
Given his difficulties with the Seminoles, Van Buren decided against removing 
Iroquois tribes from New York. He avoided a war with Britain when rebels in Canada 
recruited volunteers along the American side of the Great Lakes. In spite of his ties 
to the party of Manifest Destiny, he had no inclination to deal with Texas or Oregon. 
In addition, issues of nullifi cation and abolitionism continued, unresolved. Like 
Jackson, Van Buren opposed nullifi cation or any eff ort to disrupt the Union. He also 
opposed abolitionism, which, despite his northern roots, he saw as another attack on 
the Union along with nullifi cation. Southerners supported Van Buren, and he repaid 
them by supporting a gag rule in Congress. The Constitution gave all citizens the 
gag rule 
A procedural rule passed in the House of 
Representatives that prevented discussion of 
antislavery petitions from 1836 to 1844. 

Chapter 11 Manifest Destiny: Expanding the Nation 329

11.3 
right to “petition the government for a redress of grievances,” and abolitionists had 
begun fl ooding the House and Senate with antislavery petitions. Th e gag rule was a 
promise by congressional leaders in the House of Representatives to ignore the abolitionist 
petitions. In the end, the gag rule only highlighted the divisions over slavery. 
As a member of the House, John Quincy Adams took it upon himself to undermine 
the rule in every possible way. He saw it as a limitation on the constitutional rights 
of abolitionists, and they came to view him as “Old Man Eloquent.” Through the 
1830s and 1840s, Adams and a handful of like-minded Whigs began to introduce 
antislavery petitions at each session of Congress before the House adopted its rules, 
including the gag rule. Th en, during sessions, he regularly interrupted other debates 
to ask the Speaker whether this or that petition ran afoul of the gag rule while knowing 
full well that it did but using the occasion to describe both the petition and the 
gag rule. Perhaps more eff ectively than if there had been no rule, Adams used these 
manipulations of the gag rule to change public opinion on slavery, even if he could 
not get the votes he wanted from the House. 
Most challenging for Van Buren’s political fortunes, however, was the fact that 
some of the economic policies Jackson had advocated had their greatest impact during 
Van Buren’s term and it was not a good one. Only 2 months aft er Van Buren’s 
inauguration, the Panic of 1837 hit the country. Th e initial cause of the panic was 
a sudden drying up of credit. Without the ability to borrow money, cotton brokers 
failed, banks failed, and the great New York mercantile house of Arthur Tappan and 
Company failed. In his hatred of banks and distrust of debt, Jackson had paid off 
the national debt—sending a great deal of U.S. currency to bond holders in Britain 
and reducing the currency available in the United States. Jackson also had closed the 
Second Bank of the United States, which had held the ability to expand credit when 
it was needed. In addition, he had issued a Specie Circular in 1836, requiring speculators 
to pay for federal land in silver or gold coinage, not bank notes. The Specie 
Circular refl ected Jackson’s distrust of banks, but once the economy began to decline 
in 1837, many Americans started to think that if the U.S. government would not trust 
bank notes, then they should not either. Th ere was a run on banks, and few banks had 
suffi cient reserves of silver and gold to redeem all of the bank notes they had issued. 
Banks failed, and credit became even scarcer, crippling the economy. 
Panic of 1837 
A major economic downturn brought on by 
temporary excesses in international trade 
and the inability of the United States to 
control the currency or make credit available 
after the closing of the Second Bank of the 
United States. 
Specie Circular 
A proclamation issued by President Andrew 
Jackson in 1836 stipulating that only gold or 
silver could be used as payment for public 
land. 
Soon after Jackson left offi ce, the Panic of 1837, which many blamed on him, wracked the nation. In this 
political cartoon, the results of Jackson’s economic policies are shown as drunkenness, women begging a 
rich banker for money, and long lines of the unemployed.

A second panic hit in 1839, this one the result of overspeculation in cotton and 
cotton-producing land. When British investments and international trade stalled, the 
value of cotton, land, and slaves all plummeted. Th e sale of public lands, and federal 
revenue from these sales, virtually stopped. Northern textile and shoe industries laid 
off thousands of workers. More banks closed. Th e panic lasted until 1843 and was arguably 
as severe as any economic downturn before the Great Depression of the 1930s. 
Given his Jacksonian commitment to small government, there was little that Van 
Buren could or would do about the economy. His position enabled the Whigs in the 
1840 election to describe him as “cold and heartless.” Th e Whigs had also learned 
from the Democrats. In 1840, they held a single national convention that unifi ed them 
behind one candidate. For a second time, they pinned their hopes on the aging war 
hero William Henry Harrison, despite Clay’s eff ort to secure the nomination for himself. 
Th ey nominated John Tyler of Virginia, who had served as governor and senator, 
for vice president, an ill-fated choice. Tyler brought balance to the ticket—he was from 
the South while Harrison was from the North, and at age 50, he was much younger 
than the 68-year-old Harrison. But Tyler was a Whig only because he found Jackson 
“high handed,” not because he disagreed with most of his policies. Th e 1840 political 
campaign pitted Martin Van Buren, running for a second term, against “Tippecanoe 
and Tyler Too ,” a reference to Harrison’s victory at the Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811. 
Th is time, the Whigs won with 52.8 percent of the popular votes and 234 electoral 
votes against only 60 for Van Buren. But the high expectations for the Whig presidency 
would not last long. 
At his inauguration in March 1841, Harrison delivered a long address laying out 
the Whig agenda; in fact, it was the longest inaugural address in American presidential 
history. Th e day was cold and blustery, and Harrison did not wear a coat. He caught a 
bad cold that turned to pneumonia. A month later, President Harrison was dead and 
Tyler was president. Th is instance marked the fi rst time a president had died in offi ce, 
and Tyler made it clear that he was not just an “acting president” but that he had inherited 
the presidency for the full term. A worse disaster for the Whig Party was hard 
to imagine. Th e election of 1840 was the only time when the country elected a Whig 
president and Whig majorities in both houses of Congress. Aft er only a month into 
the new administration, “Tyler Too,” who shared little of the Whig agenda beyond an 
intense dislike of Andrew Jackson and an interest in holding offi ce, was president. 
Before he became seriously ill, President Harrison had called a special session of 
Congress to deal with the economic crisis. When the Whig-dominated Congress convened, 
it re-created the Bank of the United States so that there could be federal control 
of the currency and credit, thus easing economic conditions that had been created 
when the bank had been abolished. President Tyler, a believer in small government 
every bit as much as Jackson or Van Buren, vetoed the bill. Congress then created 
a “fi scal corporation” that would have more limited powers. Tyler vetoed that, too. 
Tyler did sign the Land Act of 1841, which made it much easier for homesteaders to 
buy federal land or keep land on which they were squatters, and he signed the fi rst 
federal Bankruptcy Act. But the Whigs were furious at Tyler. In September 1841, the 
entire cabinet except for Secretary of State Daniel Webster resigned in protest over 
the veto of the bank bills, and the Whig congressional caucus expelled Tyler from the 
party, marking the only time in U.S. history that a president was expelled from his 
own political party. 
Expanding the size of the United States remained an issue throughout the Tyler 
presidency. Webster had refused to resign as secretary of state primarily because he 
was negotiating with Britain to resolve a dispute that came dangerously close to war 
over where to locate the border between Maine and Canada. Th e Webster-Ashburton 
Treaty of 1842 resolved the border with Canada as far west as Minnesota. Tyler 
supported Webster because he did not want problems with Britain when he turned to 
his real priority—Texas. 
Webster-Ashburton Treaty 
The treaty signed by the United States and 
Britain in 1842 that settled a boundary dispute 
between the United States and Canada and 
provided for closer cooperation in suppressing 
the African slave trade.

11.3 
Tyler had two paramount goals—the annexation of Texas and his own reelection. 
He failed at the latter but not the former. In September 1843, Tyler began secret 
negotiations with Texas over annexation. In April 1844, Tyler’s new Secretary of State 
John C. Calhoun, who was also a Whig only because of his hatred for Jackson over 
the nullifi cation issue, presented a treaty to the Senate for the annexation of Texas. 
Calhoun justifi ed the treaty in explicitly proslavery terms, insisting that if the United 
States did not annex Texas as a slave state, Britain would take it over and end slavery 
there, blocking the expansion of U.S. slavery. But the nation’s leading Whig, Henry 
Clay, and former Democratic President Martin Van Buren both announced their 
opposition to annexation largely because of slavery. Th e Senate rejected the treaty by 
an overwhelming vote of 35 to 16. 
Th e link between Texas and slavery doomed the presidential hopes of both Tyler and 
Calhoun since both were seen as using a political gimmick to gain their way. Th e Whigs 
nominated their old hero Henry Clay. Having been expelled by the Whigs, Tyler tried 
for the Democratic nomination, but the party spurned him. Jackson still dominated the 
Democratic Party. He would not allow Tyler to be their candidate, and Jackson was furious 
at Van Buren over Van Buren’s opposition to the annexation of Texas. As a result, 
the Democrats ended up nominating Jackson’s choice, a political unknown, James K. 
Polk of Tennessee, instead of their own former president Martin Van Buren. 
James K. Polk was a true “dark horse” in American presidential politics. He had 
served as speaker of the house from 1835 to 1839 but had twice been defeated for 
governor of Tennessee. Few besides Jackson thought he would be president. His Whig 
opponent, Henry Clay, was one of the best-known political leaders in the United States. 
If Van Buren had been the Democratic nominee, the election would have been fought 
over Clay’s support for federally fi nanced internal improvements and his advocacy for 
the Bank of the United States, both of which Van Buren opposed. Polk’s nomination 
changed everything. Th e Democratic Party platform called for “the reoccupation of 
Oregon and the reannexation of Texas.” With Polk as their nominee, the Democrats 
planned to focus the election on Manifest Destiny, claiming that they were the party of 
national expansion while painting the Whigs as timid defenders of the status quo. Th is 
focus on Manifest Destiny, especially as it applied to Texas, assured Polk the support 
not only of Jackson but also of President Tyler and of Calhoun’s pro-slavery partners 
who included both Whigs and Democrats in the South. Many Catholics also saw the 
Whigs as a Protestant party, while the Democrats courted Catholic voters, especially 
recent immigrants. Most of the country’s Catholics voted Democratic, especially in 
Pennsylvania and New York. In the end, Polk won 170 electoral votes to 105 for Clay. 
Expansion in Oregon and Texas was going to be at the top of Polk’s agenda. 
Because the new president would not take offi ce until March 4 (the practice from 
the country’s beginning until passage of the Twentieth Amendment in 1933), Tyler still 
had 4 months to serve in offi ce. He did not waste them. When the Senate had rejected 
the annexation of Texas in 1844, it had rejected a treaty with the Republic of Texas. 
But the Constitution provided that while treaties had to be ratifi ed by two-thirds of the 
Senate, a new state could be admitted by a majority vote in each house of Congress. 
Up to this point, all new states had been U.S. territories, not separate sovereign countries. 
Th ere was no precedent for incorporating another country into the United States. 
Now Tyler, with Jackson’s advice and Polk’s support, tried a new approach: simply 
admit Texas as a state. Th e idea worked. Instead of a treaty with Texas, which required 
a two-thirds vote in the Senate that Tyler could not get, both houses of Congress passed 
a resolution admitting Texas as a state in February 1845, leaving it to the president to 
negotiate the Texas border with Mexico (see Map 11-2 ). Five senators, led by Missouri’s 
Th omas Hart Benton, who had opposed annexation, now supported the statehood resolution 
based on a promise that President Polk would conduct the negotiations about 
the Texas border. Tyler did not feel bound by the promise. On March 1, 1845, with 
4 days left in offi ce, Tyler signed the resolution admitting Texas, sent envoys to Texas

off ering immediate statehood without any negotiations, and held a gala White House 
party to celebrate the admission of the new state to the union. Benton was furious, and 
most Whigs were equally distraught. Th ree days later on March 4, 1845, James K. Polk 
was inaugurated as president of a nation that considered Texas to be one of its states, 
even if Mexico did not agree. 
54° 40ʹ or Fight—The United States and Oregon 
Until the mid-1830s, few Americans had followed the route of the Lewis and Clark expedition 
and explored or settled in Oregon. Th e Canadian Hudson’s Bay Company dominated 
the fur business in Oregon, and Indian tribes traded furs to the company for rifl es 
and other goods. While American political debates seemed fi xated on Texas, Oregon was 
generally ignored by the press or in Congress. Th e lack of interest in Oregon began to 
change in July 1836 when some 70 people traveled through a pass in the Rocky Mountains 
into what is now Wyoming. Some of the group, including four Protestant missionaries, 
settled in the fertile farming areas of the Willamette Valley south of the Columbia River 
in present-day Oregon. Two of those missionaries, Marcus and Narcissa Whitman, also 
became fi rst-rate publicists for beauties of the Oregon Territory (see Map 11-3 ).

Narcissa Whitman and her physician husband Marcus were 
sent by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign 
Missions to establish a mission to the Cayuse Indians near 
what is now Walla Walla, Washington, in 1836. The mission 
converted few Cayuse. But Narcissa’s letters home and her 
husband’s speaking tours encouraged white settlement in the 
Oregon territory, settlement that alienated Indians but led to 
a strong American presence in the area. Although the letters 
were filled with descriptions of the hardships of the journey 
across the Rocky Mountains and the difficulty of life in Oregon, 
Narcissa’s praise of the beauty and fertility of the land made the 
greatest impact. 
September 12. [1836] What a delightful place this is; what 
a contrast to the rough, barren sand plains, through which we 
had so recently passed. Here we find fruit of every description, 
apples, peaches, grapes, pears, plums, and fig trees in abundance; 
also cucumbers, melons, beans, peas, beets, cabbage, 
tomatoes and every kind of vegetable too numerous to be mentioned. 
Every part is very neat and tastefully arranged, with fine 
walks, lined on each side with strawberry vines. At the opposite 
end of the garden is a good summer house covered with 
grape vines. 
Dec. 26th. [1836] It is indeed, a lovely situation. We are on 
a beautiful level—a peninsula formed by the branches of the 
Walla Walla river, upon the base of which our house stands, 
on the southeast corner, near the shore of the main river. To 
run a fence across to the opposite river, on the north from our 
house—this, with the river, would enclose 300 acres of good 
land for cultivation, all directly under the eye. The rivers are 
barely skirted with timber. This is all the woodland we can see; 
beyond them, as far as the eye can reach, plains and mountains 
appear. On the east, a few rods from the house, is a range 
of small hills, covered with bunchgrass—a very excellent food 
for animals, and upon which they subsist during winter, even 
digging it from under the snow. 
Waiilatpu, Oregon Territory [The Whitman Mission 
near Walla Walla] 
August 23. [1847] For the last two weeks immigrants have been 
passing, probably 80 or 100 wagons have already passed and 
1,000 are said to be on the road, besides the Mormons…The poor 
Indians are amazed at the overwhelming numbers of Americans 
coming into the country. They seem not to know what to make of 
it. Very many of the principal ones are dying, and...[t]he remaining 
ones seem attached to us, and cling to us the closer; cultivate 
their farms quite extensively, and do not wish to see any Sniapus 
(Americans) settle among them here. 
The Cayuse Indians, who were the focus of the Whitman 
Mission, were indeed “amazed at the overwhelming numbers 
of Americans coming into the country.” When, as a result of the 
immigration, a measles epidemic struck in 1847, the amazement 
turned to anger. The Whitmans provided medical care to Indian 
and white children, but many Cayuse still died. In November 
1847, the Cayuse Chief Tiloukaikt led a party that killed both 
Whitmans and burned the mission. In response, a white militia 
attacked the Cayuse. Two years later, Tiloukaikt was executed for 
the murder of the Whitmans. From the gallows he said, “Did not 
your missionaries teach us that Christ died to save his people? 
So we die to save our people.” Disease and white raids so weakened 
the Cayuse that they could not continue as an independent 
nation, and they merged into the Nez Perce and Yakima tribes.

The Letters of Narcissa Whitman, 1836–1847 
The Whitmans’ letters about Oregon did much to attract further American 
settlement, but the claim to the Oregon Territory had been shared by the United 
States and Britain since a series of treaties negotiated by then Secretary of State John 
Quincy Adams between 1818 and 1824 created the joint American-British governance 
of Oregon (see Chapter 8 ) . Th e Oregon Territory stretched along the Pacifi c coast 
from the northern border of Spanish-Mexican California to the southern border of 
what was then Russian America, (now Alaska) and included the present U.S. states of 
Oregon, Washington, and Idaho as well as the Canadian province of British Columbia 
and the Yukon Territory. By the 1840s, both governments wanted to resolve the border 
and end the joint ownership of the territory. 
In the Webster-Ashburton Treaty of 1842, the United States and Britain had already 
negotiated a U.S.-Canadian border at the 49th parallel from the Great Lakes west to the 
beginning of Oregon. Continuing that border west would split the Oregon Territory

between the two countries. Tyler’s ambassador in London proposed making the 49th 
parallel the boundary all the way to the Pacifi c but giving the British the southern tip 
of Vancouver Island, sliced by the 49th parallel, and giving both countries the right to 
navigate the Juan de Fuca Strait between Vancouver and the mainland. It seemed like a 
straightforward compromise. Polk, however, wanted more, or pretended to. 
In his 1844 campaign, Polk promised to win all of Oregon up to the Alaskan 
border, or 54°40ʹ in terms of latitude. But Polk needed his army for the war that he 
expected to have with Mexico and did not want to fi ght Britain, too. Th e coalition 
that elected him was divided about Oregon. Calhoun and the southern planters would 
have happily given all of Oregon to Britain. They did not want a war or even tension 
to interrupt the cotton trade with Britain that was making the South wealthy. 
In addition, from Calhoun’s perspective, any future states carved out of the Oregon 
Territory would most likely be free states, tipping the balance in the Senate against 
southern interests. But Missouri’s powerful Senator Th omas Hart Benton was growing 
fond of Oregon because the trail from Independence, Missouri, to Oregon was 
adding wealth to his state. Polk had promised 54°40ʹ, and Benton meant to hold him 
to it. John Quincy Adams, now a power in the House of Representatives, agreed with 
Benton. Although he was opposed to annexing Texas because of slavery, Adams was 
still an American expansionist, he liked the region for all the reasons Calhoun disliked 
it, and he wanted Oregon in the Union. 
The British government, led by Prime Minister Sir Robert Peel, also wanted 
a compromise that would support the Hudson’s Bay Company but guarantee an 
uninterrupted fl ow of American cotton to British mills and avoid war with the United 
States. Peel also faced other issues that were more pressing than Oregon. But others 
in London wanted more of Oregon and insisted that the southern border of British 
Oregon should be the Columbia River, which created the so-called “disputed triangle” 
of land that both nations claimed.

Th e Peel and Polk administrations eventually compromised along the 49th parallel 
(the current border) in spring 1846. Th e agreement was an obvious compromise, particularly 
for the United States, but it meant that the United States was free to pursue 
actions that Polk considered more important. As the Democratic New York Herald 
said, “We can now thrash Mexico into decency at our leisure.” 
11.1 
Quick Review Why was annexing Texas more controversial than dividing the Oregon 
Territory? Discuss at least two major factors. 
THE U.S. WAR WITH MEXICO, 1846–1848 
Analyze the causes, strategies, and outcomes of the U.S. War with Mexico. 
Two years before Presidents Tyler and Polk had managed the U.S. annexation of Texas, 
Mexico had warned the United States that such a move would mean war because 
Mexico still claimed the territory. One week aft er Tyler signed the annexation legislation, 
the Mexican ambassador in Washington declared the move “an act of aggression,” 
and Mexico severed diplomatic relations with the United States. 
Although the vote to make Texas a state of the United States was passed and celebrated 
in Washington in March of 1845, Texas did not ratify the agreement until 
July 1845, and Congress did not ratify the Texas decision until December. Meanwhile, 
Mexican President José Joaquín Herrera, a political moderate, agreed to negotiate 
with the United States. He knew his country did not have the resources to fi ght a war, 
but he also knew that public opinion in his country would never accept the loss of 
Texas, particularly the larger area of Texas going all the way to the Rio Grande that the 
United States now claimed. Polk sent former Louisiana Congressman John Slidell to 
Mexico City to negotiate. 
Fighting the War in Texas and Mexico, Responding to Resistance 
Although there were tensions between Americans and the government of Mexico from 
Texas to California, the heart of the concerns in 1846 had to do with Texas. While 
leaders in both countries negotiated about whether the United States could annex 
Texas, another question loomed: just what constituted Texas? Th e Republic of Texas 
had never governed any land west of the Nueces River. Many in the United States 
and Mexico considered that river to be the western boundary of Texas. But Polk and 
many Texans claimed that the Rio Grande was the border, a claim that made Texas a 
much bigger state (see Map 11-2 ). Herrera would never accept that claim. Moreover, 
Polk really wanted not only Texas as far as the Rio Grande but also New Mexico and 
California. He would purchase it if he could, but he also considered a war as a viable 
way to secure that land. 
While the negotiations continued, Polk ordered General Zachary Taylor to cross 
the Louisiana-Texas border at the Sabine River in June 1845 and from there continue to 
“approach as near the boundary line, the Rio Grande, as prudence will dictate.” Taylor 
was indeed a prudent general, and he initially moved only as far as the Nueces where he 
halted at Corpus Christi to train his 4,000 troops. But his orders were clear: any Mexican 
movement across the Rio Grande would be considered an act of war. It took almost a 
year for Polk to get his war, but in April 1846, Taylor’s army moved to the northern edge 
of the Rio Grande. On April 25, 1846, 11 Americans were killed in a battle with Mexican 
troops who had crossed the Rio Grande. Polk was delighted when Taylor reported that 
“hostilities may now be considered as commenced.” In his war message to Congress on 
May 11, 1846, Polk said, “Mexico…has invaded our territory and shed American blood 
upon the American soil.…War exists…by the act of Mexico herself.”

Not everyone in Congress agreed. Most Whigs opposed war, 
though they wanted to support the American troops who might be 
in harm’s way and worried about being seen as unpatriotic. Kentucky 
Whig Garrett David said, “It is our own President who began this 
war. He has been carrying it on for months.” Th e key vote on the war 
passed the House 123 to 67, though many Democrats did not want 
to be seen as opposing their party’s president and a subsequent vote 
formalizing the declaration of war carried the House by 174 to 14 with 
35 abstentions. In the Senate, the key test of strength carried only by 
26 to 20, but a subsequent vote that included funds fi nancing the war 
carried 40 to 2 with 3 abstentions. President Polk declared that a state 
of war existed between the United States and Mexico on May 13, 1846. 
Th e war that a divided Congress declared was fought by a divided 
nation. Polk and his supporters expected a quick victory. Senator 
Thomas Hart Benton wrote that the president wanted “a small war, 
just large enough to require a treaty of peace, and not large enough to 
make military reputations, dangerous for the presidency.” Polk got a 
longer and more costly war than he bargained for—one that also produced 
more military heroes. 
Th e war provoked strong opposition. A decade before it began, John 
Quincy Adams warned Congress that the annexation of Texas would 
bring on a war in which the United States would be in the wrong, saying: 
“Sirs, the banners of freedom will be the banners of Mexico; and your banners, 
I blush to speak the word, will be the banners of slavery.” A decade 
later, Adams voted against the war in the House of Representatives. 
Once the war began, others, including Congressman Abraham Lincoln 
of Illinois, joined Adams in opposition. An aspiring Whig politician from 
Illinois, Lincoln voiced his suspicions about the war. He thought that 
President Polk “is deeply conscious of being in the wrong…that he ordered General Taylor 
into the midst of a peaceful Mexican settlement, purposely to bring on a war.” Some of those 
in the fi eld agreed. In Texas, a young Lieutenant Colonel Ethan Hitchcock noted in his diary 
that “It looks as if the government sent a small force on purpose to bring on a war, so as to 
have a pretext fort taking California and as much of this country as it chooses.” 
Perhaps the most influential response to the war with Mexico came from a poet 
rather than a politician. While he is remembered today mostly for his refl ective stay 
at Walden Pond, Henry David Thoreau also believed that the war with Mexico was 
immoral. In a pamphlet titled Civil Disobedience , Th oreau wrote, “I meet this American 
government, or its representative the State government, directly, and face to face, once 
a year, no more, in the person of its tax-gatherer.” Th oreau saw the demand for his tax 
money as the opportunity to resist what he saw as the government’s injustice and refused 
to pay his tax, a portion of which would go to support what he considered to be an 
unjust and immoral war. He was arrested and spent a night in the town jail in Concord 
before someone, to his frustration, paid the tax for him. But his willingness to face arrest 
for his convictions and the pamphlet that he wrote explaining his actions made Th oreau 
not only one of the most famous opponents of the War with Mexico but a model of civil 
disobedience for generations to come, in the United States and elsewhere. 
In the fi rst battles of the war, Taylor defeated a larger Mexican force and occupied 
the Mexican town of Matamoros in May 1846. Th e Mexican army fought bravely, but 
the Americans had superior technology—rifl es that shot farther and better artillery. 
Th e U.S. Navy blockaded Mexican ports on the Gulf and Pacifi c coasts, so Mexico 
could not import supplies from abroad. Taylor’s army moved slowly into Mexico, but 
heat and disease took a heavier toll than battles. One in eight U.S. soldiers died in a 
6-week encampment in the Mexican city of Camargo even though no battles took place 
there. If the troops, especially the volunteers, had learned to fi ll canteens upstream 
from where horses were washed, the death toll would have been far lower. Th en in

Chapter 11 Manifest Destiny: Expanding the Nation 337 
H 11.3 enry David Thoreau (1817–1862) published “On the Duty 
of Civil Disobedience” in 1849. The essay has at least two 
themes: Thoreau’s opposition to most, if not all, government 
and his belief that civil disobedience—in this case breaking an 
immoral law—was the right thing to do. Thoreau’s belief in civil 
disobedience—refusing to obey an unjust law and a willingness to 
face the consequences—have made Thoreau a model for others 
who advocated civil disobedience, including Martin Luther King, 
Jr. (1929–1968) in the United States and Mohandas Gandhi (1869– 
1948), who led the nonviolent protests that eventually won India 
independence from Great Britain, both of whom cited Thoreau. 
But Thoreau’s arguments are complex and many who may 
agree with some of what he might say would reject other 
aspects of his essay. In the essay he begins by arguing: 
I heartily accept the motto, “That government is best 
which governs least”; and I should like to see it acted up 
to more rapidly and systematically. Carried out, it finally 
amounts to this, which also I believe—“That government 
is best which governs not at all”; and when men 
are prepared for it, that will be the kind of government 
which they will have. Government is at best but an expedient; 
but most governments are usually, and all governments 
are sometimes, inexpedient. The objections 
which have been brought against a standing army, and 
they are many and weighty, and deserve to prevail, may 
also at last be brought against a standing government. 
He then moves on to his specific critique of the war with Mexico 
and his appeal for resistance: 
How does it become a man to behave toward the 
American government today? I answer, that he cannot 
without disgrace be associated with it. I cannot for an 
instant recognize that political organization as my government 
which is the slave’s government also.…Under 
a government which imprisons unjustly, the true place 
for a just man is also a prison. The proper place today, 
the only place which Massachusetts has provided for her 
freer and less despondent spirits, is in her prisons, to be 
put out and locked out of the State by her own act, as 
they have already put themselves out by their principles. 
It is there that the fugitive slave, and the Mexican prisoner 
on parole, and the Indian come to plead the wrongs 
of his race should find them; on that separate but more 
free and honorable ground, where the State places those 
who are not with her, but against her—the only house in 
a slave State in which a free man can abide with honor. 
Finally, he says he is not willing to be like “the thousands who are 
in opinion opposed to slavery and to the war, who yet in effect 
do nothing.” Thoreau refused to pay taxes to support the war 
and was jailed for his crime of conscience. 
While Thoreau’s words and actions were widely praised by 
some and condemned by others, the arguments also involved 
significant internal differences: 
• Some who agreed with Thoreau in his opposition to the war 
were not willing to risk jail as he was and did not think it was 
necessary to do so or indeed proper to break the law as he did. 
• Some who agreed with Thoreau in his opposition to the war 
also disagreed with his critique of all government and would 
never echo Thoreau’s words, “The objections which have been 
brought against a standing army, and they are many and 
weighty, and deserve to prevail, may also at last be brought 
against a standing government.” Indeed, many have criticized 
Thoreau for being a philosopher of excessive individualism— 
advocating the moral worth of the individual over the state or 
a social group—a stance that observers from Tocqueville to 
the present have criticized the United States for representing.

Mifflin, 1893). 
Thinking Critically 
1. Contextualization 
How would you explain Thoreau’s decision to use a fugitive 
slave, a Mexican prisoner, and an Indian as examples of those 
wronged by his government? What connections might he 
make between the plight of all three? What was happening 
in the United States that might lead an author to link these 
different groups of people in 1849? 
2. Chronological Reasoning 
What are the implications of his rejection of all government 
when he says, “That government is best which governs not 
at all.” Is it necessary to agree with Thoreau in his rejection of 
government to agree with his critique of the War with Mexico 
or his decision to go to jail as a matter of conscience rather 
than pay taxes to support the war? 
THINKING HISTORICALLY 
Considering Henry David Thoreau 
September 1846, Taylor defeated another larger Mexican force and captured the crucial 
Mexican town of Monterrey. With both armies now exhausted, Taylor allowed 
the Mexicans to withdraw peacefully and declared a truce, which infuriated Polk. 
After the victory at Monterrey, Polk tried to open peace negotiations, but the 
Mexican government was not interested. This lack of interest came as a surprise 
because the United States had secretly helped the former Mexican dictator Santa Anna

seize power in Mexico City, based on his promise to U.S. negotiators that he would 
conclude a peace treaty. But once in offi ce, Santa Anna shift ed his position and prepared 
to fi ght rather than bargain (see Map 11-4 ). 
Santa Anna marched north to engage Taylor, whom he knew was now short of troops. 
In February 1847, the two armies met at what Americans called the Battle of Buena Vista. 
It was the largest single engagement of the war, and it was a draw, which meant that Santa 
Anna had failed to defeat the Americans on Mexican soil. Taylor’s army remained intact. 
Many of Taylor’s best troops had been moved further south. As Polk realized he 
was in for a long fi ght, he also knew that Taylor could not march across the deserts to 
Mexico City. Th e distance was too long to supply an invading army. Polk also worried

WHAT DID THE TEXAS 
REVOLUTION AND 
MEXICAN-AMERICAN WAR 
MEAN FOR AMERICAN 
EXPANSION? 
In the 1830s, the Mexican government 
faced problems in its northern state 
of Texas. The area was home to many 
Anglo-American settlers, and they were 
growing increasingly unhappy under 
Mexican governance. Texans successfully 
rebelled, forming the independent 
Republic of Texas in 1836. During the 
next decade, the United States annexed 
Texas as a new state, but disputed 
land claims quickly led to war between 
the United States and Mexico in 1846. 
The U.S. victory over the Mexican forces 
in 1848, after a series of consecutive U.S. 
battle successes, led to huge territorial 
losses for its southern neighbor as the 
United States acquired the territory that 
today is the modern Southwest.

about making Taylor a war hero and political rival. So he turned to the experienced 
professional soldier Winfield Scott to plan an invasion of the Mexican heartland. 
In March 1847, aft er careful planning, Scott landed troops at the port of Veracruz. 
(It was the largest amphibious operation of U.S. troops before D-Day during World 
War II.) Scott’s army then marched to Mexico City, taking the same invasion route 
that Hernán Cortés had used against the Aztecs 328 years before (see Chapter 2 ). Aft er 
hard fi ghting, Mexico City surrendered in September 1847. Polk, still worried about 
military heroes, then removed Scott from command in early 1848. Th e United States 
had lost 12,518 soldiers and spent almost $100 million in the war. Mexico had lost 
many more lives—soldiers and civilians—and its economy was devastated. 
From New Mexico to Alta California and the Bear Flag Revolt 
While the major focus of the fi ghting in the U.S. war with Mexico took place on the Texas 
border and in the heartland of Mexico, New Mexico and California were not exempt 
from battles, though they were of smaller scale than anything seen elsewhere. Th e initial 
U.S. conquest of New Mexico was easy. In the summer of 1846, General Stephen Watts 
Kearny marched 850 miles from Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, to Santa Fe. Th e Mexican 
governor had already fl ed, and Kearny took silence and sullenness among the people 
for support or at least acceptance of the American takeover. He raised the U.S. fl ag in 
Santa Fe and promised that the government would respect the residents’ property and 
religious freedom as well as protect them from Indian raids. Kearny appointed Charles 
Bent, an American already living in Taos, as territorial governor. Th en in September 
1846, a month aft er he had arrived, Kearny marched most of his troops off to secure the 
U.S. victory in California. Although a bloody rebellion against U.S. rule by Hispanics 
and Indians broke out later that year, and Bent himself was killed by the rebels, U.S. 
troops soon suppressed it, and most armed resistance to annexation ended. 
Emboldened by this show of support, a group of armed American immigrants in 
the inland town of Sonoma arrested General Mariano Vallejo, the man they considered 
the symbol of Mexican authority in Sonoma, and jailed him at Fort Sutter near 
Sacramento. Vallejo had retired from active duty with the Mexican government and 
was quite friendly to a possible American takeover. But to the Americans, Vallejo 
symbolized Mexican authority. With no other Mexican leader in sight, the rebels organized 
what they called the Bear Flag Revolt by declaring California to be an independent 
Republic. Th ey also designed a fl ag and raised it in the town square in Sonoma. 
Th e fl ag displayed a large star next to a grizzly bear atop a bottom border stripe and 
the words “California Republic.” To the Mexicans like Vallejo, the Bear Flag was a 
symbol that these new immigrants were the bears who came as a thief to take their 
cattle and their land. Soon aft er Vallejo’s arrest, Sloat’s U.S. Navy squadron sailed into 
Monterey Bay and proclaimed U.S. conquest of California as a victory in the War with 
Mexico. Th e independent California Republic was a short-lived convenience. Th e rebels 
replaced the Bear Flag (now the state fl ag of California) with the Stars and Stripes. 
Th e American conquest of California was much easier than the war along the Rio 
Grande in Texas. The Mexican government was much less interested in California 
than in Texas, a reality that had allowed a unique Californian culture to develop in the 
early decades of the 19th century. Mexican citizens of California, the products of this 
culture, had a decidedly ambivalent attitude toward annexation by the United States. 
Nevertheless, some native Californians opposed the American takeover and fought 
against the Bear Flag rebels and the American forces led by Navy Commodore Robert 
Stockton, who had replaced Sloat, and Captain Frémont. Th ose Californians saw themselves 
as citizens of the Republic of Mexico, even if sometimes disgruntled citizens, 
and they saw the Americans as an invading army. In a series of skirmishes between 
1846 and 1847, 35 of those fi ghting on the American side died in battle while an estimated 
eight Californios (those fi ghting for the Mexican cause) were killed. Later, the 
Californios suff ered much greater losses in property and, indeed, their way of life. 
Bear Flag Revolt 
A revolt led by recent American immigrants 
who temporarily declared California to be an 
independent Republic until U.S. forces took 
control of the territory.

Th ere were many reasons for the limited nature of the warfare in California. Th e 
total non-Indian population of California was very small, and most of the regular 
Mexican forces had abandoned the region before hostilities began. Probably even 
more signifi cant, most of the Mexican leaders in California were really hoping for 
an American takeover to replace the distant and inept Mexican administration and 
the lawlessness of the American Bear Flag frontiersmen. In 1847, the fi nal skirmishes 
between Californio defenders under Andrés Pico and the American troops took 
place in southern California. As it became increasingly clear that no support could be 
expected from Mexico, Pico negotiated the terms of what he saw as an honorable surrender. 
In January 1847, Pico’s troops marched into Los Angeles and disbanded. Th e 
American control of the region was complete. 
Negotiating the Peace, Defi ning the Borders 
In April 1847, Polk had sent Nicholas Trist, an experienced diplomat, to accompany 
Scott and negotiate a treaty with the Mexican government. Aft er the fi ghting in Mexico 
City had ended, Trist began serious negotiations. With Mexico City, New Mexico, and 
California already in the hands of the U.S. Army, however, Polk decided that Trist was 
not being tough enough and recalled him. Instead of returning to Washington, Trist 
warned the Mexican authorities that he had been recalled and that his replacement would 
demand much more. Perhaps they might want to conclude a treaty quickly with him. 
Th e Mexicans were anxious to end the U.S. occupation of Mexico City and the country’s 
key ports, and Trist was right: aft er the conquest of Mexico City, Polk wanted even more 
Mexican territory. On February 2, 1848, Trist and the Mexican commissioners signed the 
Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo . Trist told his wife that he had asked Mexico for the minimum 
that Polk would accept because he was ashamed of “the iniquity of the war, as an 
abuse of power on our part.” But his minimum included all of Polk’s original demands— 
all of Texas to the Rio Grande and land further west to California as far south as San 
Diego. Mexico was paid $15 million, which went to its creditors. Th e treaty may have been 
for less land than Polk wanted, but it reshaped both the United States and Mexico. 
A furious President Polk, realizing that he was stuck with the treaty that Trist had 
negotiated, submitted it to the Senate, which ratifi ed it. But Polk refused to pay Trist 
for his services. (Trist was not paid until 1871.) Th e Whig-affi liated editor Horace 
Greeley wrote in his New York Tribune , “Let us have peace, no matter if the adjuncts 
are revolting.” Th e abolitionist Frederick Douglass was harsher: “Th ey have succeeded 
in robbing Mexico of her territory, and are rejoicing over their success under the hypocritical 
pretense of a regard for peace.” Nevertheless, with the Treaty of Guadalupe 
Hidalgo, peace had come. Th e United States was much larger as a result of the war, 
now including 90,000 new citizens who had been citizens of Mexico and even more 
Indians who preferred to stay independent of both countries. It was a diff erent country 
from when Polk took offi ce. 
In 1853, one of Polk’s successors, President Franklin Pierce, sent James Gadsden 
to Mexico City with instructions to buy a strip of land south of Arizona and New 
Mexico for a southern transcontinental railroad from New Orleans to El Paso to Los 
Angeles, which needed to be located south of the Rocky Mountains. Gadsden was also 
told to purchase as much additional land as possible, including perhaps all of Baja 
California. Mexican authorities suspected that the United States was aft er much more 
than a railroad route. In the end, Mexico sold only the minimum that the United 
States wanted. For $10 million, money its government badly needed, Mexico ceded 
39,000 sparsely populated square miles to the United States. Th is area, known as the 
Gadsden Purchase , was the fi nal extension of U.S. territory within what would be the 
contiguous 48 states (see Map 11-5 ). 
In his own eyes, Polk had an amazingly successful term. He had made the United 
States a continental nation. He had completed the job he had promised to do and did 
not seek a second term. For the election of 1848, Polk’s Democrats nominated Lewis

United States was completed in

Cass of Michigan. Th e Whigs, having won once with a general and having lost three 
times with their hero Henry Clay, turned to a new war hero and nominated General 
Zachary Taylor, known as “Old Rough and Ready,” and former Congressman Millard 
Fillmore from New York as Taylor’s running mate. While Taylor was as strong a 
nationalist as Jackson, he was also a slaveholder, and Cass, like Polk, was an expansionist. 
Northerners opposed to slavery could not stomach either of them and some 
created the Free Soil Party, which was committed to ensuring that all new territories 
would be free of slavery. Th e Free Soilers did not propose abolishing slavery where it 
already existed but did oppose any extension of slavery into any new territories. Using 
that platform, they nominated former President Van Buren as their candidate. In the 
three-way race, Taylor won a solid victory. It was an ironic outcome for President 
Polk. Th e Whigs had opposed Polk throughout his term, especially on the issue of the 
War with Mexico, and the president feared creating military heroes throughout the 
war. In the end, a Whig war hero succeeded him. A little over a year into his term, on

Quick Review Considering U.S. actions in Texas and California, was the Mexican-American 
War a “land grab”? Why or why not? 
WEST INTO THE PACIFIC 
Describe the causes and outcomes of U.S. expansion in California and into the Pacific 
region, including establishing new relationships with Hawaii, China, and Japan. 
Early in his term of offi ce, President Polk had told Congress that he was interested in 
acquiring California’s harbors from Mexico because, he said, these ports would shelter 
American ships and allow the Pacifi c Ocean to provide the basis for “an extensive and 
profi table commerce with China, and other countries of the East.” He had no idea how 
quickly his dream would come true. Even before the negotiations with Mexico were 
complete, gold was discovered in California, and the resulting Gold Rush made into 
thriving commercial centers not only the gold camps but also the cities around harbors 
that Polk wanted. Th ese same Pacifi c coast harbors quickly became home to American 
ships that had been dominating much of the Pacifi c Ocean for a decade before Polk 
spoke. In the 1840s, American whaling ships led all other nations in the whale trade in 
the Pacifi c, and the U.S. Navy led the way to American negotiations for a role in trade 
with Hawaii and China. Aft er the acquisition of California, the Navy also established 
a trading relationship with Japan. Aft er 1848, the profi ts of the Pacifi c trade poured 
into the United States through the newly acquired Pacifi c ports. Th e acquisition of 
Oregon and California not only expanded the United States to the Pacifi c coast but 
also allowed the nation to become a dominant player all across the Pacifi c Ocean. 
The Gold Rush to California 
Another 1848 development was perhaps even more important to California’s history 
than the shift in political authority from Mexico to the United States. On January 24, 
1848, while American and Mexican negotiators were still meeting in the Mexican town 
of Guadalupe Hidalgo, James Marshall, a carpenter at the fort and mill owned by Swiss 
native Johann Sutter on the American River in northern California, was deepening the 
channel going into the mill’s water wheel when he noticed some odd material in the 
water. He reported, “Boys, I believe I have found a gold mine.” His was the fi rst discovery 
of gold that would quickly lead to the California Gold Rush . 
Sutter and Marshall tried to keep the discovery a secret, but word spread all too 
quickly. By May 1848, everyone in San Francisco seemed to know that gold had been 
discovered. And while communications were still slow, prospective miners from all 
over California—Indians, long time Mexican residents, and American settlers—as 
well as immigrants from Oregon, Hawaii, Mexico, and as far away as Chile, Peru, 
Australia, France, and parts of China moved into the gold fi elds of the Sierra Nevada 
mountains. The rush was on. Two-thirds of the white men in Oregon came south 
to California. Recently discharged soldiers from the Mexican and American armies 
joined them there. In the earliest days, California Indians who knew the land best 
made excellent gold prospectors. Newcomers expressed surprise that in the fi rst year 
of the gold rush Miwok Indian women panned for gold alongside of Milwok men and 
the newcomers from around the globe. Th e diversity in the fi elds did not last. 
In August 1848, an article in the New York Herald included a brief mention that 
“gold, worth in value $30, was picked up in the bed of a stream of the Sacramento.” 
President Polk, determined to show the value of the newly acquired territory,

included a mention in his Annual Message to Congress. Ten million dollars in gold 
was produced in California in 1848, and within 3 years, the revenue had grown to 
$220 million. So much gold changed the economic calculations of the United States 
and much of the world from China to South America to Europe. Suddenly, there was 
a great deal of gold in circulation everywhere. 
Th ousands of people wanted to get rich quickly by coming to California to fi nd 
the gold. California’s non-Indian population was around 7,000 in 1845. It had grown 
to almost 93,000 in the fi rst U.S. census of 1850. While the fi rst prospectors had come 
from the south—Mexico and South America—and the east—from Pacifi c whaling 
ships, Hawaii, and China—by 1849, the largest numbers were coming from the eastern 
United States and Europe. Getting to California from other parts of the United 
States or Europe could mean a long, slow, and expensive trip by ocean around the 
southern tip of South America. It could also involve a shorter sea voyage to Nicaragua, 
then an overland trek by pack mule across the isthmus, and another voyage from 
there up to San Francisco. Still for others, it could mean traveling overland by walking 
and on ox-drawn wagons across the continent. Sea travel around South America was 
certainly the most comfortable and perhaps safest, but it cost a lot, from $300 to $700, 
and it was slow, taking 4 to 8 months. Th e trip via Nicaragua or Panama was almost 
as expensive, perhaps $600, and dangerous, but it was certainly the fastest, taking 5 to 
8 weeks. Coming by land across the continent was by far the cheapest, costing not 
more than $200, but it also took at least 3 months and had to be timed just right to 
avoid winter on the Rocky Mountains. The majority opted for the cheapest way. 
Small numbers of people had been coming west for decades, but in 1849–50, many 
thousands of prospective Californians traveled along the Platte and Humboldt Rivers 
and then the Oregon and California Trails into the gold fi elds (see Map 11-3 ). 
Th e gold camps themselves were harsh places. Fortunes were made and lost not 
only in the fields but also at gambling tables and through theft and intimidation. 
White Americans, some of them very recent Americans, resented the competition of 
miners from South America and elsewhere, especially those who came from China or 
who were Indians or Californios. Within a short time, most Chinese and Indians miners 
had been driven from the gold fi elds through violence and intimidation, though 
some Indians were retained to work for subsistence wages mining gold for others 
while the Chinese found other kinds of work, eventually building the western railroads 
and developing service industries for miners and others. 
Th e incredible jump in California’s immigrant population came at a terrible cost 
for the California Indians. Th eir population, already declining in the face of the missions, 
declined much more rapidly aft er the beginnings of the Gold Rush because of 
disease and outright murder, decreasing by almost 85 percent between 1848 and 1880 
to 23,000. African slaves were rare both because slave owners knew it was all too easy 
for a slave to escape in California and because other miners hated all competition. 
Few women were able to succeed as miners; indeed, far fewer women than men 
even came to California in the gold rush. Mining camps were overwhelmingly male 
communities. Some women who did come to California were forced or tricked into 
prostitution to pay for their passage from Europe, China, and Latin America. 
Th e most freewheeling era of the gold camps was very short lived. By 1851, the 
chances of fi nding gold by simply looking in a stream bed, as Marshall and Sutter 
had done in 1848, or even fi nding gold with a pan had pretty much ended except in 
the more southerly Tuolumne and Merced gold regions. Some miners began using a 
“rocker” or “cradle” that washed dirt out more quickly. Soon enough, gold mining 
was transformed into large-scale hydraulic mining, which required large corporate 
investments and reduced most miners to hired labor. Even for hired laborers, 
though mining paid much better than most East Coast jobs, the possibility of making 
a fortune evaporated. Gold mining continued and fortunes were still made in the gold 
fi elds, but the Gold Rush was over.

Whaling in the Pacifi c Ocean 
In February 1849, the owners of the whaling ship Minerva from New Bedford, 
Massachusetts, received a letter from its captain. Th e communication reported that, 
aft er hunting whales in the Pacifi c, he had stopped in San Francisco for supplies and to 
recruit more sailors, “but the excitement there in relation to the discovery of gold made 
it impossible to prevent the crew from running away. Th ree of the crew in attempting 
to swim ashore were drowned, and the ship’s company soon became too much 
reduced to continue the whaling voyage.” Th e Minerva thus joined dozens of other 
whaling ships abandoned in San Francisco harbor while their crews sought wealth in 
the California gold fi elds. 
Some sailors no doubt found fortunes in the gold fi elds that had eluded them at 
sea, and some ship owners lost substantial sums when their ships were abandoned, 
but in general, the whaling industry was a source of wealth to some Americans while 
supporting many others and contributing to the growth of the American economy. 
Th e golden age of the American whaling industry began aft er the War of 1812 and 
continued until the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861. During these years, hundreds 
of American ships moved from their earlier and safer whale hunts in the Atlantic to 
2-, 3-, and 4-year voyages to the Pacifi c Ocean. Whale oil, which burned brighter than 
any other fuel available at the time, was used for lamps across the globe. Whale products 
provided oil for the industrial revolution as well as the bone for the hoop dresses 
and corsets that were the height of women’s fashion. Despite British eff orts to launch 
their own whaling fl eets, by the 1830s four-fi ft hs of all the whaling ships in the world 
were American. 
Th e owners and captains of most American whaling ships were mostly men of old 
New England English stock, many of them Quakers, but there were exceptions. A few 
African-Americans, including Paul Cuff ee and Absalom F. Boston, became captains, 
Clipper ships like the famous Flying Cloud made the trip from New York to San Francisco in record speed— 
89 days in one case—while slower whaling ships traveling from New Bedford and other Atlantic ports into 
the Pacifi c often took 2 or 3 years. During the 1830s and 1840s, American sailing ships projected American 
infl uence into the Pacifi c Ocean region as never before.

11.2 
and Cuff ee became a ship owner. Th e crews, white and black, came from almost every 
corner of the globe—Pacifi c Islanders, West Indians, South Americans, or Portuguese. 
Whaling was one of the few occupations in which blacks were paid the same as whites. 
Even a runaway slave could admit, as John Th ompson did in 1840, “I am a fugitive 
slave from Maryland….I thought I would go on a whaling voyage, as being a place 
where I stood least chance of being arrested by slave hunters.” By some estimates, 
10 percent of those who worked on whaling ships were black. Nevertheless, most sailors 
in the whaling business were white men, like Ishmael, the fi ctional narrator of 
Herman Melville’s 1851 novel Moby-Dick, though like the fi ctional Ishmael, the realworld 
whites served as part of racially diverse crews. 
Few women served on whaling ships. There were occasional stories of women 
who hid their gender and embarked with the crew, not easy in the close quarters of a 
small ship on a long voyage. Some captains also took along their wives and children, 
and some crew members said they appreciated having a woman on board who might 
know more medicine than the men and who could sooth an angry captain. 
Whaling ships also explored parts of the world unknown to previous generations 
of Americans. Th e fi rst Americans to enter Japan were whaling sailors. Almost 
a decade before Commodore Perry’s famous voyage to “open up” Japan in 1853–54, 
the Manhattan entered Tokyo harbor in 1845 to return shipwrecked Japanese sailors. 
Th e Superior was the fi rst whaling ship to enter the Arctic Ocean off the coast of 
Alaska in 1848. U.S. whaling ships explored much of the South Pacifi c, sailed off the 
coast of Australia, and explored Antarctica. As a result of the many whaling ships that 
anchored there, Honolulu and San Francisco became major American ports, rivaling 
New Bedford, Boston, and Nantucket. 
The Navy and Diplomacy Across the Pacifi c 
While many American whaling ships had been sailing the Pacifi c since 1815, the 1848 
Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo added a string of Pacifi c ports, especially San Francisco, 
to the United States. Indeed, the push for Pacifi c Ocean ports had been part of the 
driving force behind President Polk’s push for war. The acquisition of those ports 
expanded U.S. interest in the Pacifi c and beyond. By 1851, Daniel Webster, who had 
become secretary of state again under President Fillmore, proclaimed that the United 
States should “command the oceans, both oceans, all the oceans.” 
Central to the “command” of the Pacific Ocean was securing U.S. influence in 
Hawaii. In 1778, the British explorer Captain James Cook was the fi rst European to 
reach the Hawaiian Islands, but by the mid-19th century, the United States had a much 
larger presence in Hawaii. Many Protestant missionaries and merchants began arriving 
in Hawaii in the 1820s where they built churches, schools, and businesses. Missionaries, 
merchants, and whalers boosted the Hawaiian economy, but they also brought alcohol, 
gambling, prostitution, and disease, including venereal diseases that killed many 
Hawaiians and reduced the islanders’ ability to maintain their independence. 
On occasion, the United States did protect the native Hawaiians. An American 
missionary, William Richards, advised King Kamehameha II (r. 1819–1824) on ways 
to maneuver among the great powers and play the United States, Britain, and France 
against each other. In 1842, Secretary of State Daniel Webster added Hawaii to the 
protections of the Monroe Doctrine and made it clear that the United States would 
not tolerate a British or French takeover. In 1851, Webster negotiated a secret treaty 
with King Kamehameha III that, in the event of war, Hawaii would become a U.S. 
protectorate. Webster’s priority was securing trading rights and the use of Honolulu 
as a coaling station for U.S. steamships—merchant vessels and warships—on their 
way to trade with China and Japan. 
Just as the United States gained San Francisco and infl uence in Hawaii, Britain 
was forcing China to open to the West. China saw itself as the center of the world. 
Foreigners were barbarians who might be allowed to trade in a limited way through

the port of Guangzhou but would never be treated as equals. Despite the restrictions, 
American merchants wanted access to more trade with China, and American 
missionaries wanted access to its people. Regardless, both were mostly shut out. 
Losing patience with the Chinese, the British turned to violence. In the so-called 
Opium War (1839–1842), the British forced China to open its ports to British products, 
including opium from British India, and cede Hong Kong Island as a British 
colony. Following in the footsteps of the British, U.S. Ambassador Caleb Cushing 
negotiated the Treaty of Wang-hsia in 1844, which gained the United States the 
same trade rights as the British. 
While Britain took the lead in China, the United States forced the even more 
isolated Empire of Japan to open to the West. The United States wanted Japan as 
another coaling station beyond Hawaii on the route to China and wanted to trade 
with Japan for its own sake. President Fillmore sent Commodore Mathew Perry to 
“open up” Japan and force a “weak and semi-barbarous people” to deal with the 
United States. In July 1853, Perry led four large warships with nearly 1,000 sailors into 
Tokyo Bay and began negotiations. He returned in March 1854 with an even larger 
fl eet. Perry did everything he could to impress the Japanese, providing Japanese offi - 
cials with champagne, Kentucky bourbon, and a history of the war with Mexico to let 
them know what happened to those who opposed United States might. In return, the 
Japanese grudgingly agreed to the Kanagawa Treaty that opened two relatively isolated 
ports to the United States. Only in 1858 did Japan open more ports and establish 
formal diplomatic relations with other countries. Britain quickly became a larger 
economic and military force in Japan than the United States. Nevertheless, the United 
States had established a solid presence in Japan and China by the late 1850s. 
As a result of expansion in the 1840s, the nation’s border was extended to the 
Pacifi c, and U.S. ships sailed everywhere on that ocean. Th e Pacifi c and every nation 
on its shores including China, Japan, and Russian Siberia were in much closer contact 
with the United States than they had been a short time before. Aft er 1848, the United 
States was an emerging force in the world.

CONCLUSION 
From the late 1830s through the 1840s, the United States became a continental power 
whose territory spanned from the Atlantic to the Pacifi c oceans. A strong belief in 
the Manifest Destiny of the United States justified the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 
(though the term was not yet in use) and supported hoped-for territory acquisitions 
from Oregon to Texas to California. Manifest Destiny refl ected the larger belief that 
the United States was specially chosen by divine will to bring liberty and democracy— 
usually in its Jacksonian form—to the planet. 
While Americans discussed Manifest Destiny, the nation experienced hard times 
in the 1830s. Th e fi nancial Panic of 1837, brought on by a worldwide glut in trade, created 
economic uncertainty in the cotton-growing South and the industrial North. It 
took several years for the nation’s economy to recover. 
Many Americans supported versions of Manifest Destiny for varied political or 
economic reasons, while others had grave reservations. Whether one supported or 
opposed slavery played directly into views about expansion, which new territories one 
wanted, and how new territories would be used. Military actions that leaders took in 
the name of Manifest Destiny led to territorial expansion that spanned the continent 
to the Pacifi c coast. 
During the presidency of James Polk, Texas entered the Union as a slave state, 
and aft er a bloody war from 1846 to 1848, Mexico ceded much of what became the 
American West to the United States, including New Mexico and—aided by the 
local Bear Flag Revolt—California. While many Americans, from politicians like 
John Quincy Adams to philosophers like Henry David Th oreau, opposed the War 
with Mexico, many other Americans celebrated the victory and the acquisition of so 
much new territory. Th e United States also ended the joint ownership of the Oregon 
Territory with Britain, and both countries resolved borders that allowed each country 
to have full control of its share. Th e Gold Rush accelerated the settlement of California 
with diverse people, and it produced enormous amounts of gold but decimated the 
American Indian population in the far west. 
Winning California from Mexico dramatically changed the U.S. economy not only 
in terms of gold but also in terms of increased ventures throughout the Pacifi c involving 
whaling and trade. Th e United States now projected Manifest Destiny across an 
ocean where it had few rivals. Th e United States became the world leader in the production 
of whale oil, established a relationship with Hawaii, increased its trade with 
China, and forced Japan to open itself up to the West. Th e intensifi cation of American 
interest in Asia in the 1840s and 1850s refl ected the desire of American policy makers 
to successfully compete with Europe for new markets and coincided with the realization 
of the long-standing desire among many Americans to create a continental 
nation that could become a world power.

MANIFEST DESTINY—THE IMPORTANCE OF AN IDEA 
11.1 
Explain what Manifest Destiny meant and how it led the United 
States to involvement in Texas, California, and Oregon. 
Summary 
The term Manifest Destiny strongly implied that American 
rule over the heart of North America was part of a divine 
plan. For supporters of Manifest Destiny, American expansion 
was closely linked to the spread of Jacksonian democracy 
and Protestant Christianity. Many Americans, from farmers 
to missionaries, supported versions of Manifest Destiny for 
their own reasons. Opponents of Manifest Destiny, including 
most Whigs and almost all opponents of slavery, saw 
more problems than opportunities in expansion. Tensions 
between those Americans living in Texas and those in the 
Mexican government led to war and the establishment of the 
Republic of Texas. Andrew Jackson and Martin Van Buren 
worked hard to increase the strength of the Democratic 
Party. They used that strength to secure Van Buren’s election 
to the presidency in 1836. Van Buren supported the efforts 
of southerners to prevent congressional debate about slavery. 
However, economic problems brought on in part by actions 
taken in the Jackson administration undermined Van Buren’s 
presidency.

11.2 
Analyze the causes, strategies, and outcomes of the U.S. War 
with Mexico. 
Summary 
The desire of the United States to acquire New Mexico and 
California led to hostilities with Mexico. Th e specifi c event that 
triggered the U.S. War with Mexico was a dispute over the border 
between Texas and Mexico. In 1846, President Polk responded to 
a clash between American and Mexican soldiers at the Rio Grande 
as a pretext for war. Th ere was considerable opposition to the war, 
particularly among Whigs. Perhaps the most infl uential response 
to the war came from essayist Henry David Thoreau when he 
wrote Civil Disobedience . Th e war took longer and cost more in 
men and resources than American leaders had anticipated. Th e 
terms of the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo added an enormous 
amount of new territory to the United States. American 
settlers and some Mexicans took steps to separate Alta California 
from Mexico in the years before the U.S. War with Mexico. Th e 
United States supported their eff orts with aid in their Bear Flag 
Revolt. Th e U.S. War with Mexico and the discovery of gold transformed 
Alta California. Th e federal government played an active 
role in the transfer of Mexican-owned lands into the hands of 
American settlers, even though the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo 
promised otherwise. Th e 1848 Gold Rush brought a huge infl ux 
of immigrants into California and enormous wealth to some.

Passage 1 
Seeking the fundamental impulse behind Jacksonian Democracy, 
historians have variously pointed to free enterprise, manhood 
suff rage, the labor movement, and resistance to the market 
economy. But in its origins, Jacksonian Democracy (which 
contemporaries understood as a synonym for Jackson’s 
Democratic Party) was not primarily about any of these, though 
it came to intersect with all of them in due course. In the fi rst 
place it was about the extension of white supremacy across the 
North American continent. By his policy of Indian Removal, 
Jackson confi rmed his support in the cotton states outside South 
Carolina and fi xed the character of his political party. Indian 
policy, not banking or the tariff was the number one issue in the 
national press during the early years of Jackson’s presidency.

In the saga of the Jackson presidency, one marked by both

In 1848, as word of the discovery of gold in California traveled across the 
Pacifi c, a young man in Canton, the capital of Guangdong province in 
China, wrote, “Good many Americans speak of California….Th ey fi nd 
gold very quickly, so I hear.…I think I shall go to California next summer.” 
Halfway around the world in a thatched roof cottage in Ireland, a mother 
was facing the crisis caused by the rotting potato crop and a typhus epidemic 
that had claimed one of her daughters. She told her two remaining 
daughters, “Th ere’s a curse on ould [old] green Ireland and we’ll get out of 
it.” She saved enough money to send one girl, Tilly, to America and, as her 
sister remembered, “She came to Philadelphia and got a place for general 
housework at Mrs. Bent’s.” Tilly saved her money, sent for her sister, and 
eventually, they were able to bring the rest of their family from Ireland. Both 
sisters worked as housekeepers for decades before retiring comfortably aft er 
a lifetime of scrimping and saving. Th e wave of immigration that brought 
people of diverse ethnic backgrounds changed the face of the United States 
dramatically in the 1840s and 1850s. 
During the same years, many who had lived in the United States for generations 
were also going through their own signifi cant changes. Residents of 
the newly expanded country in the Southwest became U.S. citizens as a result 
of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo without moving at all. Slaves and abolitionists

seen before. Slaves rebelled and ran away. Abolitionists—white and black—became 
more determined to end slavery, not just stop its expansion. In response, slaveholders 
became more defi ant and defensive than ever before. When Abraham Lincoln looked 
at a nation that was “half slave and half free” and wondered if it could survive, he was 
not alone. Women, who had struggled for rights since the Revolutionary Era, found 
new voice in the 1830s and 1840s. Th e Seneca Falls Women’s Rights Convention of 
1848 helped to launch a new political movement for women’s rights, including the 
right to vote. While the right to vote was a key demand of the growing women’s right 
movement, other women also demanded a broader equality in all aspects of society, 
insisting that “whatever it is morally right for a man to do, it is morally right for 
a woman to do.” Th is chapter takes a look at the changing nature of the country’s 
racial and ethnic makeup and the thinking of its people, especially about slavery and 
women’s rights, that took place during the 1840s and 1850s. 
THE CHANGING FACE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IN THE 1840s 
AND 1850s 
Analyze how immigration from China, Ireland, and Germany, as well as the incorporation 
of Mexican citizens in the Southwest, changed the United States. 
Immigration and the nation’s expanding borders increased the population of the United 
States in the 1830s, 1840s, and 1850s. A nation of a little fewer than 13 million people in 
1830 included 17 million people in 1840, and the United States had 23 million inhabitants 
in 1850. Births to native-born Americans accounted for the largest part of this 
increase, but many people also crossed oceans to come to the United States, especially 
from Ireland, Germany, and China. By 1860, the United States had about 1.5 million Irishborn 
inhabitants, about 1 million German-born inhabitants, and perhaps 35,000 Chineseborn 
inhabitants—a number that would grow dramatically in the next few years as more 
immigrants from China arrived, especially to build the railroads. Desperately poor people 
in Europe and China fl ed famines in their home countries. Th e California Gold Rush and 
growing U.S. industrialization beckoned with new economic opportunities. Both the push 
of hunger and oppression and the pull of a better future brought many to the United States. 
Th e extraordinary increase in the area of the United States also incorporated many 
people who did not move at all. In 1840, the United States included 1.8 million square 
miles. Less than 10 years later, the country included almost 3 million square miles. 
Some of the land acquired through the war with Mexico was sparsely populated. 
However, many people—Mexican Americans in Texas, New Mexico, and California; 
Mormons in Utah; and the many tribes of Plains and Pueblo Indians—found themselves 
residing within the United States. As a result, the nature of the U.S. population 
shift ed signifi cantly in the late 1840s. 
Th e United States of 1840 could accurately be described as including three major 
ethnic groups—Europeans mostly of English stock, Africans of diff erent backgrounds, 
and American Indians of diverse tribes. Most of the Europeans and many of the Africans 
were Protestants. By 1850, the nation was much more ethnically diverse with many 
Asians (mostly Chinese), Irish, Germans, and Mexican-Americans (of mixed European 
and Indian ancestry). With the growth of these immigrant groups, the United States 
was also a more Catholic country, and with the coming of so many white immigrants, 
the percentage of African-Americans in the population shrank even though their actual 
number grew. While the governing elite was still of European Protestant background, 
the people who made up the country were more diverse than ever before and increasingly 
making their presence felt. Political and military changes traced in the previous 
chapter changed the borders of the United States in the 1830s and 1840s. Th is chapter 
traces the parallel changes in the lives of many people who were, by 1850, residents of 
the United States, whether or not they had been so 20 years before.

12.1 
Chinese Immigration Across the Pacifi c 
Many young people in China were fascinated by the stories from across the Pacifi c. 
Lee Chew described his neighbor’s return to China from the “country of the American 
wizards,” explaining that the man had earned enough in a short stay in the United 
States to build a magnifi cent house and invite his fellow villagers, who lived mostly on 
rice, to a grand feast with roast pig, chicken, and duck. Soon aft er, Lee was on his way 
to California, which became known as Gam Saan (Gold Mountain) on both sides of 
the Pacifi c. 
Before 1840, only a few hundred Chinese lived in the United States, but in the 
1840s and 1850s, Chinese immigrants came to California and to the then-independent 
Kingdom of Hawaii because of a push from China and also a pull from the United 
States and Hawaii. Th ose years were hard in China, especially in Guangdong province 
where most immigrants originated. Under Chinese law, it was illegal for anyone to 
leave China, but in desperate times, thousands did. California was one of many destinations. 
Th e Opium Wars that began in 1839 spawned great violence as British and 
Chinese forces battled and as violent feuds erupted between Chinese communities. 
One Chinese migrant remembered the results of a revolt: “We were left with nothing, 
and in disillusion we went to Hong Kong to sell ourselves as contract laborers.” 
Th e government of the Qing Dynasty, in Beijing, was rapidly losing control of events. 
It was not strong enough to suppress the civil wars or to prevent the British imposition 
of the opium trade on China. 
In addition, the population of China had also grown from some 200 million in 
1762 to 421 million in 1846. With this huge population, land became scarce, rents 
soared, and many peasants could not maintain their meager land holdings. For all 
its ancient expertise in rice cultivation, China simply did not have enough land to 
grow rice for 421 million people. Beginning in 1810, there were terrible famines in 
China, with some of the worst coming in the 1840s. In those four decades, 45 million 
people may have starved to death. Poor people begged for admission to soup kitchens 
or simply died on the doorsteps of the rich. As one immigrant from Guangdong 
remembered, “Sometimes we went hungry for days.…We had only salt and water to 
eat with the rice.” Under such conditions, a fresh start in a new place—temporary or 
permanent—was appealing. 
Americans in Hawaii and California saw Chinese laborers as a key to solving a 
shortage of workers to toil on sugar plantations on Maui or to clear and cultivate 
land in California. The poorest Chinese peasant workers had long been known as 
k’u-li , literally “hard strength,” and the western term for Chinese laborers quickly 
came to be “coolie.” Immediately aft er the conclusion of the U.S. War with Mexico, 
a long-time presidential advisor, Aaron H. Palmer, reported to Congress that “No 
people in all of the East are so well adapted for clearing wild lands and raising every 
species of agricultural product…as the Chinese.” At fi rst, Chinese immigrants were 
warmly welcomed in California. An 1852 article in the Daily Alta California noted, 
“Scarcely a ship arrives that does not bring an increase to this worthy integer of 
our population.” As a result, the Chinese population in the west grew rapidly. Th e 
initial Chinese response to the Gold Rush was relatively small: 325 immigrants from 
China arrived in California in 1849 and 450 more in 1850. Th en the numbers grew 
rapidly: 2,716 in 1851 and 20,026 in 1852. By 1870, Chinese immigrants represented 
nine percent of the population of California (but 25 percent of the work force since 
most Chinese immigrants were men of working age) and larger percentages in 
Oregon and Washington. Th e Chinese also made up 29 percent of the much smaller 
population of Idaho and 10 percent in Montana. 
Nearly 95 percent of Chinese immigrants to California before 1870 were male. Th ey 
tended to see their voyage across the Pacifi c—a harsh 8-week trip—as a temporary 
separation from their families in China. United States law dating from 1790 prohibited 
nonwhite immigrants from achieving citizenship, and most Chinese expected to return

home aft er a few years. In the early years, most male Chinese immigrants joined other 
newcomers in the search for gold. Chinese gold miners could be seen all along the rivers 
of California in their blue cotton blouses and wide-brimmed hats, shoveling sand 
into pans or rockers. Th ese men left wives, fi ancées, children, and parents behind to 
fi nd ways to support them. Chinese culture dictated that a woman should stay with her 
family, especially her husband’s parents, while the man found the means of support. 
Cultural practices such as these and the cost of travel made immigration diffi cult for 
women, though Hawaii was much more welcoming of families than was the United 
States. Of the few Chinese women who avoided the cultural prohibitions and came to 
California before 1870, many were forced to work as prostitutes, either lured into the 
work by false promises or forced into the work by the absence of other ways to survive. 
In 1870, nearly 2,157 of the 3,536 Chinese women in California reported their profession 
as “prostitute.” Only later did other options open for Chinese women. 
As more Chinese entered the gold fi elds, they encountered growing resistance from 
white miners. Th e cry “California for Americans” began in the gold fi elds and was 
picked up by many, including the political leaders of the state. In 1852, the California 
legislature adopted a foreign miners license tax of $3 per month, which was aimed 
specifi cally at the Chinese. It provided between a quarter and a half of state revenue 
before 1870. The tax, and the growing anti-Chinese sentiment that it represented, 
slowed but did not stop Chinese immigration. As the gold fi elds became less productive, 
many Chinese went to work building the railroads. Immediately aft er the Civil 
War, 12,000 Chinese laborers laid the tracks of the Central Pacifi c Railroad. Chinese 
workers also moved into agriculture, mining, fi shing, and later into urban businesses. 
Men from China oft en found work at the least desirable jobs or jobs that other men 
considered to be “women’s work,” including starting the ubiquitous Chinese laundries 
that were solely a Chinese-American development. Although many individual 
Chinese immigrants returned home after a few years, other Chinese immigrants 
stayed in the United States, creating permanent communities in the American West. 
Miners of many nationalities competed for gold in the California gold fi elds, but the tensions, especially 
between miners of European origin and Chinese miners, were severe, and most Chinese miners were driven 
from the gold fi elds before long.

Irish and German Immigration of the 1840s and 1850s 
Th e Irish who came to the United States as a result of the Great Famine of the late 
1840s were not the first Irish to come to America, but they came from a different 
part of Ireland than their predecessors and for diff erent reasons. Most Irish who 
had come before or immediately aft er the Revolution were Irish Protestants, mainly 
Presbyterians whose ancestors had emigrated from Scotland to Ireland. Th e Protestant 
Irish, who became known as Scots Irish, settled in all the colonies, but especially along 
the rural frontier from Pennsylvania to the Carolinas. Aft er the American Revolution, 
and especially aft er the failure of an Irish rebellion of 1798 against the British, more 
Irish immigrants, both Catholic and Protestant, arrived. 
Th e roots of the Great Famine of 1845–1850 go deep in Irish history—anchored 
in a rapidly growing population of poor people; in policies that made most people 
almost totally dependent on a single, easy-to-raise crop rather than a diversifi ed 
agriculture; and in British policies that forced Irish Catholics to labor for Protestant 
landowners. But its immediate cause was a plant fungus of unknown sources that 
devastated potatoes. A potato disease, which had already aff ected parts of continental 
Europe, came to Ireland with surprising rapidity. August 1845 was unusually 
wet with heavy rains, and the early spread of the disease left potatoes, as one 
observer said, “blighted and mildewed” and inedible. In 1846, the blight struck with 
full force, and up to 90 percent of the fall potato crop was lost. For many landless 
Catholics, there was no other substantial food source. Th e result was widespread 
starvation. Potato crops continued to be blighted each year through 1850, and 
cholera struck in 1848 and 1849. Out of a total Irish population of approximately 
8 million, more than 1 million people died from disease or starvation in the 5 years 
of the Great Famine. During the decade that followed the start of the famine, over 
2 million people left Ireland, most of them for the United States. 
One observer described the suff ering of the Great Famine: 
Th ey died in their mountain glens, they died along the sea-coast, they died on 
the roads, and they died in the fi elds; they wandered into the towns, and died 
in the streets; they closed their cabin doors, and lay down upon their beds, and 
died of actual starvation in their own homes. 
And when they could, they left . Th e cost of the trip to America was about 3 British 
pounds, about the same as the cost of a new cow or the annual rent on a farm. As 
the historian Cormac Ó Gráda noted, “In the hierarchy of suff ering the poorest of 
the poor emigrated to the next world; those who emigrated to the New World had the 
resources to escape.” Somehow, many found the funds to make the trip. Even when 
a family could scrape together enough funds to get only one family member off to 
America, there was a good chance that, if the rest could survive another winter or two, 
then they too would immigrate. In 1848, Irish immigrants to America sent 500,000 
British pounds, a signifi cant amount of money, back to Ireland to feed relatives and 
pay for their transport out of the country (see Map 12-1 ). 
In the 1840s, the voyage from Ireland across the Atlantic was terrible. Th e ships, 
which took 5–6 weeks to make the crossing, became known as “coffi n ships” because 
of the high death toll due to poor nutrition, unsanitary conditions, and overcrowding. 
Once in the United States, the new Irish immigrants, overwhelmingly Catholic 
and poor, were seen as another race by Americans of English and especially Scotch- 
Irish origin. Centuries of deep hostility toward the Irish among English Protestants 
had been continued by their American descendants, who viewed Catholicism as a 
degrading religion and, thus, the Irish, particularly the throngs of devastatingly poor 
Irish, as an inferior race. Nevertheless, though many Irish immigrants lived in terrible 
poverty, they came at a good time to get a foothold in the American economy. Women 
immigrants got work as household domestic help for native-born middle-class 
Americans. Irish women and men also labored in the factories where their willingness

to work hard made them prized employees. In addition, Irish men 
did the backbreaking work of building the nation’s fastest-growing 
cities, most of all New York, which became the center of the 
country’s Irish population. Irish immigrants also moved to Boston, 
Philadelphia, Chicago, and smaller cities from New Jersey to 
California. Few of the Irish moved to farms; it was too expensive 
to start a farm, and farming had little appeal to those who remembered 
the famine that had sparked their journey. After the Civil 
War, Irish laborers built the eastern end of the Transcontinental 
Railroad just as Chinese laborers built the western end. 
Wherever the Irish Catholic immigrants settled, they created 
their own communities, including a Catholic church usually led by 
an Irish priest. By 1850, the Catholic Church had become the largest 
single denomination in the United States. 
While Irish immigration was especially dramatic and rapid 
because of the famine, many other Europeans, including more than 
1 million Germans, also came to the United States in the 1840s and 
1850s. On average, German immigrants came with slightly more 
fi nancial resources than the Irish, and many settled on farms or in 
cities in what was becoming the Midwest. In new and growing cities 
like Milwaukee, St. Louis, and Chicago, the majority of residents 
were foreign-born, mostly from Germany. 
German immigrant communities often kept to themselves as 
opposed to the Irish who took jobs in the households of native-born 
families or the factories of native-born owners. German-dominated 
immigrant farm towns and German neighborhoods were recognized 
and sometimes distrusted by the native-born elite, but German immigrants 
provoked less distrust than Irish immigrants. German immigrants 
introduced many traditions into American culture—from the 
Christmas tree to beer, both of which were relatively unknown in the 
United States until the Germans introduced them. One American 
observer described his surprise at visiting an isolated German community 
in the Southwest where people drank “coff ee in tin cups,” while listening 
to “a Beethoven symphony on the grand piano.” Along religious 
lines, the Germans were a diverse group. Many were Catholics, but 
there were also many Protestants, including Lutherans and the Amish. 
Even though the Irish and German immigrants played a crucial 
role in expanding the American economy, the rapid growth of 
these new European groups also frightened many native-born 
Americans. The Irish were particularly vulnerable to prejudice 
because there was a long history of discrimination against the 
Irish, especially Irish Catholics, even before the Great Famine. In 
August 1834, a Protestant mob burned the convent and school of 
the Ursuline nuns in Boston. Boston’s Catholic bishop Benedict 
Fenwick wrote, “No law or justice is to be expected in this land 
where Catholics are constantly calumniated and the strongest 
prejudices exist against them. Shame!” Perhaps because of their 
relative isolation, the Germans provoked somewhat less hostility, but many nativeborn 
Americans expressed their anger at German immigrants who created communities 
where English was not the primary language. 
With the growth of the Irish Catholic and German populations in the late 1840s, 
the prejudice grew. An anti-immigrant group called the Native American Association 
was founded in 1837, and by 1845, it had become a political party known as the 
Know Nothing Party because when members were asked about the party, they were

told to say “I know nothing.” In the 1850s, the Know-Nothings elected eight governors, 
more than 100 members of Congress, mayors in several major cities, and many state 
legislators. Th e Know-Nothing Party’s platform was anti-Catholic and anti-immigrant, 
including plans to limit Catholic political power, in part, by banning immigrants from 
holding offi ce and requiring them to wait 21 years to become citizens. 
Moderate reformers like Horace Mann were horrified by the burning of the 
Ursuline convent in Boston and the political platform of the Know-Nothings but 
still sought to ensure that the public school system was used to make all future 
citizens, especially immigrants, into good “Americans” as they understood the term. 
Massachusetts Governor Edward Everett told the state’s school board to “save society 
not with the cannon and the rifl e, but with the spelling book, the grammar, and the 
Bible.” Nevertheless, despite hostility and their own poverty, Irish and German immigrants 
eventually gained political and economic power in the nation’s major cities. 
The Mexican Experience in the Southwest 
In 1847, as immigrants to America were trying to fit in to the new culture, Father 
Antonio Jose Martinez was trying to keep peace in his own community of Taos, New 
Mexico, where Mexican and Pueblo Indian residents had rebelled against the new 
American authorities, killing the American appointed governor, Charles Bent. Father 
Martinez tried to convince rebels that killing Americans was wrong and futile while 
trying to convince the Americans to give due process to insurgents. He was not fully 
successful in either eff ort, but by the end of 1847, the rebellion had ended aft er a group 
of rebels were defeated by U.S. soldiers. Like the rebels he was seeking to defend, 
Father Martinez had suddenly become an American citizen, no longer a citizen of 
the Republic of Mexico, not because he moved, but because the American border had 
moved hundreds of miles south and his home was now in a diff erent country. 
Under the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, territory that was home to Pueblo, 
Navajo, Comanche, Apache, Ute, and Cheyenne tribes as well as Spanish settlements, 
some dating back 300 years, was now part of the United States. While in the short 
Native-born Americans, especially those in the Know Nothing Party, reacted with fear and anger to the surge 
in immigration to the United States during the 1830s and 1840s. Some of the stereotypes included images 
of whiskey-drinking Irish and beer-drinking Germans in a country that was turning its back on its own hard 
drinking ways.

run, the treaty had little impact on Native Americans, it almost immediately had a 
huge impact on people who were now Mexican Americans. Th e 1848 treaty gave every 
Mexican citizen within the new boundary of the United States the right to American 
citizenship or the right to keep Mexican citizenship. Mexico urged its citizens who 
lived to the north of the new border to move to Mexico, and some 4,000 people from 
New Mexico and smaller groups from Texas, California, and Arizona did move south, 
back in to Mexico. But most former Mexican citizens chose to stay in their homes and 
make new lives as citizens of the United States. Th eir choice turned out to be a diffi cult 
experience for them, however. 
Many within the Mexican community in California were initially optimistic about 
their new country. Indeed, quite a few of the Mexican leaders in California, men such 
as Mariano Vallejo and Juan Bandini, had been hoping for an American takeover of 
their territory even before the War with Mexico because they saw the United States 
as a vibrant democracy that could replace the distant and inept Mexican administration. 
When the constitutional convention met in Monterey in August 1849 to prepare 
California for statehood, eight of the 48 voting delegates were Californios (as former 
Mexican citizens were called). On most matters, they did not vote as a separate bloc, 
assuming that their interests and those of newer American residents were the same. Th e 
huge population surge of the gold rush, however, meant that the Californios quickly 
became a small minority in California. By the time that statehood came in 1850, they 
numbered only about 13,000 out of a non-Indian population of over 100,000. 
Ultimately, the sheer numbers of those newly arrived from the United States 
destroyed the economic base for the culture that Mexican citizens like Vallejo represented. 
Looking back, Vallejo described the impact of statehood and the gold rush on 
California when “legal thieves, clothed in the robes of the law, took from us our lands 
and our houses, and without the least scruple, enthroned themselves in our homes 
like so many powerful kings.” Vallejo’s dreams of being an equal citizen of the United 
States never materialized. 
The vehicle by which the “legal thieves” stole the land of the Californians was 
established even before statehood was granted: the United States Land Commission 
was set up specifi cally to challenge the Mexican land grants on which Vallejo’s and his 
compatriot’s fortunes rested. Although the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo had promised 
that all residents of these lands “shall be maintained and protected in the free 
enjoyment of their liberty and property,” the Land Commission treated every grant as 
invalid until documented and proven. Th e result was that many of the old families lost 
their land. Being of Mexican descent in California meant second-class citizenship for 
a long time to come. 
In Texas, the Mexican, or Tejano, population was also small. Like their counterparts 
in California, the Tejanos did not fare well aft er Texas joined the United States. 
Juan Seguin, one of the heroes on the Texas and American side of the decisive battle of 
San Jacinto and mayor of San Antonio, eventually joined the exodus to Mexico. In San 
Antonio, the city with the largest Tejano population, the number of Tejanos elected to 
offi ce, which had been high under the Republic of Texas, declined sharply once statehood 
was achieved. New migrants from the United States took over the political and 
economic control of the state. 
The Mexican or Hispano elite in New Mexico fared better because American 
newcomers remained a minority in New Mexico throughout the 19th century. Th e 
Hispano elite were a majority in the fi rst American territorial assembly held in 1851, 
and they published its proceedings in both Spanish and English. Merchants from the 
United States had played a signifi cant role in New Mexico since the 1820s when the 
Santa Fe Trail connected St. Louis with Santa Fe. 
Despite the revolts in northern New Mexico aft er U.S. annexation, many in the 
territory made their peace with the new government, and some made fortunes in 
the new economy. Gertrudis Barcelo achieved both fame and fortune for the elegant 

364 Part V Expansion, Separation, and a New Union, 1844–1877 
12.3 
saloon and gambling house she controlled in Santa Fe. Barcelo’s saloon was a fi xture 
for Santa Fe Trail traders from the 1820s to the 1850s and a business of suffi cient success 
to allow her to make signifi cant bequests to charity and leave three houses and 
other wealth to her heirs when she died in 1852. Barcelo was not alone in attending to 
her own interests whether the fl ag of Spain, Mexico, or the United States fl ew on the 
plaza near her establishment. 
For many poor people in the Southwest, however, the transfer of authority from 
Mexico to the United States meant increased poverty and far less opportunity for justice 
in a court system that was operated in a strange language by people who were oft en 
fi lled with racial and ethnic prejudices. Not surprisingly, the term vigilante (meaning 
people who take justice into their own hands rather than rely on lawful authorities) 
came from the Committees of Vigilance in the California mining camps. Vigilante 
groups made up of private citizens took the administration of justice into their own 
hands when they thought that the official government authorities were absent or, 
too oft en, when they did not like their decisions. Members of these groups delivered 
public whippings and lynched people they did not like, whether or not a crime had 
been committed. California mobs lynched at least 163 Mexicans between 1848 and 
1860. In southern California, a white gang known as the El Monte boys used the 
hysteria around a short-lived Mexican rebellion to settle old scores and attack Mexican 
families regardless of whether they had been involved in the rebellion. Similar outrages 
happened across the West. Still, in Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona, the Latino 
presence remained strong. 
The Mexican American community fought back as it could. One Californio, 
Joaquin Murrieta, became a California legend—feared in the white community, 
honored in the Mexican community—because of his vengeance on those who had 
stolen his gold claim, raped his wife Rosa, and hung his brother. Murrieta stole 
horses and gold and killed those who had raped and murdered his loved ones before 
he, in turn, was discovered and killed by the California Rangers in 1853. Kangaroo 
courts ( unauthorized and obviously biased courts) and lynchings were all too common 
within and across all ethnic lines as traditional community relationships were 
destroyed by distance and greed.

How did immigrants react to their new American surroundings? 
SLAVERY IN THE UNITED STATES, 1840s AND 1850s 
Explain how the lives of slaves, slaveholders, and abolitionists evolved in the decades 
before the Civil War. 
Th e institution of slavery had existed in the United States from the nation’s beginning, 
but slavery, which had never been a static institution, changed signifi cantly yet 
again aft er 1820 (see Chapter 9 ) . For enslaved people and those who claimed to own 
them, life in a slave society was a diff erent experience at diff erent points in history. 
Slavery was always harsh and dehumanizing, but it was harsh in diff erent ways at 
diff erent times. 
Aft er the end of the War of 1812, Southern planters experienced new economic 
benefits from slavery, benefits that grew with each decade as the world’s cotton 
market exploded and slave labor, as well as developments in technology and 
transportation, made it possible and profi table for American slave-grown cotton to 
satisfy the market. Since most cotton was produced by slave labor, the new demand 
for cotton greatly increased the value of individual slaves. Th us, just as slavery was 
dying out in the North—for both economic and ethical reasons—the new cotton 
economy of the South made slavery far more profi table than ever before. Th e result

was a kind of industrialized agriculture that by the 1840s produced 60 percent of 
the world’s cotton and made the South, and particularly some elite Southerners, 
extremely wealthy. With the increase in profits and wealth, many slaveholders 
developed what they claimed was a new ethical rationale for slavery and challenged 
their critics head on (see Map 12-2 ). 
Slaves and Slave Masters 
As cotton prices kept increasing in the 1830s, and especially in the 1840s and 1850s, 
close to a million slaves were moved from the coast, where many had cultivated 
tobacco, indigo, and other crops, to new cotton states, where they had to learn the 
diff erent and diffi cult work of tending cotton. Yet even as slavery was becoming 
more profi table, Northern public opinion was turning against it. More people were 
joining what had been a small group of abolitionists in viewing human bondage as 
a terrible wrong and a stain on the honor of a nation dedicated to human freedom. 
With slavery disappearing in the North, Northern abolitionists got an increasingly 
responsive hearing from their neighbors. Other Northerners who had fewer moral 
qualms about slavery saw slaves as competitors for scarce jobs, and they too joined 
the opposition to slavery. In 1840, antislavery forces created the Liberty Party and 
nominated James G. Birney for president, and in 1848, the short-lived antislavery 
Free Soil Party nominated former President Martin Van Buren as its candidate. 
Neither party campaigned for outright abolition, only for an end to extending slavery 
to new areas of the country. Nor did either party win any electoral votes, though

belt states of the Deep South. For an individual slave, the further north one was, the better one’s chances 
were to connect to the Underground Railroad, but slaves from every part of the South made their way north 
to freedom.

Van Buren did win some 10 percent of the popular vote in 1848. Nevertheless, 
abolitionist rhetoric and political muscle were frightening an increasingly defensive 
slaveholding South. 
Slaveholders and their political and intellectual allies responded to both the 
increased profi t and the increased criticism. In the past, most slaveholders, including 
all of those from the South who attended the Constitutional Convention, had 
defended slavery as a “necessary evil.” Somehow, they argued, slavery had become an 
economic and social necessity that was, at best, unfortunate. However, aft er 1830, a 
new generation of slaveholders began to describe slavery as a positive good, an institution 
that Christianized “heathen” Africans while providing them with food, shelter, 
and an ordered life. Th ese new defenders of slavery also contrasted it with work in 
Northern factories and noted that slaves, unlike factory workers, were not fi red when 
work got slow or they grew old, but rather, were provided for throughout their lives. 
Southern apologists also became increasingly angry with Northern critics of slavery. 
One example of the new proslavery ideology was the changing views of Roger B. 
Taney, who served as Chief Justice of the United States from 1836 to 1864. As a young 
attorney in Maryland in 1819, Taney defended a Methodist preacher, Jacob Gruber, 
who had warned it was inevitable that slaves would “rise up and kill your children, 
their oppressors.…” When Maryland charged Gruber with breaking the peace and 
inciting rebellion, Taney asserted Gruber’s legal right to free speech and said that slavery 
was, “a blot on our national character, and every real lover of freedom, confi dently 
hopes that it will be …wiped away.” 
In 1857, however, almost 40 years aft er the Gruber trial and 20 years aft er Taney’s 
appointment to lead the Supreme Court, he wrote in reference to the Dred Scott 
decision (see Chapter 13 ) that blacks were “altogether unfit to associate with the 
white race, either in social or political relations; and so far inferior, that they had no 
rights which the white man was bound to respect.” Th e Chief Justice, like many other 
Southerners, had come to see slavery as simply the inevitable result of black inferiority. 
Taney was far from alone. 
As every able-bodied slave and every new-born slave child became more valuable 
from 1800 to the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, any thought of abolishing slavery 
disappeared among slaveholders. Aft er 1830, Southern states also made it more 
diffi cult to set any slaves free and for free blacks to stay in the South. 
The apologists for slavery never tired of pointing out the diff erence between the supposedly contented life 
of Southern slaves and the harsh lives of factory workers in the Northern states and Great Britain.

12.3 
Th e growing value of individual slaves also led—ironically—to somewhat better 
treatment for them. A slave life was now of too much economic value to be lost easily. 
The same states that made it difficult to free slaves passed new laws against their 
murder or mistreatment. In many instances, the nutrition and medical care provided 
for slaves also improved. 
A healthy, relatively well-fed slave could work harder than a sickly or starving slave. 
A pregnant slave could produce a valuable new slave who could, in time, also work or 
be sold. However, a slave who died of mistreatment was a lost investment. Th ere is 
evidence that the actual treatment of slaves, while never approaching anything that 
could be called humane, did improve throughout the 19th century. Where multiple 
slave families had been crammed into cramped quarters, more plantation owners 
built—or had their slaves build—individual family cabins with board fl oors instead of 
dirt. More meat was added to slave diets, and slaves were allowed to grow their own 
vegetable gardens as well as hunt and fi sh to supplement their diet. Slave hours of 
work were controlled by custom and unspoken agreement; most slaves had Sunday as 
a day of rest, and except in harvest time, few were expected to work aft er dark. A new 
generation of slave children was allowed to play relatively freely until put to work at 
age 10 to 12. Former slave Harriet Jacobs wrote, “I was born a slave; but I never knew 
it till six years of happy childhood has passed away.” For defenders of slavery like 
Edmund Ruffi n, such improvements in the lives of slaves became proof that slave life 
was better than the lives of some Northern or European workers and peasants. 
Edmund Ruffin (1794–1865) was a Southern agronomist who in 
the 1850s turned from improving the productivity of Southern 
soil to defending Southern slavery. He published several proslavery 
articles and pamphlets (this one probably in 1860 or 1861), 
advocated succession of the Southern states after Lincoln’s election, 
and fought in the first battles of the Civil War. At the end of the Civil 
War, he committed suicide rather than live under what he called 
“Yankee rule.” 
The privilege of the English laborer to choose his employment 
and his master, even when such choice legally exists, does not 
prevent his service being truly slavery. For he has no choice but to 
toil incessantly for wages barely affording a scant and wretched 
support, or to starve—and no change of pursuit, or of service, 
can make that condition better.…[I]n comparison to the English 
pauper, and even to his earlier condition as the over-worked, 
under-fed and suffering hireling laborer, supporting a family on 
regular wages, the general condition of our negro slaves is one of 
comfort, ease and happiness.… 
Until recent investigation and discussion had elicited more 
truth, it had been claimed by the people of the North and by all the 
opposers of slavery, and even was generally admitted by the people 
of the Southern States, that the free-labour States of New England 
were greatly superior to the old Southern States in obtaining the 
fruits of industry and capital.…Southern capital and industry were 
almost exclusively devoted to agriculture—northern capital was 
much more vested in commerce and manufactures, which are 
deemed much more profitable than agricultural investments.…It 
has also been especially and loudly claimed, for and by the people 
of the New England States. . . that such difference was the necessary 
result of the blighting and demoralizing effects of negro slavery in 
the South, and of its absence in the North.… 
Instead of our labors and investments in slave-labor being 
less profitable than northern operations, it is manifest that the 
slaveholding States are much richer than the free States, and to 
make this result the more striking, even if counting every slave as 
if free, and supposing the whole property to be divided among 
all the population, (slaves included,) still on this general average, 
the individual share of every one, bond or free, would be considerably 
larger than in the free States.

Th e slave population of the United States grew from 1.5 million slaves in 1820 
to 4 million slaves in 1860. Aft er 1808, it was illegal and diffi cult to bring new slaves 
into the country, so much of this growth refl ected reproduction among existing slaves. 
Many saw this growth as a sign of the new and better treatment that slaves were receiving. 
In the United States slaves were surviving, reproducing, and providing signifi cant 
profi ts to others. 
Although some improvements in slave life occurred, there were limits to those 
developments. Th e slave cabins were hot and stuff y in summer and infl ammable in 
winter. Th e meals were monotonous. Th e work for adults was backbreaking, being 
called out to work at 4:00 or 5:00 a.m., and then working in hot fi elds, hoeing or picking 
cotton, with little break until sunset. Slaves were whipped routinely for falling 
behind in their work or for infractions of the plantation rules. While some Southern 
reformers talked of honoring slave marriages, the separation of spouses continued 
without interruption. Slave women could not protect their own bodies. Harriet Jacobs 
also remembered that once she came of age, “It was deemed a crime in her to wish to 
be virtuous.” And she spent considerable time avoiding the constant advances of the 
owner of her plantation and the jealous anger of his wife. Many slave women were not 
so fortunate, and the rape of slave women by white men was a commonly acknowledged 
reality. Mary Boykin Chestnut, wife of a plantation owner, described the treatment 
of slave women as a “monstrous system,” and noted that “Any lady is ready to 
tell you who is the father of all the mulatto children in everybody’s household but her 
own. Th ose, she seems to think, drop from the clouds.” Even laws that were being 
passed against murdering a slave could be enforced only if there was a white witness 
because slaves were not allowed to testify in court. Most of all, nothing could change 
the fact that slavery was still slavery. No amount of reform or improvement could 
change that reality. 
In the midst of appalling conditions, slaves created lives for themselves and developed 
the psychological strength to withstand the horrors they faced. Historians have 
argued whether slave life was better on the small family farms that included only a 
few slaves or on large plantations with many. In reality, it probably depended on the 
conditions and the owner of an individual farm or plantation. Slaves on small farms 
Slave quarters, like these shown on a South Carolina plantation, provided better living conditions than 
what was provided to previous generations of slaves, though hardly anything that could be called 
comfortable. The houses built close together also fostered a sense of community life that helped enslaved 
people survive.

worked alongside the owners and oft en shared the same meals. But if the owner was 
cruel, there was little respite from the suff ering, and it was hard to maintain connections 
with other slaves. If the owner ran short of funds, and many did, it was all too 
easy to cut the food and clothing of the slaves. Working conditions on a large plantation 
with several hundred slaves could be much harsher, but slaves had more opportunity 
to create a community and cultural identity of their own, and oft en, the routines 
and expectations were more regularized. 
On large plantations, the work life of slaves was usually controlled by an overseer, 
often a poor white whom the plantation owner hired to get as much work—and 
profi t—from the slaves as possible. Slaves and overseers had to develop a working 
relationship of sorts, however tense it might be. An overseer who was too lax would 
not produce the profi ts an owner expected; one who was too cruel could also be 
unproductive. Th e owner of one of Alabama’s larger plantations, A. H. Arrington, 
wrote in his diary, “I have this day discharged my overseer, Mr. Brewer. I found 
so much dissatisfaction amongst the negroes that I placed under his charge that I 
could not feel satisfi ed to continue him in my employment.” Such decisions were 
not uncommon. While overseers had total legal control over the slaves, slaves also 
knew that for any work to get done at all, an accommodation had to be reached 
In the late 1930s, Susan Merritt was interviewed near Marshall, 
Texas, not far from where she had once been a slave, by historians 
working for the Federal Writers’ Project. She estimated herself to be 
87 years old but still remembered slavery all too well. 
I couldn’t tell how old I is, but does you think I’se ever 
forget them slave days?…I’se born right down in Rusk County 
[Texas], not a long way from Henderson, and Massa Andrew 
Watt am my owner. My pappy, Hob Rollins, he come from North 
Carolina and belonged to Dave Blakely and Mammy come from 
Mississippi. Mammy have eleven of us chillen, but four dies 
when they babies. Albert, Hob, John, Emma, Anna, Lula, and me 
lives to be grown and married. 
Massa Watt lived in a big log house what set on a hill so you 
could see it round for miles, and us lived over in the field in little 
log huts, all huddled along together. They have homemade beds 
nailed to the wall and baling sack mattresses, and us call them 
bunks. Us never had no money but plenty clothes and grub, and 
wear the same clothes all the year ‘round. Massa Watt made our 
shoes for winter hisself. He made furniture and saddles and harness, 
and run a grist mill and a whiskey still there on the place. 
That man had everything. 
The hands was woke with the bit bell…They was in that field 
before day and stay till dusk dark. They work up till Saturday 
night and then washes their clothes, and sometimes they gets 
through and has time for the party and plays ring plays.… 
When the hands come in from the field at dusk dark, they has 
to tote water from the spring and cook and eat; and be in bed 
when that old bell rings at nine o’clock. About dusk they calls 
the chillen and gives ‘em a piece of corn pone about the size my 
hand and a tin cup milk and puts them to bed. But the growed 
folks et fat pork and greens and beans and such like and have 
plenty milk. Every Sunday Massa give ‘em some flour and butter 
and a chicken. Lots…caught a good cowhiding for slippin’ 
round and stealin’ a chicken ‘fore Sunday. Massa Watt didn’t have 
no overseer…He carry a long whip round the neck and I’s seed 
him tie [slaves] to a tree and cowhide ‘em till the blood run down 
onto the ground.… 
Lots of times Massa Watt give us a pass to go over to George 
Petro’s place or Dick Gregg’s place. Massa Petro run a slave market 
and he have big, high scaffold with steps where he sells 
slaves. They was stripped off to the waist to show their strength. 
Our white folks have a church and a place for us in the back. 
Sometimes at night us gather ‘round the fireplace and pray and 
sing and cry, but us darn’t ‘low our white folks know it. Thank the 
Lord us can worship where we wants nowadays.

between their white masters and themselves. Slaves knew how to make the most 
of what power they had. It was risky to complain about an overseer, but it was less 
risky to feign illness, even pregnancy, and more slaves did that. Some slaves feigned 
clumsiness and broke tools that then had to be repaired; others pretended laziness 
and attempted to slow the pace of work. Resistance took many ingenious forms, and 
it helped slaves survive. 
Especially on larger plantations, slave families were also essential to the emotional, 
and oft en physical, survival of their members. While slaves were not allowed legally 
recognized marriages, many slave partnerships lasted for a long time while others 
were disrupted by the sale of one partner or the tensions that drive people apart in 
any circumstance. Slave parents, especially mothers, had a diffi cult task, loving children 
while also preparing them for the rigors of slavery. Many former slaves recalled 
parents being especially tough in ways that, as adults, they recognized as the most 
loving thing slave parents could do. Aft er all, to allow a slave child to grow to adulthood 
without proper preparation for a world in which submission (at least outward 
signs of submission) was key to survival was to give that child a death sentence. Some 
slave mothers simply could not endure the thought of children they loved being raised 
to be slaves. One former slave told the story of a mother who, aft er seeing three children 
sold away from her, gave her fourth child “something out of a bottle” and soon 
it was dead: “’Couse didn’t nobody tell on her or he’d [the owner] of beat her nearly 
to death.” 
Resisting Slavery 
Enslaved people found many diff erent ways to resist their enslavement. For those with no 
other options, they could pretend illness, laziness, or stupidity to resist their circumstances. 
Slave labor could be notoriously slow when slaves actively tried to subvert the work of a 
plantation, doing just enough work to avoid punishment. But passive resistance was not 
the only kind of resistance. Newspaper advertisements for runaway slaves give solid evidence 
that thousands and thousands of slaves tried to run away from the places where 
they were held. While many runaways were caught, many tried again and again to fi nd 
shelter in free states of the North or in Canada, and quite a few succeeded. And fi nally, in 
every generation, there were full-scale slave revolts, some small and some large, in which 
enslaved people attacked their oppressors and sought to claim their freedom. 
RUNAWAY SLAVES In 1837, Joseph Taper and his family ran away from their lives as 
slaves on a Virginia plantation. It was a dangerous decision to do so. Th e chances of 
being caught were great and the punishments harsh—perhaps fl ogging, perhaps having 
the family separated and sold into the Deep South, farther from the opportunity 
for a second escape, perhaps being killed. 
At fi rst, the Tapers made their way to Pennsylvania where Joseph Taper found 
work. But when he read the off er of a reward for his return, the family moved further 
north and eventually left the United States for Canada in 1839. Britain had abolished 
slavery in all its dominions in 1833, making it illegal for slave hunters to seek former 
slaves there. In November 1840, a year aft er their arrival in Canada, Joseph Taper 
wrote of his journey “that I am in a land of liberty, in good health.…My wife and self 
are sitting by a good comfortable fi re happy, knowing that there are none to molest or 
make afraid.” 
As happy as the Taper story was, the long and dangerous journey north was frightening 
for any slave who sought to escape. Harriet Jacobs escaped from slavery by boat 
in 1843. She remembered that even aft er she was safely on the boat, 
We were fi lled with constant apprehensions that the constables would come 
on board. Neither could I feel quite at ease with the captain…might he not 
be tempted to make more money by giving us up to those who claimed us as 
property?”

12.3 
But she was relieved when, “the next morning I was on deck as soon as the day 
dawned…for the fi rst time in our lives, on free soil.” Nevertheless, though she had 
successfully escaped from slavery, Jacobs remembered the next days as diffi cult ones. 
She was lonely, having “left dear ties behind us; ties cruelly sundered by the demon 
Slavery.” 
Th e Taper and Jacobs stories are unusual. Most slaves who ran away were quickly 
caught. Th e route to freedom in the North was known as the Underground Railroad , 
a highly secret system of safe havens and supporters that guided slaves toward a new, 
free life. It was a symbol for many but a reality for only a few. Nevertheless, every year 
more and more slaves were aided by “conductors” who were either former slaves who 
had run away or free people, black and white, who hated slavery and were willing 
to take enormous risks to help new people on the road to freedom. Conductors on 
the Underground Railroad knew the hidden paths and the safe houses where sympathetic 
owners were willing to hide runaway slaves as they journeyed ever further 
north, either to cities in the United States or, increasingly, out of the United States to 
Canada. Both Taper and Jacobs were among the few slaves who were literate, which 
helped them elude the authorities and prosper. But they were not nearly so unusual in 
deciding to run away from slavery. 
Advertisements that appeared in Southern newspapers in the 19th century off ered considerable 
detail about runaway slaves. One 1850 issue of the New Orleans Daily Picayune 
reported the off er of rewards for Jack, Sam, Zip or Harry, Edward, Daniel, Henrietta, Mary 
Mackendish, William, and Tom. By 1860, some 50,000 slaves ran away every year out of 
a total slave population of 4 million who were held by 385,000 slave owners, which meant 
that one in seven slaveholders could expect someone to run away each year. 
Runaway slaves became abolitionists and, later, national leaders during 
Reconstruction. Henry Highland Garnet, whose adult writing inspired fear in the 
hearts of many slaveholders, was born a slave in Maryland. While he was a child, his

Support system set up by antislavery groups 
in the upper South and the North to assist 
fugitive slaves in escaping the South. 
By far the most famous conductor on the Underground Railroad, Harriet Tubman, shown here with a few of 
the perhaps 300 people she led north out of slavery, ran away from slavery and then returned to the South 
again and again to lead others to freedom.

family set out on the pretext of going to the funeral of a slave on a nearby plantation 
but went instead to the home of a Quaker Underground Railroad conductor in 
Delaware who started them on the road to freedom in New York City where each 
member of the family took a new name in a ceremony of “baptism to Liberty.” 
Frederick Douglass was born a slave in Maryland around 1817. Douglass 
remembered visits from his mother who lived on another plantation 12 miles away and 
made the journey on foot at night before returning for the next day’s work: “She was a 
fi eld hand, and a whipping is the penalty for not being in the fi eld at sunrise…I do not 
recollect of ever seeing my mother by the light of day.” 
Douglass made his fi rst attempt to run away in 1835 but was caught and sent to a 
former master in Baltimore. Instead of giving in to the fear of capture, Douglass tried 
again 3 years later and succeeded in running away to freedom in New York in 1838. 
Harriet Tubman became famous as a slave who not only ran away but also returned 
to the South and guided between 200 and 300 others along the Underground Railroad 
to freedom. By most reckonings, she was responsible for freeing more slaves than any 
other person in the institution’s long history. 
Tubman was born about 1820. Two of her older sisters were sold to a plantation 
farther south, and Tubman never shook her own fears of a similar fate. She almost 
died at the age of 14 from a severe head injury when an overseer threw a 2-pound 
weight at another slave but hit Tubman instead. In 1844, she married John Tubman, 
a free black who lived nearby. (Marriages of slaves and free blacks were uncommon, 
but not unknown.) Th e free husband thought his wife worried too much about being 
a slave. In 1849, Tubman made her way north to Philadelphia without her husband 
or other help and found work as a domestic. She recalled, “I was free; but there was 
no one to welcome me to the land of freedom.” Everyone she knew and cared for 
was “down in the old cabin quarters, with the old folks and my brothers and sisters.” 
On December 22, 1848, the following advertisement 
appeared in the Baltimore Sun : 
FIFTY DOLLARS REWARD—Ran away from the subscriber, 
on the 10 th inst [this month], a MAN named 
Celus, calls himself Celus Dorsey, about 23 years old, 
slender made, about 5 feet, 7 or 8 inches high, dark 
complexion, rather thick lip; he has a large scar on 
one of his hands from a burn. It is probable he is 
lurking about Baltimore. I will give the above reward 
if taken out of the State, and $30 if taken in the State, 
and secured so I get him again. 
SAML C. HUNT, 10 miles from Baltimore, on 
Baltimore and Susquehanna Railroad 
Historians have found hundreds of similar advertisements in 
newspapers in slaveholding states from the American Revolution 
to the middle of the Civil War. Each advertisement tells a small 
part of the story of someone who had the opportunity and 
the courage to run away from slavery and the slaveholder’s 
determination to see him or her returned. 
Source: Baltimore Sun , December 22, 1848. 
Thinking Critically 
1. Contextualization 
What does Hunt’s location tell us? What opportunity would 
a slave living further from a city have to run away? Why 
might Hunt have thought that Dorsey was “lurking around 
Baltimore”? Was there something about a city, even in a 
slaveholding state, that might attract a slave? 
2. Historical Interpretation 
Why were slaveholders so willing to advertise about runaway 
slaves and let others know that enslaved people were 
running away as often as the advertisements imply? What 
might be lost and what might be gained for a slave owner by 
posting such advertisements?

Tubman decided that the best solution was to bring the rest of her family to freedom, 
though she never rejoined her free husband. 
Having successfully brought most of her family north, Tubman developed a 
pattern that she would continue until the Civil War. She worked for a while, raised 
some money, and then made a trip south to free a group of slaves. Between 1850 
and 1861, Tubman made trip after trip, helping slaves escape and taking them 
north. As the full impact of the 1850 Fugitive Slave Law took effect, she did not 
stop in Pennsylvania but accompanied each group to Canada. As Tubman’s fame 
grew, it earned her the support of Northern abolitionists and the hatred of many 
slaveholders. The reward for her capture grew steadily, but she kept returning 
south to free more people. Northern abolitionists supported her work, and in 1859, 
the Unitarian minister Th omas Wentworth Higginson took up a collection at the 
Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society so that Tubman could “resume the practice of 
her profession!” 
REBELS AND SLAVE REVOLTS Although slaveholders typically claimed that their 
slaves were happy and content, the number of slaves who ran away undermined 
those claims. On some level, slaveholders were aware of the reality because, as much 
as they sought to catch runaway slaves, they most intensely feared the possibility 
of a slave revolt. Slave revolts were relatively rare, but they did happen. Historians 
have documented over 200 slave revolts in the United States in the 60 years before 
the Civil War. Some were little more than small-scale events on a single plantation; 
others were much larger. On August 30, 1800, Gabriel Prosser led over 1,000 slaves 
in a planned attack on Richmond, Virginia (see Chapter 7 ) . In 1810, plans for a 
revolt were discovered in Lexington, Kentucky. In 1811, 400 slaves revolted in New 
Orleans. And in 1815, a white man named George Boxley attempted to lead a slave 
revolt in Virginia. 
In 1822, Denmark Vesey and his supporters planned to burn the military and 
fi nancial center of Charleston, South Carolina, murder the white residents, and then 
seize the city’s caches of weapons and gold. Th ey would then set sail for a new life 
of freedom in Haiti. Vesey, who had purchased his own freedom 
in 1800, had been plotting his revolt for years. He led a Bible class 
in Charlestown for the African Methodist Episcopal Church, and he 
spoke of the biblical stories of moving from slavery to freedom with 
the passion of a latter-day Moses. He also spoke fl uent French and 
was clearly infl uenced by the success of the Haitian slave revolt. No 
one really knows how close Vesey came to success before his plot was 
betrayed. Some estimated that his co-conspirators numbered in the 
thousands, making it one of the largest slave revolts. In stories whispered 
behind closed doors, Vesey and his followers represented the 
ultimate terror to the white community. 
In 1831, Nat Turner led a revolt that was more successful than 
Vesey’s. Terror spread throughout the South when Turner’s forces 
killed over 60 slave-owning whites before the revolt was defeated by 
state and federal troops. Over 100 slaves were killed in the fi ghting or 
executed aft er capture. Turner himself was captured and interviewed 
by his white, court-appointed attorney, Th omas Gray, before he was 
executed. Gray subsequently published an account of the conversation 
as Th e Confessions of Nat Turner . 
Turner reported having been a religious man from his earliest 
years. His prayers and meditations convinced him of three 
things: “that I was ordained for some great purpose in the hands 
of the Almighty,” that the Almighty’s purpose included freedom 
for American slaves, and that “the great day of judgment was at 
hand.”

12.3 
In the aft ermath of the Turner revolt, Southern fears increased, and repressive 
laws were passed across the South, including laws making it illegal to teach a slave 
to read and write to prevent others like Turner from studying the Bible and other 
information on their own. In the slave quarters, however, Turner became a legend, 
and stories of his exploits were told and retold. Despite the consequences, the 
revolts continued. 
Some Northern blacks also called for slave uprisings. David Walker, who was 
born free in Ohio, published his Appeal to the Colored Citizens of the World in Boston 
in 1829. Walker’s goal was “To awaken in the breasts of my affl icted, degraded and 
slumbering brethren, a spirit of inquiry and investigation respecting our miseries 
and wretchedness in this Republican Land of Liberty!!!!!!” Walker also asked white 
Americans, will God “let the oppressors rest comfortably and happy always?” But the 
primary audience for Walker’s Appeal was among his fellow African-Americans to 
whom he said, “Th e whites want slaves, and want us for their slaves, but some of them 
will curse the day they ever saw us.” 
In his 1843 “Address to the Slaves of the United States of America,” Henry 
Highland Garnet also did not mince words. He said to the slaves of the South, 
Brethren, arise, arise! Strike for your lives and liberties. Now is the day and the 
hour.…Let your motto be resistance! Resistance! RESISTANCE! 
For Garnet and Walker, the time was long past for aiding individual escapes or 
agitating for a constitutional end to slavery; they were ready for direct action. 
White Abolitionists 
In the fi rst issue of his newspaper Th e Liberator , published in 1831, William Lloyd 
Garrison declared, “I am in earnest—I will not equivocate—I will not excuse—I will 
not retreat a single inch. –AND I WILL BE HEARD.” Over the next 35 years until the 
passage of the Th irteenth Amendment ending slavery in the United States in 1865, 
Garrison never backed down. He was a loner who alienated most people who tried 
to work with him. Nevertheless, in 1833 he was one of the key members in launching 
the American Anti-Slavery Society in Boston, which, like Th e Liberator , was 
committed to the total abolition of slavery everywhere in the United States, and for 
a third of a century, he kept the issue of slavery in front of a white society that oft en 
did not want to hear about it. Garrison’s role in the abolitionist movement can hardly 
be overstated. 
In the 1830s, Garrison was already a believer in the “free labor” doctrine that the 
Republican Party would adopt in the 1850s. He contrasted Northern free labor, which 
provided opportunities for anyone to gain the economic independence so important 
to freedom, and Southern slavery, which created a rigid hierarchy of wealthy elites, 
poor whites, and enslaved blacks. 
Garrison was not a church member, but he modeled himself on the image of an 
Old Testament prophet, and he saw the considerable abuse that was heaped on him 
over many years as proof of his own righteousness. Other abolitionists, white and 
black, also were subject to considerable abuse. In 1835, Garrison himself was almost 
lynched in Boston. In New York City, Lewis and Arthur Tappan, highly successful 
merchants, were also shunned for their abolitionist activity. And in Alton, Illinois, on 
the Mississippi River opposite the slaveholding state of Missouri, Elijah Lovejoy was 
killed by a mob in 1837 aft er he had set up a small printing press to publish antislavery 
literature. Despite his status as a loner, Garrison did befriend other abolitionists and 
runaway slaves. He helped launch Frederick Douglass on his remarkable career as an 
abolitionist leader, though the two diff ered on many issues. 
On the fourth of July in 1854, at a sunny aft ernoon picnic of the Massachusetts 
Anti-Slavery Society in Framingham, Massachusetts, Garrison burned a copy of the

hated Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 that required all citizens to help return 
escaped slaves to those who claimed them. As it burned, Garrison 
shouted, “And let all the people say, ‘Amen.’” It was not a surprising action 
at an antislavery rally, but when the crowd roared its response, Garrison 
also held up a copy of the United States Constitution—a sacred document 
to many—and called it “the source and parent of the other atrocities” 
because of its clauses that protected slavery and set it on fi re, too. And 
again the crowd responded to his call for an “Amen.” For all his radicalism, 
Garrison was also a pacifi st. He always insisted that his goal was “to 
accomplish the great work of national redemption through the agency of 
moral power,” not force. While he argued that events like Nat Turner’s 
bloody rebellion were inevitable, he could never condone violence, even 
the violence of the Civil War, to end slavery. 
Garrison may have crusaded independently, but many other white 
Americans were joining forces as abolitionists in the 1830s and 1840s, 
and especially aft er the passage of the Fugitive Slave Act in 1850. What 
came to be known as “Oberlin abolitionism” emerged from the revivals 
that Charles Grandison Finney led in upstate New York in the 1820s. 
In May 1836, the American Anti-Slavery Society began a campaign 
to evangelize the nation for abolitionism. What was needed, the society’s 
leaders decided, were antislavery revivalists who modeled their 
activities on the work of religious revivalists. Funds would be raised to 
send out at least 70 organizers to preach the sin of slavery and the need 
for the repentance of abolitionism. Th eodore Dwight Weld, who had 
begun his career working with Finney, was commissioned to choose 
the agents. 
Weld turned to his old classmates from theology school, especially now that many 
of them were seeking their first appointments as ministers. Eventually, 30 of the 
54 students who had been part of Weld’s class at Lane Seminary in the early 1830s 
became antislavery agents. Th ey carried revivalism and activism to all the free states of 
the union. 
In the 1840s and 1850s, 12 to 15 percent of all Americans were slaves like Susan 
Merritt or former slaves like John Taper. Most Americans held some opinion about 
the condition of slaves, and increasingly, activists on both sides of the issue were 
taking strong stands. Some, including Edmund Ruffi n, were defenders of slavery; 
others such as William Lloyd Garrison, David Walker, and Sarah Grimké were its 
opponents. But almost no Americans were completely free of economic ties to slavery 
or were able to ignore its impact on American culture and politics. Slaves produced 
cotton, which clothed most Americans and fueled the nation’s economy. By the 
1850s, the issue of slavery also dominated American politics. Whatever one’s place 
in society and one’s point of view, slavery was a central issue and topic of debate. 
It would not go away.

NEW STRENGTH FOR AMERICAN WOMEN 
Describe how the women’s rights movement developed in the United States in the 
1830s and 1840s. 
On July 20, 1848, 68 women and 32 men signed a Declaration of Sentiments 
and Resolutions at the end of their 2-day meeting in Seneca Falls, New York. The 
document—which followed the form of the Declaration of Independence—is oft en 
viewed as the opening statement of the women’s rights movement in the United States. 
Th is declaration stated, 
We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men and women are created 
equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; 
that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. 
Then, just as Jefferson listed grievances against George III, those who gathered in 
upstate New York offered their grievances against the male-dominated culture in 
which they lived. Th eir document made history and achieved far more recognition 
than its authors ever imagined. But the Seneca Falls convention would likely not 
have happened without the work of others who began to question women’s roles in 
the decades before the convention, and the work of the those at the convention still 
depended on the continued eff orts of supporters to fi ght for change. 
New Ideas about Women’s Rights 
The 1848 convention of women at Seneca Falls was not the first time women in the 
United States began to lobby for their rights. Although hardly a feminist in today’s terms, 
Abigail Adams had reminded her husband, John, that the framers of a new government 
in 1776 should “remember the ladies.” In 1838, the abolitionist and feminist Sarah 
Grimké published Letters on the Equality of the Sexes and the Condition of Women , portions 
of which she fi rst published in Garrison’s Th e Liberator and which she originally 
addressed to the Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society. In the 1838 book she argued that 
in the present “condition of women in my own country,” well-off women were “taught to 
regard marriage as the one thing needful, the only avenue to distinction,” while “in those 
employments which are peculiar to women, their time is estimated at only half the value 
of that of men.” Grimké also argued that men suff ered from the assumption that they 
alone needed to support families while she believed they would ultimately fi nd greater 
happiness in seeing women “as their equal” even if that view did not come easily to them. 
Few women symbolized the strong links between feminism and abolitionism as 
did Sarah and Angelina Grimké, sisters from South Carolina. Born to a prosperous 
South Carolina slaveholding family, both women broke with their family over the 
issue of slavery. By 1836, the sisters had become the fi rst female representatives of 
the American Anti-Slavery Society, based in New York City. Th ey had also become 
ardent feminists. In 1838, Angelina married another abolitionist, Th eodore Dwight 
Weld. For most of the rest of their lives, Weld and the two sisters lived together and 
campaigned to end slavery, racism, and sexism in society. 
Sarah Grimké wrote Letters on the Equality of the Sexes aft er she and her sister 
were criticized for giving public lectures on the antislavery cause. Th e ministers and 
others who criticized the sisters might have been sympathetic to the women’s antislavery 
views, but they thought women had no place speaking in public to a group that 
included women and men. Sarah had no intention of backing down on either topic. 
She began her Letters , “Here I plant myself. God created us equal:” Th en, focusing on 
women’s rights, she continued: 
All history attests that man has subjected woman to his will, used her as a 
means to promote his selfish gratification, to minister to his sensual pleasures, 
to be instrumental in promoting his comfort; but never has he desired

to elevate her to that rank she was created to fi ll. He has done all he could to 
debase and enslave her mind; and now he looks triumphantly on the ruin he 
has wrought, and says, the being he has thus deeply injured is his inferior…. 
To me it is perfectly clear that WHATEVER IT IS MORALLY RIGHT FOR A 
MAN TO DO, IT IS MORALLY RIGHT FOR A WOMAN TO DO. . . she is 
clothed by her Maker with the same rights , and…the same duties . 
Grimké’s Letters were in circulation a decade before the meeting at Seneca Falls, but 
that gathering brought the cause of women’s rights to a much larger audience. Because 
it brought together such powerful women as Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucretia Mott, 
and many others—soon joined by others including Susan B. Anthony and Matilda 
Gage—Seneca Falls provided the foundation for a half-century long campaign for 
women’s rights and specifi cally women’s suff rage. 
The Seneca Falls Convention Shapes a Movement 
Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott were the organizers of the 1848 Seneca 
Falls Women's Rights Convention that brought the cause of women’s rights to the 
attention of many. Stanton and her family had come to rural Seneca Falls, New York, 
only the previous year. Th ey missed life in their former home in Boston but thought 
Seneca Falls would provide a rest. However, Elizabeth found life in Seneca Falls diffi 
cult and lonely. 
In the summer of 1848, Lucretia Mott, already a well-known Quaker abolitionist 
and reformer, and her husband James were visiting Seneca Falls as part of a trip to 
the nearby Seneca Indian tribe and to former slaves now living as free people across 
the border in Canada. Stanton visited Mott and poured out her frustration. Mott had 
similar grievances. Both women had long been active in the antislavery cause. Henry 
B. Stanton, Elizabeth’s husband, was a well-known abolitionist, and he and Elizabeth 
had traveled widely in the service of the cause. Stanton and Mott had both attended 
the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London in 1840 with their husbands. At that 
gathering, all of the women were excluded from any speaking role. As they talked 
about it in 1848, Stanton and Mott decided, “then and there, to call a ‘Woman’s Rights 
Convention’” for the following week. 
Th e Woman’s Rights Convention at Seneca Falls generated far more attention— 
most of it negative—than the organizers expected. Stanton remembered, “All the journals 
from Maine to Texas seemed to strive with each other to see which could make 
our movement appear most ridiculous.” Looking back on the hostility that the convention 
generated, Stanton said, “If I had had the slightest premonition of all that was 
to follow that convention, I fear I should not have had the courage to risk it.” 
Not all the responses were hostile, however. Th e abolitionist Frederick Douglass 
attended the Seneca Falls gathering and spoke in favor of, and signed, the declaration. 
Abolitionists were used to hostility, and much of the abolitionist press supported 
the Seneca Falls statement, launching an important alliance between abolitionists and 
advocates for women’s rights. Stanton, Mott, and many like them were abolitionists 
fi rst who then added women’s rights to their concerns, in part, because of their exclusion 
from leadership positions in the abolitionist movements and, in part, because 
they saw the rights of enslaved people and new freedoms for women as part of the 
same reform eff ort. Douglass and many male abolitionists were also among the strongest 
supporters of women’s rights. And many of the most determined opponents of 
one movement also opposed the other. 
Reports of the Woman’s Rights Convention at Seneca Falls caught the attention 
of other women and subsequent conventions were held across New York state and in 
Massachusetts, Ohio, Indiana, and Pennsylvania. Among those who heard the news of 
the Seneca Falls convention were Susan B. Anthony and Matilda Joslyn Gage. Anthony 
was a teacher in Rochester, New York, and active in temperance and antislavery reforms.

Gage gave birth to a son just before the Seneca Falls meeting and could 
not attend. Both of these women quickly became friends with Stanton and 
fellow leaders of the women’s rights movement for over half a century. 
Th ey also joined as editors of the fi rst three volumes of History of Woman 
Suff rage published between 1881 and 1886. Th e gathering at Seneca Falls, 
the declaration that the convention issued, and the movement that followed 
became far more than the small band of organizers dared hope for 
when they gathered on those hot summer days. 
A Growing Women’s Rights Movement 
Women continued to lead campaigns to open other doors to women 
during the years aft er the convention at Seneca Falls. Some collaborated 
with the Seneca Falls leaders and some worked on their own. 
When Lucy Stone graduated from Oberlin College in 1847—Oberlin 
and Antioch were among the fi rst American colleges to admit women 
as students—she was chosen as the commencement speaker but was 
told that a man would have to read her speech because it was not 
appropriate for women to speak to mixed audiences. In response, she 
refused to write one. In 1855, when she married Henry B. Blackwell, 
Stone insisted on keeping her own name, a huge break with tradition. 
Stone’s Oberlin friend and sister-in-law Antoinette Brown Blackwell 
was the first woman ordained as a Protestant minister in 1851. In 
1849, Elizabeth Blackwell, sister-in-law to both women, became the 
fi rst woman awarded an M.D. degree. 
Another reformer, Amelia Bloomer, who had participated in 
the Seneca Falls convention and served as a temperance lecturer, 
embraced a diff erent kind of freedom for women when in 1851 she 
popularized a kind of trousers that women might wear instead of 
the cumbersome hoop skirts that were expected of all middle-class 
women. 
Other women demanded other kinds of rights. One of the most 
important issues for many women was the right to control their own 
property. In nearly all the states before the 1830s, a married woman’s 
husband controlled all of the couple’s property. Women fought such 
rules, and aft er the Panic of 1837, in which many women saw their life savings disappear 
because of a husband’s bankruptcy, their voices began to be heard. Mississippi 
was the fi rst state to pass laws specifi cally allowing women to keep the property they 
brought into their marriages. Th e 1839 law said that property that women had before 
a marriage or inherited during a marriage—including slaves—could not be controlled 
by their husbands. Michigan passed a law in 1844 that protected a women’s property 
from a husband’s creditors, and in the 1840s and 1850s, other states followed. In Texas 
and other states that had once belonged to Mexico, Spanish-era laws had long given 
women the rights to control their own property, and those rights were incorporated 
into the new American legal systems. 
In the 1830s, other women formed antiprostitution societies to protect women 
from being forced into such work. Additional reformers of the 1830s became advocates 
for dietary reform, including Mary Gove Nichols, who along with Sylvester 
Graham (of Graham crackers) advocated a healthier diet free of alcohol, coff ee, 
meat, sugar, and spices. 
Advocates for the rights of women also had their diff erences with one another. 
Some of the most intense diff erences came over the issue of divorce. Frances (Fanny) 
Wright, who had been infl uenced by Robert Owen’s ideas about an ideal community 
(see Chapter 10 ) , represented an extreme view of the topic. Wright tried to create her

Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony became lifelong friends 
soon after the Woman’s Rights Convention at Seneca Falls and, in 
spite of occasional disagreements, worked together for almost half a 
century to fi ght for women’s right to vote.

own utopian community at Nashoba, Tennessee, where she advocated 
that the best way to end slavery and the racial prejudice that 
maintained it was to promote interracial unions that would produce 
a new breed of Americans. Even aft er the failure of Nashoba, 
Wright continued to argue that the institution of marriage was 
a barrier to women’s equality. More moderate women, including 
Elizabeth Cady Stanton, argued that marriage was a simple legal 
contract, not a sacred institution, and that at least in the case of a 
husband who was a drunkard or abusive, divorce should be easy. 
Others disagreed, not only those hostile to women’s rights but 
also leaders of the women’s movement such as Antoinette Brown 
Blackwell. 
Th e links between the women’s rights and antislavery eff orts, 
important as they were, were not without their tensions. Some 
African-American women felt those tensions especially deeply. As 
early as 1832, the fi rst female antislavery society in the United States 
was created by African-American women in Salem, Massachusetts. 
White women soon followed with their own societies in a number 
of large cities, but black women were often reluctant to join the 
integrated societies in which white women nearly always claimed 
all of the leadership roles. At a women’s rights convention in 
Akron, Ohio, in 1851, Sojourner Truth asked, “May I say a few 
words?” Truth was already a nationally recognized fi gure. She had 
been born a slave in New York State in 1799 but was freed by the 
New York Emancipation Act of 1827. She took the name Sojourner 
Truth and traveled across the nation demanding freedom for her 
fellow Americans of African origin. She told the convention: 
I have as much muscle as any man, and can do as much work 
as any man. I have plowed and reaped and husked and chopped 
and mowed, and can any man do more than that? I have heard 
much about the sexes being equal. I can carry as much as any 
man, and can eat as much too, if I can get it. I am as strong as 
any man.…But man is in a tight place, the poor slave is on him, 
woman is coming on him, he is surely between a hawk and a 
buzzard. 
Versions of the speech published later added the famous refrain “And ain’t I a 
woman?” In that speech, Truth linked the antislavery and women’s rights campaigns, 
telling those who opposed that link that they would indeed be caught “between a hawk 
and a buzzard” if she had anything to do with it.

Quick Review What did the women’s and abolitionist movements have in common? 
How did the two movements build on each other? 
CONCLUSION 
In the decades leading up to the Civil War, the United States grew in area and in population. 
From 1830 to 1850, the number of people living in the United States almost 
doubled, from fewer than 13 million to more than 23 million. Rising birth rates among 
native-born Americans fueled the largest proportion of this growth, but other forces also 
sent U.S. population statistics upward. Immigrants, particularly from China, Ireland, 
and Germany, contributed to the rise as did the multitudes of new residents acquired 
when the United States gained new territory aft er its war with Mexico. Responding to 
a variety of push-and-pull factors, immigrants fl ocked to America to escape hardships 
The “bloomers” that Amelia Bloomer popularized were much more than a 
fashion statement. They essentially meant that women could wear pants, 
liberating them from the long hoop skirts that were virtually required wear 
for middle-class women and that made any sort of activity, from walking 
upstairs to physical activity out of doors, extremely diffi cult.

at home and to pursue economic opportunity on American soil as domestics, farmers, 
miners, railroad workers, builders, and factory laborers. In many cases, native-born 
Americans did not take well to immigrants, seeing them as a threat to their own jobs 
and quality of life. Th e country’s growing diversity brought new tensions. 
Large territorial gains, ceded to the United States under the terms of the Treaty 
of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848 and purchased from Mexico by U.S. diplomat James 
Gadsden in 1853, stretched the nation’s borders farther south and west, bringing 
many Spanish-speaking people, as well as Plains and Pueblo Indians, into the 
country. Although the treaties had promised that these residents would be respected 
and allowed to continue living in the areas, Americans who fl ocked into those regions 
generally pushed out those who were already there, leaving them in much more 
marginal positions. 
Changes in fashion, technology, and transportation led to cotton’s becoming 
a highly profi table crop in the 19th century, more profi table with each succeeding 
decade. Its cultivation spread across the lower South, transforming the Southern 
economy and the dynamics of slavery. Th e slave population also surged during this 
time, increasing from 1.5 million to 4 million between 1820 and 1860. By 1840, the 
American South was the leading producer of cotton in the world, and plantation 
owners, eager to exploit the rising demand for the crop, moved slaves into new 
cotton-growing regions to work in the fi elds from dawn to dusk. Th is new cotton 
economy made slavery in the South far more profi table than ever before. Slave owners 
justifi ed the institution of slavery as a “positive good” wherein slaves were thought 
to be better off being provided for on plantations than left to fend for themselves. 
Slaves, through open revolt, escape, and other less dramatic means, resisted their 
enslavement. Abolitionists in the North—white and black—also resisted slavery, 
campaigning against the institution with renewed vehemence that heightened sectional 
tensions. 
Women, who were also struggling for full rights as citizens, launched a suff rage 
movement at Seneca Falls, New York, in 1848 and a campaign for full rights in all 
areas of society. Many women and some men saw a link between freedom from slavery 
and the emancipation of women, and they agitated tirelessly for both causes, even 
though others of both sexes renounced their eff orts. 
Which changes in the United States had the greatest impact on emerging social 
movements in the 1840s and 1850s? You may want to consider immigration, the 
growth of both antislavery and proslavery propaganda, and the campaign for 
equal rights for women in your answer.

Chapter 12 Summary and Review 
THE CHANGING FACE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IN THE 
1840s AND 1850s 
12.1 
Analyze how immigration from China, Ireland, and Germany, as 
well as the incorporation of Mexican citizens in the Southwest, 
changed the United States. 
Summary 
Americans in Hawaii and California saw Chinese laborers 
as a key to solving a shortage of workers. Most Chinese 
immigrants were men, and most intended to return to China. 
Chinese gold miners faced growing resistance from white 
miners. As the gold fields became less productive, many 
Chinese workers went to work building the railroads. Famine 
in Ireland in the late 1840s led to a new wave of Irish immigration. 
Irish laborers played a key role in the construction 
and growth of America’s cities. Th e rapid growth of America’s 
Irish and German population frightened many native-born 
Americans, particularly because the Irish and some of the 
Germans had a strong Catholic heritage, because many immigrants 
were poor, and because important cultural diff erences 
among the Irish and Germans immigrants were unfamiliar. 
In California, the Mexican community was deeply divided 
between a small elite who were initially sympathetic to the 
United States and a larger but marginalized number of poor 
people. Th e Californios, as this elite was called, soon found 
their hopes for power in the new California dashed. A similar 
fate befell the Tejano elite in Texas. Th e Mexican or Hispano 
elite that controlled New Mexico fared better than their counterparts, 
in large part because American newcomers remained 
a minority in New Mexico throughout the 19th century. For 
many poor people in the Southwest, the transfer of authority 
from Mexico to the United States meant increased poverty 
and far less opportunity for justice.

SLAVERY IN THE UNITED STATES, 1840s AND 1850s 
12.2 
Explain how the lives of slaves, slaveholders, and abolitionists 
evolved in the decades before the Civil War. 
Summary 
Th e way the institution of slavery operated changed signifi cantly 
over time and especially after 1820. New lands, technological 
innovations, and the use of slave labor allowed the South 
to develop a kind of industrialized agriculture that produced 
60 percent of the world’s cotton. Th e growth of this cotton industry 
led to the transfer of slaves out of the upper South and into the 
lower South. Th is process proved enormously painful and disruptive 
for the slaves involved. As profi ts—and criticism—increased, 
slave owners began to defend the institution as a positive good, 
based in part on comparisons to the conditions of Northern 
workers and in part on arguments about black inferiority. Th e 
increasing value of slaves led to marginal improvements in their 
material conditions. Slaves did all they could to build families 
and communities within the confi nes of slavery. Most runaway 
slaves were caught and punished, but some made it to the 
North. Runaway slaves, most notably Frederick Douglass, were 
among the greatest abolitionist leaders. Harriet Tubman, another 
escaped slave, became one of the most successful conductors on 
the Underground Railroad. The most frightening thing slaveholders 
could imagine was a slave revolt. Denmark Vesey’s 1822 
conspiracy terrifi ed white Southerners. In the aft ermath of Nat 
Turner’s 1831 revolt, Southern fears increased and repressive laws 
were passed across the South. White abolitionism intensifi ed in 
the 1830s and 1840s. William Lloyd Garrison played a crucial 
role in shaping the movement. Evangelical Christians also played 
an important part.

Chapter 13 The Politics of Separation 383 
While thousands of Americans, along with Asians and Europeans, 
were pouring into California in search of gold, other Americans 
were attacking or defending slavery. These two seemingly 
separate issues came to a head in Congress in 1850. Because of its rapid goldrush-
inspired growth, President Taylor advocated statehood for California 
from the time that he took offi ce in 1848, and in 1849, Californians adopted 
a state constitution and applied for statehood only 1 year aft er the United 
States acquired it from Mexico. The territory far exceeded the minimum 
population threshold for statehood, but there was a problem: although the 
admission of California as a free state would once again restore the carefully 
craft ed balance of free and slave states, evening out the numbers aft er 
the balance in the Senate had been disrupted by admitting Texas as a slave 
state, other future free states might follow, which threatened those in the 
South. Contrary to some expectations, the U.S. War with Mexico had not 
produced another slave state for the Union aft er Texas. Admitting California 
as a free state would restore the balance in the Senate that had been the rule 
since the Missouri Compromise of 1820 and that the admission of Texas had 
disrupted in 1846, leading to 15 slaves states represented, but only 14 free 
states. Many in the North and South thought a balance was essential to 
maintaining the Union. But Southern senators, both Whig and Democrat, 
agreed that if California were admitted as a free state, then other free states

about permanently to destroy the balance of power between the sections.” Th e South’s 
ill and aging champion John C. Calhoun wrote in his diary, “As things now stand, the 
South cannot with safety remain in the Union.” Much had happened to lead Davis 
and Calhoun to their conclusions. In the 1850s, more Southerners would come to 
believe that they could not remain in the Union, and hostility to the South and its 
“ peculiar institution” of slavery would increase in the North. Although a new generation 
in Congress tried again to enact the kinds of compromises that had held the 
country together since the adoption of the Constitution in 1789, those eff orts no longer 
worked. Th e tensions that led Southern states to feel compelled to secede from the 
United States in 1861 are the focus of this chapter. 
FROM UNION TO DISUNION 
Analyze the political jockeying in Congress and how reaction to the Fugitive Slave Act 
and the publication of Uncle Tom’s Cabin, changed the opinions of many Americans— 
South and the North—making a break between them hard to avoid. 
The Congress that met in 1849 and 1850 and debated whether and how to admit 
California was one of the most contentious ever seated. Th e same three men, Daniel 
Webster of Massachusetts, John C. Calhoun of South Carolina, and Henry Clay of 
Kentucky, who had dominated the Senate as young men in 1820 now, as old men, 
played the central role in 1850. Th e dramatic debates of 1850 would be the last time the 
three would appear on the Senate fl oor. A new generation of senators would also play 
crucial roles in the coming years: Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois (who would contest 
the presidency with Abraham Lincoln in 1860), William H. Seward of New York and 
Salmon P. Chase of Ohio (who would both seek the Republican nomination for president 
in 1860 and then serve in Lincoln’s Cabinet), and Jeff erson Davis of Mississippi 
(who would be elected president of the Confederacy in 1861). 
Proslavery senators like Calhoun and Davis were worried about California, but 
they were even more worried about abolitionism in the North, which had been a 
growing force since the 1840s. Th roughout the 1840s and 1850s there were many different 
kinds of abolitionists with diff ering levels of commitment to their cause, but 
Southerners tended to view all abolitionists as extremists. At the core of the movement 
were those known as the radical abolitionists for whom slavery was the greatest evil in 
the nation, an evil that needed to end immediately and completely. A larger group of 
Northerners were sympathetic with the radicals, but not willing to move as quickly or 
do as much to oppose slavery. Many of these moderates fell into the free-soil category, 
willing to let slavery stay where it already existed but adamantly opposing any extension 
of slavery to new territories where it did not yet exist by law. Finally, there were 
others for whom ending slavery was perhaps a good thing but not the highest priority. 
All of these Northerners, however, were committed to “free labor,” the belief that 
slavery undermined the value and dignity of hard work and that many white people 
were also marginalized in places were slave labor was predominant. In the 1850s, this 
sentiment would lead voters in the new Republican Party to cheer for “Free Soil, Free 
Speech, Free Labor, and Free Men.” 
Many of the tensions that exploded in Congress in 1850 dated to the U.S. War 
with Mexico in the 1840s. In 1846, Democratic Congressman David Wilmot of 
Pennsylvania proposed an amendment to a military appropriations bill, prohibiting 
slavery in any territory acquired from Mexico. Th is so-called Wilmot Proviso sprang 
from growing anger among Northern Democrats at what they saw as the pro-Southern 
tilt of the Polk administration. With support from northern Whigs, the amendment

passed the House, but died in the Senate where Southern Senators were able to block 
all such measures in 1846 and 1847. A Boston newspaper said of the Proviso, “As if 
by magic, it brought to a head the great question that is about to divide the American 
people.” By 1850, the question of slavery created divisions that cut across party lines, 
whether Democrat or Whig. 
California, the Compromise of 1850, and the Fugitive Slave Act 
A new Congress, elected just aft er the end of the War with Mexico, and a new president, 
war-hero Zachery Taylor, tackled the complex question of California’s statehood. Taylor 
was a political unknown. Southerners tended to trust him because he owned slaves and 
a Louisiana plantation, but 40 years as an offi cer in the U.S. Army had led Taylor to 
value the Union. He hated the threat of secession. In 1849, Taylor proposed admitting 
not only California but New Mexico as new states. California would certainly be a 
free state, but Taylor’s proposal left the future status of New Mexico uncertain, though 
there were virtually no slaves there. By the time Congress convened in December 1849, 
much of the country was in an uproar, with many in the South threatening secession if 
two free states were admitted and many in the North willing to call their bluff . 
In that charged situation, Senator Henry Clay of Kentucky, long known as the 
“Great Compromiser” for his role in craft ing the Compromise of 1820, tried again. 
Clay off ered a series of proposals that he hoped would pass Congress and avert a sectional 
crisis by defusing tension in a number of areas. Th e fi rst compromise would 
admit California as a state but organize New Mexico under a territorial government 
with no “restriction or condition on the subject of slavery.” As a territory, New Mexico 
would have no votes in the Senate, a key concern of slaveholders in Congress since 
they were certain—probably rightly—that New Mexico would opt to enter the union 
as a free state. Th e second compromise Clay proposed would resolve the contested 
question of the Texas–New Mexico border by giving more land to New Mexico and 
giving Texas $10 million to pay off the debts of the former Republic of Texas. Since 
many Southerners held Republic of Texas bonds, this proposal had great appeal in the 
South. Th e third proposal abolished the slave trade but not slavery itself in the District 
of Columbia. Finally, to ensure Southern support, Clay proposed a fourth compromise: 
a law enhancing slaveholders’ right to reclaim slaves who fl ed north. Th e whole 
package may have seemed to Clay like a careful balance that would appeal to both sections. 
In fact, most members of Congress from each section disliked it, claiming that it 
did not go nearly far enough in the direction they wanted. 
In the debate that followed Clay’s proposals, John C. Calhoun warned that if 
California were admitted as a free state, it would “destroy irretrievably the equilibrium 
between the two sections,” and that Southerners could not remain in the Union. Th e 
threat of secession was clear. Th ree days later, Daniel Webster spoke in favor of the 
compromise. Webster began, “I wish to speak to-day, not as a Massachusetts man, 
nor as a Northern man, but as an American.…I speak to-day for the preservation of 
the Union.” It was an impressive speech and one memorized by generations of school 
children. But it virtually destroyed Webster’s reputation in an increasingly abolitionist 
Massachusetts where many of his constituents were no longer willing to compromise 
with slaveholders. 
In the long hot summer of 1850, fi rst Calhoun and then President Taylor both 
died in offi ce. Th e new President Millard Fillmore, from New York, favored compromise, 
perhaps more than Taylor had. In addition, a new generation of senators, of 
whom Stephen A. Douglas was the leader, managed to forge a fi nal compromise close 
to Clay’s proposal. In a series of separate resolutions, California was admitted as a free 
state; New Mexico and Utah were organized as territories with no votes in Congress, 
thus maintaining the balance in the Senate; the slave trade but not slavery was prohibited 
in the District of Columbia; and Texas happily accepted the $10 million in 
exchange for a less expansive border with New Mexico. Most fatefully, Congress also

passed the Fugitive Slave Act , which was designed to please the South by giving them 
the right not only to reclaim runaway slaves but also to demand federal and local 
Northern help in the process. 
There was great rejoicing in Washington in the fall of 1850 when the package 
passed. President Fillmore called it “a final settlement,” but not everyone agreed. 
A convention of delegates from Southern states condemned the compromise 
and affi rmed the right of secession. In the North, Charles Francis Adams, son and 
grandson of moderately antislavery presidents, called the compromise “the consummation 
of the iniquities of the most disgraceful session of Congress.” Horace Mann, 
the former Massachusetts education leader who had succeeded John Quincy Adams 
as a representative from Massachusetts in the congressional seat that was, because of 
Adams’s long eff orts, considered the abolitionist seat, said that the compromise meant 
the Declaration of Independence applied only to white men. For Northerners, the 
vigorous enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act would soon become intolerable, and 
many Southern leaders became convinced that the abolitionists wanted to end slavery 
not only in the territories but also in the states where it was strong and that the only 
solution was to leave the Union. No one knew what the next decade would hold, but 
the most perceptive among them thought the celebrations of 1850 were premature. 
Enforcing the Fugitive Slave Act 
When Henry Clay proposed a new Fugitive Slave Act as part of the Compromise of 
1850 and Stephen A. Douglas persuaded Congress to adopt it, or when Presidents 
Fillmore (1850–1853) and Franklin Pierce (1853–1857) vigorously enforced that law, 
none of them expected the fi restorm that resulted. Th e core of the new law was not 
new. Th e Constitution said 
No person held to service or labor (i.e., a slave) in one State under the laws 
thereof, escaping into another, shall in consequence of any law or regulation 
therein, be discharged from such service or labor, but shall be delivered up on 
claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due. 
Fugitive Slave Act 
A law that was part of the Compromise of 
1850. It created a new set of federal agents 
to help track runaway slaves and required 
authorities in the North to assist Southern 
slave catchers and return runaway slaves to 
their owners.

Even though Northern states had passed “personal liberty laws” in the 
1830s that made it harder to recapture a former slave, the Supreme 
Court in 1842 had affi rmed that slaveholders had a constitutional right 
to capture slaves who had escaped to a free state. Given the number 
of runaway slaves, slave catching was a growth industry in the United 
States before 1850. 
Nevertheless, the new Fugitive Slave Act went much further than 
any previous law. It created a new corps of federal agents to help capture 
runaway slaves. Court-appointed federal commissioners would 
determine whether a person claimed by a slave catcher was truly a 
slave or actually a free person. Commissioners were paid a double fee 
every time they found that a person was a fugitive slave as opposed to 
a free person, and there was no appeal from their decisions. Finally, 
the law provided for a $1,000 fi ne and up to a year in jail for anyone 
who helped a fugitive slave. Across the North, free blacks were worried, 
and many, knowing that it would be difficult to prove that they had 
been born free, moved to Canada before trouble arrived. But the slave 
catchers, now supported by federal agents, fanned out across the North, 
seeking escaped slaves, and in town aft er town, people saw the results. 
It was an ugly spectacle. 
Anthony Burns escaped from slavery in Virginia, went to Boston, 
and found work in a clothing store. But his former owner discovered 
his whereabouts, and under the Fugitive Slave Act, a federal marshal 
arrested Burns on May 24, 1854. Bostonians were incensed. White and 
black abolitionists attacked the courthouse where Burns was held, and 
a federal marshal was killed in the melee. President Pierce ordered 
marines, cavalry, and artillery to Boston to ensure that the Fugitive 
Slave Act was enforced. On June 2, 1854, federal troops marched Burns 
in chains through the streets of Boston to a Coast Guard ship that was 
waiting in Boston harbor to take him back to slavery in Virginia. Huge 
crowds watched the spectacle, church bells tolled, and fl ags fl ew upside 
down. Pierce had upheld the law, but he had lost the respect of many 
of the nation’s citizens. Amos A. Lawrence, one of the richest men in Massachusetts 
and a conservative Whig, was a changed man aft er watching the Burns aff air. He said 
that he and many of his friends “went to bed one night old fashioned, conservative, 
Compromise Union Whigs & waked up stark mad Abolitionists.” Lawrence was far 
from alone. Happily for Burns, his Boston supporters eventually purchased his freedom. 
Nevertheless, the sight of this man being marched by U.S. troops back to slavery 
on the streets of Boston was indelible for many who saw and heard about it. 
Similar incidents happened across the North. In Ohio, Margaret Garner, an escaped 
slave who had crossed the Ohio River from Kentucky, discovered slave catchers at her door, 
and she tried to kill her children rather than allow them to be returned to slavery. One of 
the children died. Garner was sold back to slavery in New Orleans. For Northerners, these 
sorts of events undermined the notion that they were living in free states. Many concluded 
that freedom could not exist in a nation that allowed slavery anywhere. 
Southern defenders of slavery and even their nonslaveholding neighbors were 
similarly coming to the conclusion that slave states and free states could not remain in 
the same country. Th e divisive issue could not be contained by compromise. Federal 
law had banned the international slave trade since 1808, but smugglers found ways to 
fl out that ban and bring new slaves directly from Africa. Northerners likewise fl outed 
the Fugitive Slave Act. When the best known of the Southern slave smugglers, Charles 
A. L. Lamar, was tried in federal court for smuggling slaves into the United States, a 
Southern newspaper asked, “What is the diff erence between a Yankee violating the 
fugitive slave law in the North and a Southern man violating…the law against the 
After enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act became common, abolitionists 
posted warnings to African-Americans that whether born free or escaping 
from slavery, they were no longer safe in Northern cities like Boston.

African slave trade in the South?” In the 1850s, the vigorous enforcement of some 
laws and the fl outing of others angered many Americans, but they diff ered greatly on 
which laws they wanted enforced and which fl outed. 
Uncle Tom's Cabin 
Anger at the Fugitive Slave Act also convinced Harriet Beecher Stowe, already a 
well-known author, to do something for the antislavery cause. As the Fugitive Slave 
Act took eff ect, Stowe wrote “that the time is come when even a woman or a child who 
can speak a word for freedom and humanity is bound to speak.” And speak she did. 
Although she was living in Brunswick, Maine, at the time, Stowe had spent many 
years in Cincinnati, Ohio, and had herself seen slavery directly across the Ohio River 
in Kentucky. Cincinnati—a city that faced the Ohio River and from which one could 
see the slave state of Kentucky on the far shore—was itself home to many fugitives 
from slavery. She began writing what would become Uncle Tom’s Cabin . It was fi rst 
published in serial form in the National Era in 1851 and 1852 and then as a book. 
Within a year, 310,000 copies were in print, making it the bestselling book of the 
century, other than the Bible. What seems to modern readers to be an unrealistic 
and sentimental story of Uncle Tom, the ever-patient and kind slave, his evil owner 
Simon Legree, and heroic Eliza Harris, the slave mother who jumps on ice fl oes in 
Selling 300,000 copies, Uncle Tom’s Cabin was one of the best selling books of the 
century and helped to galvanize Northern opinion against slavery.

the Ohio River to escape pursuing slave catchers, was not only a literary but also a 
political phenomenon in the 1850s and 1860s. If any one book brought home a picture 
of slavery to moderate or ambivalent Northerners it was Uncle Tom’s Cabin . 
Th e book also enraged the South. De Bow’s Southern and Western Review , one of 
the nation’s largest proslavery publications, said the novel was “insulting to the South, 
because Mrs. Stowe wants the world to believe that all she has written is true!” In 
the turmoil of the 1850s, however, the book galvanized antislavery opinion not only 
in the North but also in England where it was credited with playing a role in keeping 
Britain neutral during the Civil War. Th e book angered both Southerners who 
rationalized slavery and Northerners, many of whom fi rst saw the nature of slavery 
through its pages. 
The Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854 
Developments in the early 1850s proved how wrong President Fillmore had been to 
think that the Compromise of 1850 was a “fi nal settlement” of North–South tensions. 
Th e Fillmore administration’s enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act exacerbated antislavery 
opinion across the North and probably cost Fillmore the Whig nomination for 
president. In the 1852 elections, the Whigs, deeply divided between North and South, 
voted on 53 ballots before finally nominating another war hero, General Winfield 
Scott. An almost equally divided Democratic Party nominated Franklin Pierce of New 
Hampshire, whom many in the South considered “as reliable as Calhoun himself ” 
1 
Early in Uncle Tom’s Cabin , Stowe described her heroine Eliza’s 
decision to run away from a Kentucky plantation after hearing 
that her young son was about to be sold away from her and 
the family to a new owner: 
It is impossible to conceive of a human creature 
more wholly desolate and forlorn than Eliza, when 
she turned her footsteps from Uncle Tom’s cabin. 
Her husband’s suffering and dangers, and the danger 
of her child, all blended in her mind, with a confused 
and stunning sense of the risk she was running, in leaving 
the only home she had ever known, and cutting 
loose from the protection of a friend whom she loved 
and revered. Then there was the parting from every 
familiar object.…But stronger than all was maternal 
love, wrought into a paroxysm of frenzy by the near 
approach of a fearful danger. Her boy was old enough 
to have walked by her side, and, in an indifferent case, 
she would only have led him by the hand; but now the 
bare thought of putting him out of her arms made her 
shudder, and she strained him to her bosom with a 
convulsive grasp, as she went rapidly forward.… 
If it were your Harry, mother, or your Willie, that were 
going to be torn from you by a brutal trader, tomorrow 
morning,—if you had seen the man, and heard 
that the papers were signed and delivered, and you 
had only from twelve o’clock till morning to make 
good your escape,—how fast could you walk? 
For many Americans, Eliza’s fear and determination made the 
reality of slavery come alive in ways that decades of antislavery 
publications and true-life stories had not. What a modern reader 
reads as melodrama, readers of the time found compelling.

on the issue of slavery because, they thought, he would win the White House for them 
by sweeping the South. Th e Democrats gamble paid off ; Pierce won and enforced the 
Fugitive Slave Act as actively as Fillmore. 
Despite that highly tense political atmosphere, Senator Stephen A. Douglas of 
Illinois hoped to get federal support for a transcontinental railroad from Chicago 
to the Pacifi c Coast. A railroad did not seem to be something that would immediately 
stir up the tensions swirling around slavery, but it soon did. As one step toward 
organizing the railroad, Douglas and Congressman William A. Richardson, a fellow 
Illinois Democrat, introduced bills into Congress in 1853 that would organize the 
remaining land in the Louisiana Purchase north of the Arkansas River into what they 
called the Nebraska Territory to facilitate awarding a right-of-way for the railroad 
(see Map 13-1 ). 
Southern senators feared an effort to create another free state out of Nebraska 
and blocked the bill. Aft er several failed eff orts at compromise, Douglas proposed to 
split Nebraska into two territories—Nebraska and Kansas—and allow each territory 
to decide whether to allow slavery. He called this approach “ popular sovereignty ”— 
letting each state or territory decide for itself whether to allow or ban slavery in its 
jurisdiction. Others had used the term before him, but Douglas became its most 
prominent proponent. Th e term sounded democratic—as least for white voters—but

Senator Lewis Cass of Michigan by which territorial 
residents, not Congress, would decide

it explicitly repealed the Missouri Compromise of 1820, which banned slavery north 
of Missouri no matter what local residents said. Th e proposal to split the Nebraska 
Territory and allow popular sovereignty to overrule the Missouri Compromise got 
Douglas the support he needed from Southern senators, but it also raised “a hell of 
a storm,” as Douglas knew it would. For many moderates, even for President Pierce, 
the Missouri Compromise had held the Union together for 34 years, almost half the 
nation’s lifetime. Tampering with it seemed dangerous. Douglas was off ering to repeal 
it to be able to organize the new territories that he thought were essential to his plans 
for a railroad. Th e risk was that repealing the Missouri Compromise could allow slavery, 
if the local voters supported it, in territory where it had been banned since 1820. 
While defenders of slavery were delighted, Northern abolitionists and moderates saw 
taking this risk as another step toward spreading slavery throughout the Union, something 
they found unacceptable. 
Northern outrage was intense. The most moderate free-soil advocates who 
opposed extending slavery united with the most radical abolitionists in opposition. 
Five state legislatures and hundreds of meetings and conventions sent petitions to 
Congress declaring, “Th is crime shall not be consummated.” Whig Senator William 
Pitt Fessenden of Maine called the Kansas-Nebraska bill “a terrible outrage.” On the 
other hand, Southerners of both parties strongly supported the Kansas-Nebraska Act . 
In the end, the bill passed in 1854, Pierce signed it, and Douglas got his territory, but 
he also virtually destroyed the Whig Party. 
The Congressional Elections of 1854 and the Birth of the 
Republican Party 
Th e Kansas-Nebraska Act became the defi ning issue in the 1854 elections for Congress. 
Battles between antislavery and proslavery factions within Kansas dominated the 
national news for the next several years. In 1854, northern Whigs, led by Senator 
William H. Seward of New York, along with members of the declining Free Soil Party 
came together to create the Republican Party . Many former Whigs and members 
of smaller parties campaigned for offi ce as Republicans—members of a brand new 
party—in the 1854 congressional elections, and the Republicans, not the Whigs, would 
nominate candidates for president in 1856 and 1860. Southern and proslavery Whigs 
tried to maintain their party for a few years, but what had been a major political party 
in the United States since it was organized to oppose Andrew Jackson disappeared 
during the 1850s. 
In Illinois, a former one-term Whig Congressman, Abraham Lincoln, was 
“aroused…as he had never been before” by the Kansas-Nebraska Act and began 
a campaign for a seat in the U.S. Senate that would allow him to oppose the act on 
the national stage. Stephen A. Douglas, in the middle of his own 6-year term as the 
other senator from Illinois (since all states elect two senators for 6-year terms at 
diff erent times), opposed Lincoln, hoping instead for a fellow Democrat to join him 
in the Senate. Since U.S. Senators were elected by state legislatures at that time, not 
by popular votes, the 1854 senatorial campaign was actually a race among candidates 
for the Illinois legislature, who would then elect the new U.S. Senator. Everyone 
understood that, if the Democrats won a majority of the state legislature, they would 
elect a Democrat to join Douglas, but if the winning majority was the emerging 
Republican Party, supported by the remnants of the Whig Party, they would, many 
expected, elect Lincoln. 
In the fall of 1854, Lincoln and Douglas campaigned throughout the state to 
support the candidates they favored for the Illinois legislature. Lincoln was a moderate, 
far too moderate for many abolitionists, and he remained a Whig throughout the 1854 
campaign, choosing at that time not to join the new Republican Party; however, his 
opposition to the spread of slavery was growing stronger. He argued that while the 
Constitution protected slavery in the states where it existed, it “furnishes no more

excuse for permitting slavery to go into our own free territory, than it would for reviving 
the African slave trade.” When Douglas defended his long-standing policy of “popular 
sovereignty” and the “sacred right of self-government,” Lincoln responded, “when 
the white man governs himself that is self-government; but when he governs himself 
and also governs another man…that is despotism.” Lincoln said that he understood 
that ending slavery where it existed was diffi cult, but he also insisted that there could 
be no moral right for anyone to enslave any other person. 
Lincoln’s coalition won the majority of the Illinois legislature, but the coalition 
included former Democrats who would not vote for a Whig like Lincoln. In the end, 
Lincoln backed Lyman Trumbull, a former Democrat turned Republican, for the 
Senate rather than allow a Democrat to win. But during the 1854 campaign, Lincoln 
had established himself as a national actor on the political stage. Th e speeches that both 
Lincoln and Douglas made were a preview of the more formal debates that would take 
place between them 4 years later when Lincoln campaigned directly against Douglas 
in an eff ort to win his seat in the Senate. 
Across the North, the 1854 election led to victories by anti-Kansas-Nebraska Act 
coalitions in state aft er state. Democrats lost control of most Northern state legislatures. 
Th e majority of the members of the Senate were not up for election in 1854 
but the state of Wisconsin elected the fi rst Republican to serve in that body. More 
signifi cant changes came in the House of Representatives—the members of which 
are elected for 2-year terms directly by the voters, not by state legislatures. Northern 
Democrats dropped from 93 to 23 seats in the House of Representatives while 
Southern Democrats held 58 seats. But 150 members of Congress were now committed 
to stopping slavery in the territories, some as Whigs, some as Republicans, 
and some as members of minor parties. Since the formation of the Jacksonian 
Democrats and Whig opposition in the 1830s, leaders had changed party affi liations 
on occasion in response to strong issues, but never as oft en as they did in the 1850s 
as the old parties weakened. Aft er 1854, voters—South and North—cared mostly 
about whether candidates were anti- or proslavery and whether they were moderate 
or radical in their views. Th e Kansas-Nebraska Act had unifi ed Northern political 
opinion against the spread of slavery as nothing before it had done. A new political 
party, the Republican Party, was forming to speak for that point of view. Unlike the 
Whigs or the Democrats, both of which included Northern and Southern members, 
the Republican Party represented only one section of the nation and one political 
perspective. Th e party had virtually no Southerners and no one who spoke for 
popular sovereignty or any other plan to allow the growth of slavery. When the new 
Congress assembled in late 1855, the House eventually elected as its new Speaker, 
Nathaniel P. Banks of Massachusetts, a former Know Nothing who had recently 
switched his political allegiance to the Republican Party. A representative of a political 
party that had not existed 2 years earlier now held the gavel in the House of 
Representatives.

The Kansas-Nebraska Act, however, was still the law of the land in spite of the

territory in half (see Map 13-1 ). The southern portion was the modern state of

South Dakota, and North Dakota. Kansas and Nebraska each now had to decide 
whether to apply for admission to the Union as slave or free states. No one was sure 
when elections would be held or who would vote, though many wanted to control 
the outcome. While Nebraska stayed relatively calm, Kansas, with its proximity to 
the slave state of Missouri but also within easy travel of the free states of Illinois and 
Iowa was easier for Southerners and Northerners to move to. It quickly became a 
dangerous and violent place. 
Even before President Pierce appointed Andrew Reeder, a Pennsylvania Democrat, 
as territorial governor, hundreds of proslavery “border ruffians” from Missouri 
and abolitionists from the North began pouring into Kansas. Th e Missourians got 
there first and when the first elections were held for the territorial representative 
to Congress in November 1854, they won easily. Th ey also gained a majority of the 
territorial legislature that was elected in March 1855. Th e proslavery faction could 
probably have won these early elections fairly, but the votes were accompanied by 
widespread cheating, fraudulent vote counting, votes by people who still resided in 
Missouri, and voter intimidation. So the results were challenged even as more antislavery 
voters began arriving in larger numbers and quickly came to outnumber the 
proslavery advocates. 
In response to the fi rst elections, the settlers who supported admitting Kansas 
as a free state called a convention in December 1855 in which they declared the 
territorial legislature elected in March to be illegitimately elected. They then 
held their own election, established their own legislature to meet at Topeka, 
adopted a state constitution (the Topeka Constitution), and elected their own 
governor. Th us by January 1856, Kansas had two legislatures and two governors 
as well as sent two diff erent territorial representatives to Congress. For the most 
part, each faction voted in its own elections and boycotted the elections called 
by the other. 
In 1856, U.S. troops under orders from President Pierce, dispersed the Topeka 
legislature since it lacked any legal mandate to meet, and the “offi cial” legislature 
called a convention to write a state constitution. A new federal governor, Robert 
Walker, finally began to establish order in the territory and 
convinced both sides that an honest election could be held. In 
the October 1857 elections—probably the most honest in the 
territory—in which both factions voted for the fi rst time, the 
free-state faction won a sizeable majority. But while the freestate 
majority now controlled the legislature, the constitutional 
convention, which had been appointed by the previous 
proslavery legislature, continued to write a constitution. Th e 
situation in Kansas then got even more complicated. 
The proslavery convention at Lecompton, Kansas, that 
wrote what came to be known as the Lecompton Constitution 
finished its work in the fall of 1857, and a vote on the constitution 
was called for December. However, the convention 
decreed that the vote was only on the clause that would decide 
whether Kansas would be a slave or a free state. Free-state residents 
were convinced that the whole Lecompton document 
was a fatally flawed defense of slavery: even if voters made 
Kansas a free state, the Lecompton document said that slaves 
already in the territory were bound to remain slaves. They 
boycotted the election, and the proslavery clause won by a vote 
of 6,226 to 569. Th en the new legislature called for a vote on 
the whole constitution in January 1858. Proslavery residents 
boycotted this election, and the constitution was defeated by 
a vote of 10,226 to 162. Both votes were then sent forward to 
Congress to sort out.

In 1854 and 1855, thousands of “Missouri Ruffi ans” as their opponents called 
them arrived in Kansas, well armed and determined to control the territory. 
Before long, equally well-armed abolitionists from the North began arriving in 
the territory. Given the presence of so many guns and such anger, it was not 
surprising that bloodshed quickly followed.

13.1 
Aft er another long and bitter debate on Kansas in the late spring of 1858—this 
time with Douglas in opposition to admitting Kansas as a slave state because of the 
“trickery and juggling”—Congress called for a new vote in Kansas on the Lecompton 
Constitution. Th e legislation said that if the constitution passed, Kansas would gain 
immediate statehood, but if it did not, statehood would be delayed signifi cantly. In 
August 1858, Kansas voters defeated the Lecompton Constitution and the off er of 
immediate statehood by a vote of 11,300 to 1,788. Kansas would remain a territory 
until 1861. 
The 4-year battle from 1854 to 1858 gave the territory the name of Bleeding 
Kansas and hardened public opinion North and South. The battle in Kansas not 
only was confusing but also was violent. Missouri “border ruffi ans” and Missouri 
militia intimidated and killed free-state voters. But the violence was not all on one 
side. Samuel Jones, the country sheriff for Lawrence, Kansas, was shot while trying 
to serve warrants on the free-state leaders. He survived and led the militia back to 
town to take prisoners and demolish a hotel, a newspaper offi ce, and the home of the 
free-state governor. His successor threatened the free-state legislature in 1857 and 
was killed. 
John Brown came to Kansas to “strike terror in the hearts of the proslavery people.” 
Brown attacked a small proslavery community near Pottawatomie Creek and killed and 
mutilated fi ve settlers. Th e battles continued in 1856 and 1857. Missourians boarded 
steamboats on the Missouri River to search for antislavery immigrants. Both sides 
claimed their martyrs. In most parts of the territory, the U.S. Army slowly asserted 
control, but just before the fi nal resolution in May 1858, proslavery guerrillas shot nine 
unarmed free-state farmers, and fi ve of them died. 
Th e violence was not limited to Kansas. In Washington, Congressman Preston 
Brooks of South Carolina, who believed that protecting the status of Kansas as a 
slave state was a “point of honor,” badly beat Massachusetts Senator Charles Sumner 
in the Senate chamber after Sumner delivered his “Crime Against Kansas” speech 
favoring a free-state Kansas. In Brooklyn, New York, the nation’s most famous

antislavery arguments during the debates about Kansas, which Brooks took as an attack on the honor of 
his family and the South. In May 1856, Brooks came into the Senate chamber and beat Sumner with a cane 
while he sat at his desk. Sumner never fully recovered from his injuries but remained in the Senate as a 
staunch Republican through the Civil War and Reconstruction until he died in 1874.

preacher, Henry Ward Beecher warned of the need to “stand firm,” and collected 
funds for “Beecher’s Bibles,” which were Springfi eld rifl es to be sent to Kansas. Even 
aft er the nation turned to other matters, few Americans forgot the intense emotions 
Kansas aroused. 
The Supreme Court and Dred Scott 
While the battle for Kansas transfi xed the nation, a court case was making its way 
through the nation’s slow judicial process. Th e case, Dred Scott v. Sandford , resulted 
in one of the most far-reaching decisions in the history of the Supreme Court. It 
began in state courts in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1846 when abolitionists urged Dred 
Scott, a slave, to sue for his freedom because his owner, an army surgeon, had taken 
him to Illinois and then on to Fort Snelling in what is now Minnesota (then simply 
the northern tip of the Louisiana Purchase where the Missouri Compromise banned 
slavery). Aft er living for years in free territory, his lawyers claimed, Scott had won 
his freedom. 
In a series of trials and appeals, Scott’s case went back and forth. Scott lost the 
fi rst time, but on retrial in state court in St. Louis, he won his freedom. Th e Missouri 
Supreme Court then overturned the decision on appeal in 1852 and returned Scott 
to slavery. Although the Missouri high court had previously found in favor of slaves 
who had lived in free territory, ideas were hardening across the South, and the court 
concluded that Missouri law governed the case even though Scott had been in federally 
controlled free territory for years. Scott’s lawyers appealed to the federal courts, and 
when the district court in Missouri decided against Scott, his lawyers appealed to the 
U.S. Supreme Court where the case was heard in 1856. 
The Supreme Court also decided against Scott. The justices could have 
based their ruling on fairly narrow grounds. Instead, the majority used the case 
to make a larger legal point. Considerable (though behind the scenes) pressure 
was apparently brought to bear on the justices. Chief Justice Roger Taney, 
however, did not need pressure to speak his mind. On March 6, 1857, he spoke 
for a majority of the court. In a long and complex decision, Taney made two key 
points. First, as a black man (presumably even a free black man), Taney said that 
Scott had no rights that the United States needed to honor. Based on his reading 
of the Constitution, Taney said that black people “had no rights which a white 
man was bound to respect.” When two dissenting justices noted that blacks had 
actually been voters in five of the states that had ratified the Constitution in 1789, 
Taney countered that they might, indeed, “have all the rights and privileges of the 
citizen of a State,” but that they were “not entitled to the rights and 
privileges of a citizen in any other state.” This opinion seemed to 
directly contradict Article IV, Section 2, of the Constitution, which 
said, “The citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges 
and immunities of citizens in the several states,” but Taney ignored 
the clause and previous case law. 
Second, Taney broadened the ruling. Scott had no standing to bring 
the case, the Chief Justice said, and even if he did have standing, he did 
not have a case. Fort Snelling was not actually free territory because the 
Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional. Congress did not have the 
right to bar slavery in any federal territories. Depriving slave owners 
of their slaves, he said, violated the Fift h Amendment that said no one 
could be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of 
law, and slaves were the private property of their owners. He did not say 
anything about the lives or liberties of enslaved people. But he did say 
that Congress “could not authorize a territorial government to exercise” 
any power to prohibit slavery.

Th e Court not only returned Scott to slavery but also ruled that Congress could 
not prohibit slavery in any federal territory under any circumstances. Abolitionists 
soon purchased Scott and set him and his wife free. But the decision seemed to lock 
millions of their fellow African-Americans either in slavery or in second-class status 
even if they were free. 
The outcome thrilled Southern leaders. The proslavery Constitutionalist in 
Augusta, Georgia, editorialized that “Southern opinion upon the subject of Slavery… 
is now the supreme law of the land.” At the same time, many Northern Democrats 
were also delighted, seeing the decision as “the funeral sermon” of the new Republican 
Party. Many moderate Northerners, however, were outraged. William Cullen Bryant, 
editor of the New York Evening Post, wrote that Taney’s decision was a “willful 
perversion” of the Constitution. Republican leaders, especially Seward of New York 
and Lincoln of Illinois, attacked the decision as the result of a secret negotiation 
between the Chief Justice and President-elect James Buchanan. Lincoln also said that 
if the Taney policy stood, then the advocates of slavery would soon make it “ lawful 
in all the States… North as well as South .” He promised that, if a Republican were 
elected president in 1860, he would fi nd a way to undo the decision. Th e lines between 
the pro- and antislavery camps were hardening, not only in Congress but also in the 
country as a whole. 
13.2 Quick Review Why was the Dred Scott case a signifi cant turning point in public opinion— 
North and South—in the years leading up to the Civil War? 
THE ECONOMY, THE PANIC OF 1857, AND THE LINCOLN-DOUGLAS 
DEBATES 
Explain how the economic crisis of 1857 and the growing political crises of the decade 
impacted each other and led the nation to divide. 
Historians have long debated the degree to which economic issues, rather than 
arguments over slavery, caused the Civil War. Th e disagreements are nearly always 
ones of emphasis, but most agree that both issues—economic factors in the nation and 
debates over the morality of slavery—were factors. 
The growth of the cotton economy between 1815 and 1860 tied the nation 
together, creating common interests among Southern slave-owning producers 
of cotton, Northern mill owners, and owners of ships that transported cotton to 
Britain. Abolitionist Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts despaired of a country 
dominated by the “lords of the lash and the lords of the loom.” 
Other economic forces, however, were dividing the country. Th e opening of 
the Erie Canal in 1825 created an east–west trade axis from New England through 
New York and into the Midwestern states of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois with 
connections through the Great Lakes to Michigan, Wisconsin, and even Minnesota. 
This trade network rivaled and then exceeded the trade down Mississippi 
River. In 1835, 95 percent of the trade in the Ohio Valley fl owed south through 
New Orleans and only 5 percent through New York. But by 1850, more trade went 
from the Midwest to New York than to New Orleans. Midwesterners who before 
the mid-1830s saw their economic lives connected to the states that bordered the 
Mississippi were now much more connected to New York and New England and 
had little reason to care about the Southern states that had once been so important 
to them. 
As the railroads were built, slowly in the 1820s and 1830s but much more 
rapidly in the 1840s and 1850s, they also followed the newer trade routes, 
linking the Midwest to the Northeast while other rail networks linked the interior 
of the South to Charleston and New Orleans. New settlement followed the trade

routes. More and more of the growing population of the upper Midwest came 
from New York and New England, the most antislavery regions of the country. 
In the 1850s, the new Republican Party refl ected the interests of this fast-growing 
swath of the nation that stretched from New England into all of the Ohio River 
Valley and beyond to Indiana, Illinois, and Iowa. Most people in the region tended 
to be opposed to slavery, even if few were serious abolitionists. In addition, the 
Republican Party also spoke for their economic interests. John Sherman (brother 
of Civil War General William Tecumseh Sherman) began his political career as 
a Whig, but by 1854, he was elected to Congress as a Republican from an Ohio 
district on the shores of Lake Erie. Sherman said that while the Republican Party 
was born with “the immediate purpose and aim” of stopping the spread of slavery 
into the territories, it also supported an increase in the tariff to strengthen American 
industries; a homestead bill to encourage settlement of the new territories by 
people who wanted to build small family farms and who had no intention, or 
money, to bring slaves with them; land grant colleges that would serve agriculture 
and industry; and a transcontinental railroad that would link California to the East 
Coast. It was a good summary of what would become the Republicans’ economic 
program in the 1860s and 1870s, and it played well across the region. 
However, neither that same economic program nor the Republicans’ opposition 
to the spread of slavery was seen as a benefit in the South, especially the 
Deep South. Th e pre–Civil War South was not an economic backwater. Indeed, it 
was the most prosperous part of the nation in the 1850s, but the prosperity could 
not be separated from cotton growing and slavery. As much as Southern cotton 
served as the raw material for New England mills, far more of it was shipped across 
the Atlantic to the larger mills in England. As much as the South was building 
railroads—often with slave labor—its rivers and extended coastline meant that 
water transport served the South better than the North. Th e Southern planter elite 
saw far less reason than most Northerners to support federal spending on canals 
As the price of Midwestern wheat and goods produced in Pennsylvania and Ohio fell rapidly in 1857, panic 
hit the nation’s fi nancial center of New York’s Wall Street. Newsboys sold extra editions of newspapers with 
news brought by telegraph from around the country, and the papers were snapped up by fearful investors.

or a federal tariff that protected Northern industries. Southern-leaning presidents 
from Polk in the 1840s to Pierce in the 1850s vetoed bills for internal improvement 
that most Northerners, regardless of political party, badly wanted. 
The Panic of 1857 exacerbated the economic split between the regions. It was 
much more severe in the North than in the South. Overproduction of Northern wheat 
helped precipitate the panic. When the Crimean War, which had pitted Britain and 
France against Russia, ended in 1856, European farmers resumed full-scale wheat production, 
and prices for American wheat fell sharply. But the English mills continued 
to need Southern cotton, and the price of cotton held steady. Moreover, in the 
iron- and coal-producing areas of the country, Pennsylvania and Ohio, demand for 
steel fell, people lost their jobs, banks failed, and panic ensued. Not surprisingly the 
Republican platform of 1860 supported a tariff both to provide revenue for the government 
and to protect Northern industry. Th e platform solidifi ed support for the 
Republicans, especially in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. It also showed how deeply 
these states were cut off from the interests of the South where the tariff raised the cost 
of manufactured goods but did nothing to keep the price of cotton high. 
The Lincoln-Douglas Debates Defi ne the Political Parties 
On June 16, 1858, Abraham Lincoln spoke to the Republican State Convention in 
Springfi eld, Illinois, that had just nominated him as their candidate against Stephen A. 
Douglas for the U.S. Senate. Refl ecting on the Fugitive Slave Act, the Kansas-Nebraska 
crisis, and the Dred Scott decision, Lincoln quoted the Bible—well known to all of the 
convention delegates—and told them: “A house divided against itself cannot stand.” 
He continued: 
I believe this government cannot endure, permanently half slave and half free . 
I do not expect the Union to be dissolved —I do not expect the house to fall — 
but I do expect it will cease to be divided. 
It will become all one thing, or all the other. 
Either the opponents of slavery, will arrest the further spread of it, and place it 
where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate 
extinction; or its advocates will push it forward, till it should become alike lawful 
in all the States, old as well as new— North as well as South . 
With all that had happened since 1850, Lincoln could see no other option. He begged 
his fellow Republicans to be sure the outcome was what they wanted. “Th e result is not 
doubtful,” he concluded. “We shall not fail—if we stand fi rm, we shall not fail.” Some 
of the delegates who had just nominated Lincoln thought the speech was too radical 
and would hurt Lincoln in the fall elections but by 1858 he was prepared to stand fi rm 
on his ideas. 
Later that summer, on August 21, 1858, Democratic Senator Stephan A. Douglas 
met Lincoln in Ottawa, Illinois, for the fi rst of seven debates they held across Illinois in 
that election season. Douglas and Lincoln were campaigning to be elected by the Illinois 
legislature to represent the state in the U.S. Senate. Th ey were also seeking to defi ne the 
philosophy of their respective political parties. Hundreds attended their debates, and 
newspapers in every part of the country took their words to thousands of Americans. 
Th e debates were long and closely argued. Each sometimes spoke for 2 hours at a time. 
Th e speeches and the responses were not sound bites, but carefully reasoned arguments 
that forced each leader to refi ne his views and the audience to follow them closely. 
At the Ottawa debate, Douglas spoke fi rst. He painted Lincoln and the Republican 
Party (Black Republicans Douglas called them) as allies of the most radical abolitionists. 
He attacked Lincoln’s “a house divided against itself” speech. “Why can it not 
exist divided into Free and Slave States?” Douglas asked. “Washington, Jefferson, 
Franklin, Madison, Hamilton, Jay, and the great men of that day, made this government 
divided into Free States and Slave States, and left each State perfectly free to do 
as it pleased on the subject of slavery.”

Douglas also criticized Lincoln’s attack on the Dred Scott decision. 
Douglas said that he agreed with the decision and told his audience that 
Lincoln’s approach would fill Illinois with blacks who would “become 
citizens and voters, on an equality with yourselves.” He warned that 
Lincoln was trying to “array all the Northern States in one body against 
the South, to excite a sectional war between the Free States and the Slave 
States.” He and the Democrats, Douglas said, were the party of unity while 
Lincoln and the Republicans promised only civil war. In response, Lincoln 
declared that he was no abolitionist and that he had “no prejudice against 
Southern people.” He also said that he would not himself know how to 
quickly abolish slavery where it already existed and, indeed, would honor 
all of the South’s “constitutional rights,” to protect slavery. He would even 
support the Fugitive Slave Act if it “should not, in its stringency, be more 
likely to carry a free man into slavery.” But the issue for him, Lincoln said, 
was the spread of slavery in the territories. Lincoln said that he had no 
interest in “perfect social and political equality with the negro.” Douglas’s 
eff orts to say that he did were a “fantastic arrangement of words, by which 
a man can prove a horse-chestnut to be a chestnut horse.” Lincoln also 
attacked Douglas’s belief in “ popular sovereignty”: “When he invites any 
people, willing to have slavery, to establish it, he is blowing out the moral 
lights around us.” 
Th e Republicans lost the campaign for the legislature, and therefore 
Lincoln lost the senatorial election of 1858 to Douglas. But the 1858 
debates helped shape the core philosophies of the nation’s political 
parties. Th ey also put in the spotlight two political rivals who would meet 
again in 1860. 
13.3 Quick Review How did the various expressions about slavery—written, spoken, and 
acted—deepen the already profound split in the Union? 
FROM JOHN BROWN TO THE SECESSION OF THE SOUTH 
Analyze the political impact of John Brown’s raid and why Lincoln won the presidential 
election of 1860 and the southern states then voted to leave. 
Th e year 1859 was an off year in American electoral politics. Regardless, in August, not 
far north of the Mason-Dixon Line that divided Pennsylvania from Maryland and thus 
free states from slave states, people in the small town of Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, 
suddenly turned their attention to the issue of slavery and abolition. One of the nation’s 
best-known abolitionists, Frederick Douglass, who had escaped from slavery on a 
Maryland plantation when he was a young adult and began his abolitionist career with 
William Lloyd Garrison, gave a speech in the Franklin County town. Both the town’s 
Democratic and Republican newspapers gave Douglass high marks as a speaker even 
though both said they disagreed with his views. But the speech was a cover for the real 
reason for Douglass being there. He had been summoned for a secret meeting with his old 
friend John Brown, who was a fugitive for his role in the violence in Kansas and who was 
living in Chambersburg under the name of Dr. Isaac Smith. 
John Brown at Harper’s Ferry 
Douglass knew that Brown harbored dreams of sparking a slave uprising across the 
South. Until he met with him that August day in 1859, however, he had no idea how 
close Brown was to implementing his ideas. Years later, Douglass recounted their meeting 
while the two went fi shing at an old quarry: “Th e taking of Harper’s Ferry, of which

Captain Brown had merely hinted before was now declared as his settled purpose.” 
Douglass thought Brown’s idea was crazy, would result in immediate defeat, and as 
“an attack upon the Federal government…would array the whole country against us.” 
Brown was not persuaded. Douglass left Chambersburg dejected and fearful, perhaps 
doubly so because the former slave Shields Green who had accompanied Douglass 
to the meeting had decided to stay with Brown. As he told Douglass, “I b’leve I’ll go 
wid de ole man.” 
When she heard of John Brown’s raid and trial, Lydia Maria 
Child, a well-known Massachusetts abolitionist, defender 
of women’s rights and the rights of American Indians, who was also 
a popular children’s author, deplored the violence of Brown’s effort 
but offered to go to Virginia to support him while he recovered 
from his wounds and awaited execution. Virginia Governor 
Henry A. Wise, known as a moderate, responded, offering Child 
protection in Virginia but also making it clear he held her and 
her fellow abolitionists guilty of inspiring Brown’s violence. Their 
correspondence was published in Garrison’s Liberator. 
Wayland, Mass., Oct. 26th, 1859. 
Governor Wise! …Enclosed is a letter to Capt. John Brown. Will 
you have the kindness, after reading it yourself, to transmit it to 
the prisoner? 
I and all my large circle of abolition acquaintances were taken 
by surprise when news came of Capt. Brown’s recent attempt; nor 
do I know of a single person who would have approved of it had 
they been apprised of his intention. But I and thousands of others 
feel a natural impulse of sympathy for the brave and suffering 
man. Perhaps God, who sees the inmost of our souls, perceives 
some such sentiment in your heart also. He needs a mother or 
sister to dress his wounds, and speak soothingly to him. Will you 
allow me to perform that mission of humanity?... 
I have been for years an uncompromising abolitionist, and I 
should scorn to deny it or apologize for it as much as John Brown 
himself would do. Believing in peace principles, I deeply regret 
the step that the old veteran has taken…. But…I will also say that 
if I believed our religion justified men in fighting for freedom, 
I should consider the enslaved everywhere as best entitled to 
that right. Such an avowal is a simple, frank expression of my 
sense of natural justice. 
Yours, respectfully, L. MARIA CHILD. 
Richmond, Va., Oct. 29th, 1859. 
Madam: …I will forward the letter for John Brown, a prisoner 
under our laws…for the crimes of murder, robbery and treason, 
which you ask me to transmit to him.... 
You ask me, further, to allow you to perform the mission 
“of mother or sister, to dress his wounds and speak soothingly 
to him.” By this, of course, you mean to be allowed to visit him 
in his cell, and to minister to him in the offices of humanity. 
Why should you not be so allowed, Madam? Virginia and 
Massachusetts are involved in no civil war, and the Constitution 
“which unites them in one confederacy” guarantees to you privileges 
and immunities of a citizen of the United States in the State 
of Virginia. That Constitution I am sworn to support, and am, 
therefore, bound to protect your privileges and immunities as a 
citizen of Massachusetts coming into Virginia for any lawful and 
peaceful purpose. 
Coming, as you propose, to minister to the captive in prison, 
you will be met, doubtless, by all our people, not only in a 
chivalrous, but in a Christian spirit…your mission being merciful 
and humane, will not only be allowed, but respected, if not 
welcomed…. 
I could not permit an insult even to a woman in her walk of 
charity among us, though it be to one who whetted knives of 
butchery for our mothers, sisters, daughters and babes. We have 
no sympathy with your sentiments of sympathy with Brown....His 
attempt was a natural consequence of your sympathy, and the 
errors of that sympathy ought to make you doubt its virtue from 
the defect on his conduct. But it is not of this I should speak. When 
you arrive at Charlestown, if you go there, it will be for the Court 
and its officers, the Commonwealth’s attorney, sheriff and jailer, to 
say whether you may see and wait on the prisoner. But, whether 
you are thus permitted or not, (and you will be, if my advice can 
prevail,) you may rest assured that he will be humanely, lawfully 
and mercifully dealt by us in prison and on trial. 
Respectfully, HENRY A. WISE

Chapter 13 The Politics of Separation 401 
All that summer, Brown had been planning for his raid. In the fall, he moved from 
Chambersburg to a farmhouse in Maryland not far from Harper’s Ferry, where a 
lightly guarded federal arsenal stood at the junction of the Potomac and Shenandoah 
rivers. Brown and his army of 16 white and five black men began their attack on 
the evening of October 16, 1859. Th ey were confi dent that the slaves of the region 
would rise up to join them. As they entered Harper’s Ferry, they cut telegraph lines 
and took hostages, but they were also quickly attacked. Th ey were encircled by angry 
townspeople, and within hours, federal troops under the command of Robert E. Lee 
arrived in Harper’s Ferry. When Brown refused to surrender, the troops attacked, 
killing or capturing most of the rebels. Only a few escaped. Brown was wounded. 
He and the other captured fi ghters were tried on charges of insurrection and treason 
against the state of Virginia. Th e jury took less than an hour to fi nd them all guilty, 
and they were sentenced to hang on December 2, 1859. 
Brown used the 6 weeks between his arrest and execution eff ectively. His calm words 
and actions aft er the raid, much more than the raid itself, made him a hero in much of 
the North and a frightening fi gure in the South. At his trial, Brown told the court: 
Now, if it is deemed necessary that I should forfeit my life for the furtherance 
of the ends of justice, and mingle my blood further with the blood of my 
children and with the blood of millions in this slave country whose rights are 
disregarded by wicked, cruel, and unjust enactments, I say, let it be done. 
While in prison, Brown also managed to conduct interviews and write letters that were 
widely circulated. He told a reporter from the New York Herald , “You may dispose of 
me very easily…but this question is still to be settled—this negro question I mean— 
the end of that is not yet.” 
This famous painting of John Brown on his way to the gallows, stopping to kiss a slave child, shows Brown as 
the hero to the antislavery cause, which is the way that many in the North were beginning to see him.

Immediately after the October raid, virtually everyone—Democrats, Republicans, 
even many abolitionists—condemned Brown as an insane fanatic. Soon, however, public 
opinion started to shift . In the North, Brown’s words and actions began to galvanize a 
wide spectrum of public opinion. People who initially dismissed him as insane started, 
much to their own surprise, to be swayed by his condemnation of slavery and—even more 
surprising to themselves—to consider his claim that violence might be needed to end it. 
Henry David Thoreau’s “Plea for Captain John Brown” argued that Brown’s 
violence could not be compared with the violence of slavery. The pacifist William 
Lloyd Garrison criticized the raid but came to view it as “a desperate self-sacrifi ce for 
the purpose of giving an earthquake shock to the slave system.” Many Northerners 
concluded that Brown was a hero. 
Northern sympathy for Brown sent a chill through the white South. With the 
emergence of the telegraph and faster printing presses, news traveled fast. Many 
Southerners became convinced that most Northerners were in league with radical 
abolitionists like Brown and with those slaves who harbored thoughts of revolt. 
Many in the South started to think that abolitionists really did want to promote a slave 
uprising. In response, much of the South quickly became an armed camp, and doubts 
about remaining in the Union began to grow. 
The Election of 1860 
Th e Republican Party that nominated Lincoln for the Senate in 1858 was still very 
new on a fast-changing political landscape. Th e fi rst election that the new Republican 
Party contested had been in 1854 and resulted in a Republican Speaker of the House 
of Representatives. The Republicans, it seemed, were the party of the future. In 
contrast, the Democrat and the Whig parties had struggled with opposing members 
that included antislavery Northerners and proslavery Southerners. The Kansas 
situation had split both parties and was the death knell of the Whigs. Th ey never again 
nominated a candidate for president. 
By the 1856 presidential elections, the nation had three political parties, two of them 
new. Th e Democrats managed to continue as an uneasy coalition. Th e Republicans 
consolidated their strength in the North but were virtually nonexistent in the South. 
A third party, the American Party, more commonly known as the Know Nothing 
Party, gained strength as anti-immigrant hysteria swept the country. Th e Democrats 
nominated James Buchanan from Pennsylvania whose prime strength seemed to 
be an exceeding vagueness about slavery and who had been seeking the presidency 
since serving as Polk’s secretary of state in the 1840s. Th e Republicans nominated war 
hero and adventurer John C. Frémont. And the Know-Nothings nominated former 
president Millard Fillmore. Fillmore carried only Maryland where anti-immigrant 
feelings were especially strong, while Frémont carried most of the most Northern 
states and Buchanan carried the South, including the more moderate parts of the 
South, plus Illinois, Indiana, and California, winning easily. If Buchanan entered the 
White House with any mandate in 1857, it was to avoid the issue of slavery. It was one 
the new president could not possibly fulfi ll, try though he did. 
Aft er 1856, the Know Nothing Party faded rapidly. Opposition to immigration 
did not have staying power as a political issue, especially when new immigrants 
provided the swing votes in key states like New York. Most Know-Nothings 
became Republicans in an uneasy alliance with the proimmigrant faction of 
the party. Republicans were also divided on just how far to go in embracing the 
abolitionists among them. As late as June 1859, Lincoln had begged Ohio Senator 
Salmon P. Chase to be sure that the Ohio Republican Party’s demand for “a repeal 
of the atrocious Fugitive Slave Law” not become an issue in the national Republican 
convention because “it will explode it.” But aft er 1857, it was the Democrats’ turn to 
divide as it became impossible for Northern moderates like Douglas and Southern 
extremists like Jeff erson Davis to stay in the same political organization. Everyone

knew that the elections of 1860 were going to involve tough political contests. 
No one knew they would lead to war. 
While the Lincoln-Douglas debates of 1858 established Abraham Lincoln as a 
national political leader, it was by no means certain that he would be the Republican 
nominee for president in 1860. Lincoln himself had mixed feelings about a presidential 
nomination since he had hopes of a career in the U.S. Senate. The frontrunner for 
nomination was New York Senator William Henry Seward, a former Whig and a founder 
of the Republican Party. But Seward also had many enemies, people who thought he was 
too radical or who just did not trust him. Many, including Lincoln, thought that if Seward 
did not get the nomination on the fi rst ballot, his support would melt away. Two other 
prominent Republicans were also in the fi eld—Governor Salmon Chase of Ohio, one 
of the party’s staunchest opponents of slavery, and Judge Edward Bates of Missouri, the 
candidate of the more moderate Republicans. And then there was Lincoln, respected by 
everyone, an extraordinary speaker, and more moderate than either Seward or Chase. 
Lincoln’s convention manager, Judge David Davis, reported to Lincoln, “We are 
laboring to make you the second choice of all the Delegations we can, where we can’t 
make you fi rst choice.” Th e strategy worked. While Seward took the lead on the fi rst 
ballot, Lincoln—not Chase or Bates—came in second. By the third ballot, it was all over 
as delegates made Lincoln’s nomination unanimous. Of course, being the nominee of a 
new political party did not guarantee victory. Seward, Chase, and Bates all campaigned 
hard for Lincoln, and aft er the election, he appointed all three to his Cabinet as secretaries 
of state and treasury as well as attorney general. But in between the nomination 
and the victorious election, there was a hard-fought presidential campaign. 
Given the tensions in the country in the summer of 1860, it is not surprising that 
traditional political parties splintered. A faction of the old Whig Party reemerged as 
the Constitutional Union Party. It nominated slaveholder John Bell of Tennessee for 
president and Edward Everett of Massachusetts for vice president on a vague platform 
of “the Constitution, the Union, and the Enforcement of the Laws” (presumably a reference 
to the Fugitive Slave Act). Some saw this small party as the best hope to hold 
the country together through new compromises. Others ridiculed them as the “Old 
Gentlemen’s Party,” since most of those who campaigned for Bell were well past age 60. 
The Democrats, who had elected the last two presidents, met in Charleston, 
South Carolina, in April 1860. Th ey were deeply divided. Stephen A. Douglas was the 
frontrunner for the nomination, but although Douglas had once been popular in the 
South, aft er his opposition to admitting Kansas as a slave state, most Southern political 
leaders now considered him to be a traitor to their cause. Mississippi Senator Jeff erson 
Davis insisted on a platform that pledged the party to protect “the constitutional right 
of any citizen of the United States to take his slave property into the common territories.” 
But Douglas’s supporters could not stomach abandoning their candidate’s 
long-held commitment to “popular sovereignty” and would not support a platform 
that opened all the territories to slavery regardless of what the voters said. After 
57 ballots, the convention could not agree on any nominee and adjourned to meet 
again in Baltimore in 6 weeks to try again. 
When the Democrats convened again in Baltimore, however, the same splits were 
evident. One-third of the delegates—nearly all of the Southerners and a few proslavery 
Northerners—walked out of the convention. Th e remaining Democrats nominated 
Douglas and adopted a popular sovereignty platform. Th e delegates who had walked 
out of the convention organized their own convention and nominated John C. 
Breckinridge of Kentucky, who was Buchanan’s vice president, adopting the platform 
advocated by Jeff erson Davis. Southern Democrats understood that the split in the 
party would benefi t the Republicans, but they were so angry with Douglas that they 
were willing to accept that result. Some also believed that a Republican victory would 
build support for their real goal, which was secession. A Democratic Party leader and 
former congressman, William Lowndes Yancey, told a crowd in Charleston that it 
was time for “a new revolution,” and “an Independent Southern Republic.”

Th e Republican ticket did not even appear on ballots in most of the South, and 
Republican candidates would have risked their lives campaigning in the region. 
Lincoln campaigned against Douglas in the North. Breckinridge campaigned against 
Bell in the South. No one had ever seen a presidential election quite like it. Despite the 
crazy split, the North, with its larger population, was going to settle the election. 
Douglas had a chance to win the election if he and the Northern Democrats could 
carry enough Northern states and some of the slave states known as “border states” 
where Northern infl uence was strongest and the attachment to slavery was weakest 
(see Map 13-2 ). Douglas claimed to be the only candidate who could unite the nation. 
He continued to paint Lincoln as a radical and tried to frighten Northern voters by 
saying that Lincoln would bring blacks into the North as the social equals of whites 
who would also compete with whites for jobs. 
Th e Republicans had a lot going for them. Th ey were new. Th ey attracted young, 
first-time voters. They were united. Their economic policies appealed to many in 
the North. Even so, some abolitionists did not trust the Republicans. William Lloyd 
Garrison said that “the Republican party means to do nothing, can do nothing, for 
the abolition of slavery in the slave states.” Frederick Douglass, perhaps more of a 
realist, countered, saying that a Republican victory “must and will be hailed as an 
anti-slavery triumph.” 
On Election Day in November 1860, the breadth of the Republican victory was 
clear. Breckenridge carried most of the South. Bell won Virginia, Kentucky, and 
Tennessee. Although Douglas received far more votes than either Breckenridge 
or Bell, he carried only Missouri and half the electoral votes of New Jersey. Lincoln 
received only 40 percent of the national popular vote, but it was the most of any single 
candidate, and his 180 electoral votes were a solid majority. As cheering crowds 
in his hometown of Springfield, Illinois, celebrated, Abraham Lincoln, who had 
served one term in Congress and had never held an executive position, became the 
president-elect of the United States. What his election would mean for him and for 
the country only time would tell. Few thought it would lead to a long and bloody war.

As Alexander McClure, a prominent Pennsylvania attorney, wrote 40 years aft er the 
Civil War, “Th e North believed that the South was more bombastic than earnest in the 
threat of provoking civil war for the protection of slavery, and the South believed that 
Northern people were mere money-getters, ready to yield anything rather than accept 
fratricidal confl ict.” 
The Secession of the South 
As some had predicted, Lincoln’s election provided Southern secessionists with just 
the rationale they needed. Many Southerners, including moderates, were furious about 
Lincoln’s election. Th ey saw the breadth of Northern support for a committed free-soil 
candidate as one more eff ort to exclude slavery from the territories. Th ey also saw it 
as part of a larger pattern that included Northern failure to enforce the Fugitive Slave 
Act and Northern support for John Brown. Th e Charleston Courier editorialized that 
Lincoln’s election meant it was time for “a Southern Confederacy,” something “desired 
by all true hearted Southerners.” 
The night after the election, a huge crowd of demonstrators in Charleston 
demanded action, and the South Carolina legislature called a special convention 
to consider secession. On December 20, 1860, the convention voted 169–0 in favor 
of dissolving “the union now subsisting between South Carolina and other states.” 
Other states in the Deep South followed. In January 1861, Mississippi, Florida, 
Alabama, Georgia, and Louisiana all voted to leave the Union, followed by Texas

MAP 13-2 The Election of 1860. This map, indicating the electoral vote of each state, illustrates the 
regional nature of the fi nal vote in the 1860 presidential election. Lincoln carried all of the North as well 
as California and Oregon. Breckinridge, the southern Democrat, carried all of the Deep South and beyond. 
Bell, the candidate who called for glossing over all the diff erences, carried the key border states of Virginia, 
Kentucky, and Tennessee that Douglas had been counting on. In the end, Douglas carried only the slave 
state of Missouri and split the electoral votes of New Jersey with Lincoln.

on February 1. None of the other states aft er South Carolina were unanimous in 
their votes, but over 80 percent of the delegates in each of these states voted for 
secession, which was probably a fairly accurate refl ection of the opinions of the 
white male population. Nevertheless, a minority in most Southern states, even in 
the Deep South, preferred to wait and see what Lincoln would actually do, but as 
Louisiana Senator Judah P. Benjamin wrote, the “prudent and conservative men” 
of the South were not able “to stem the wild torrent of passion which is carrying 
everything before it.” 
The reality was, however, that the demands of these “prudent and conservative 
men” of the South were for things to which Lincoln would not agree. When Kentucky 
Senator John Crittenden proposed the Crittenden Compromise to preserve the Union 
by extending the Missouri Compromise line to the Pacifi c and thus protect slavery in 
the New Mexico Territory and California, Lincoln refused to consider the compromise 
even though his close ally William Seward urged him to do so. As he had made clear 
in his various campaigns, he did not intend to abolish slavery where it existed, but he 
did not want to spread slavery any further. Lincoln had also come to believe that any 
eff ort at appeasement would do nothing to control slavery but would simply open the 
door for continuing demands. Th e pressing question in February and March of 1861 
was about the slave states that had not yet voted to secede, the so-called border states 
that were closer to the North, less militant in their defense of slavery, and perhaps 
most likely to stay with the Union: Maryland, Arkansas, North Carolina, Delaware, 
Missouri and, most of all, the strategically placed states of Kentucky, Tennessee, and 
Virginia—the largest and most industrialized state in the South. Lincoln did not want 
to lose them, at least not all of them. 
In the face of the secession crisis, the wait from November 1860 to the presidential 
inauguration in March 1861 seemed especially long. The outgoing Buchanan 
administration, never decisive, seemed more unsure of itself than ever. Rumors of a 
Southern invasion or an internal coup fi lled the capital. Many senators joined Seward 
and Crittenden in seeking a compromise that would avoid secession or war. Others 
in and out of Congress proposed all sorts of solutions, including even abolishing the 
offi ce of president. Th e senators and representatives of the seven states that had voted 
to secede by February 1 packed their belongings, gave their farewell speeches, and left 
town to organize the government of the Confederate States of America—a project they 
accomplished with amazing speed at a 6-day convention in Montgomery, Alabama, 
where they draft ed a temporary constitution and selected a provisional president and 
vice president. In the meantime, the rest of the country seemed frozen. 
Although the states of the Deep South voted to leave the Union, conventions 
in Virginia, Arkansas, and Missouri did not vote on secession. North Carolina and 
Tennessee did not even hold conventions. But leaders in all of these states warned that 
any violence by the federal government against those states that had voted to leave the 
Union would force them to depart also. Some in the North seemed happy to see part 
of the South depart. Th e Chicago Tribune said that if South Carolina wanted to leave, 
“let her go, and like a limb lopped from a healthy trunk wilt and rot where she falls.” 
In New York, Horace Greeley’s Tribune said, “If the Cotton States shall become satisfi 
ed that they can do better out of the Union than in it, we insist on letting them go.” 
However, secession angered others in the North. 
One resident of Illinois wrote to Congress saying, “We elected Lincoln, and are 
just as willing, if necessity requires, to fi ght for him.” A resident of Ohio wrote that 
Lincoln “must enforce the laws of the U.S. states against all rebellion, no matter what 
the consequences.” Even Senator Seward’s wife criticized her husband’s eff orts at compromise, 
telling him, “Compromise based on the idea that the preservation of the 
Union is more important than the liberty of nearly 4,000,000 human beings cannot 
be right.” While it is likely that many Northern white voters would have been willing 
to preserve the Union at the cost of 4 million people remaining in slavery, a good

portion of Northerners—though far from all—seemed to be ready to fi ght rather than 
let the Union be dissolved. In that tense and uncertain situation, aft er months of waiting, 
Lincoln made his way from Springfi eld to Washington. 
Abraham Lincoln was inaugurated as the 16th president of the United States on 
March 4, 1861. His inaugural address broke little new ground. He said that he considered 
secession illegal and that he would assert federal authority, especially over 
forts and other federal installations in the South. He insisted that he had no interest in 
interfering with slavery in the states where it existed. And he promised to enforce the 
Fugitive Slave Act while also asserting that he wanted stronger protection against free 
people being kidnapped in the name of enforcing the law. In closing, he made a poetic 
plea that the Union must be preserved: 
We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. Th ough passion 
may have strained, it must not break our bonds of aff ection. Th e mystic chords 
of memory, stretching from every battle-fi eld, and patriot grave, to every living 
heart and hearthstone, all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of 
the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of 
our nature. 
Northern response to the speech was mixed. Garrison’s Liberator noted that Lincoln’s 
insistence that free blacks needed protection from the Fugitive Slave Act represented 
the fi rst time any president had spoken of citizenship rights for blacks—a direct contradiction 
of the Dred Scott decision. Other abolitionists were disappointed. Many 
moderates agreed with the Jersey City newspaper that said, “it was hardly possible for 
Mr. Lincoln to speak with more mildness.” 
Confederate leaders did not see the speech as mild. Lincoln’s refusal to recognize 
the right of secession and his claim on the federal property in the South seemed to 
them to be a prelude to war. Two days aft er the speech, the Confederate Congress 
authorized a call for 100,000 troops. Lincoln did not respond by making any similar 
call of his own. One of his advisors, Orville H. Browning, had written to the president 
that it was “very important that the traitors shall be the aggressors.…[T]hen the government 
will stand justifi ed, before the entire country, in repelling that aggression.” 
Th at policy was exactly the one Lincoln planned to follow. 
Conflict seemed most likely to begin at Fort Sumter, a new federal installation 
guarding the harbor of Charleston, South Carolina. Sitting within view of the city 
where secession had begun, Fort Sumter was a dramatic symbol of federal authority in 
the heart of the Confederacy. Th e 80-man garrison was commanded by Major Robert 
Anderson, a former slaveholder from Kentucky, whose decades in the army had made 
him a devoted supporter of federal authority. Soon aft er their vote to secede from 
the Union in December 1860, South Carolina authorities demanded that outgoing 
President Buchanan remove the federal garrison and hand the fort over to them. In an 
uncharacteristic show of strength, Buchanan refused and tried to reinforce the fort in 
January 1861. South Carolina fi red on the supply ship—but not the fort—and the ship 
turned back. By the time Lincoln came to offi ce in March, Anderson was running low 
on supplies and knew he would have to either surrender or evacuate soon. 
On April 6, aft er some hesitation, the new president announced that he was sending 
a supply ship with food and medicine, but not arms, to Fort Sumter. Jefferson 
Davis was not willing to allow the federal presence in what Davis now considered an 
independent country and ordered Pierre G. T. Beauregard, the officer in charge of 
Confederate troops in Charleston, to attack the fort. On April 12, 1861, at 4:30 a.m., 
shore batteries in Charleston began to shell Fort Sumter and continued to do so for the 
next day and a half. On April 13, out of food and ammunition, Major Anderson surrendered. 
Anderson and the defending troops were allowed to leave, and they sailed to 
New York where they were greeted as heroes, but the Confederates had control of the 
fort. Th e Confederates had won the battle, but they had fi red on the American fl ag and

President Lincoln declared that a state of insurrection existed and called on the 
state governors for 75,000 volunteers while also ordering the expansion of the regular 
army and navy and recalling some troops from the West. Th e attack and Lincoln’s 
response brought unity—even if temporary—to most of the North. Stephen A. 
Douglas, though seriously ill, came to the White House to promise his support and 
then returned to Illinois to tell Democrats and Republicans that they owed undivided 
loyalty to the Union. 
As the president focused on preserving the Union, some African-Americans and 
their supporters called the looming war “a White Man’s war.” Lincoln had made it clear, 
they said, that the fi ghting was to “save the union” not necessarily to free the enslaved. 
Nevertheless, some abolitionists saw an opportunity. Senator Charles Sumner of 
Massachusetts reminded Lincoln that “under the war power the right had come to him 
to emancipate the slaves.” Th e black-owned Weekly Anglo-African told readers that the 
slaves “have a clear and decided idea of what they want—Liberty.” It would take time 
before the president or Northern public opinion would agree, but some supported the 
goal of emancipation from the fi rst days of the war, especially slaves who followed the 
news closely. 
Lincoln’s call for federal troops united the South. Tennessee’s governor 
announced that his state “will not furnish a single man for the purpose of coercion, 
but fi ft y thousand if necessary for the defense of our rights and those of our 
Southern brothers.” Within days of the fi ring on Fort Sumter and Lincoln’s call for 
troops, every border state had begun to consider secession and four—Virginia, North 
Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas—voted to join the Confederacy. Th e 88 to 55 vote 
to secede in Virginia was far from South Carolina’s unanimity, and the western counties 
of Virginia later declared their loyalty to the Union. Representatives from that 
area took Virginia’s seats in Congress until West Virginia could be organized as a 
separate state in 1863. 
Missouri had its own civil war that started with mob violence in St. Louis where 
most German immigrants favored the Union cause while recent arrivals from the 
South supported the Confederacy. Th e Confederate government admitted Missouri 
as its 12th state, but Union loyalists also organized their own state government. Two 
opposing Missouri state governments sent representatives to both Washington and 
Richmond while lawlessness reigned in most of the state throughout the war. 
This popular illustration of the fi ring on Fort Sumter adds drama to the scene. Confederate guns did fi re on 
the fort almost nonstop on April 12 and 13, and the fort’s defenders, with very little ammunition, fi red back 
on occasion before fi nally, out of food and ammunition, they surrendered on April 13.

Kentucky declared neutrality. Since there was probably more proslavery and pro- 
Confederacy sentiment in Kentucky than in any other slave state that remained in the 
Union, Lincoln courted the state carefully. If Kentucky seceded, the border between 
the United States and the Confederacy would be the Ohio River, dangerously far 
north. If Kentucky stayed in the Union, then Lincoln and his generals would have 
much easier access to multiple points of attack on the heartland of the Confederacy. 
Given its strategic importance, Lincoln was reported to have said that “he hoped to 
have God on his side, but he must have Kentucky.” He got Kentucky. Th e state did 
not secede, and sentiment for preserving the Union was strong in that state, though 
Kentucky sent soldiers to both sides. Perhaps more than anywhere else, the Civil War 
in Kentucky was a war of brother against brother. Four of Henry Clay’s grandsons 
fought for the Confederacy and three for the Union. 
Th e other two border states also remained loyal to the Union: Delaware’s northerly 
location and the few slaves there made the decision almost inevitable. Maryland’s 
loyalty to the Union was assured by the infl ux of federal troops and Lincoln’s arrest 
of some pro-Confederacy members of the state legislature. If Maryland had joined the 
Confederacy, Washington would have been cut off from the rest of the country, and 
Lincoln was not going to let that happen. Th us Maryland, Delaware, and Kentucky 
remained as slave states within the Union throughout the duration of the war 
while Virginia and Missouri were represented in both the Union and Confederate 
congresses. Aft er Union victories in Louisiana and Arkansas, those states were also 
represented in the U.S. Congress by one set of people while others represented them 
in the Confederate Congress. 
Despite Lincoln’s success in retaining some of the border states, the loss of others, 
especially Virginia, was a severe blow to the Union. Over half of all those who fought in 
the Confederate Army came from border states, including several of the South’s most 
prominent generals. On the day Virginia voted to secede, Robert E. Lee was off ered 
command of the Union army but responded, “I cannot raise my hand against my birthplace, 
my home, my children.” Lee resigned from the U.S. Army and eventually commanded 
the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia. Almost as important, Virginia 
included the Tredegar Iron Works in Richmond, the only factory in the South capable 
of making heavy shells and armor, and the federal arsenal at Harper’s Ferry and the 
Gosport Navy Yard. All of these facilities were in Confederate hands by the end of April. 
Even aft er the attack on Fort Sumter and the secession of the border states, many 
doubted that a real war would take place. People in the North were confi dent that the 
South would come to its senses, perhaps aft er an easy Union conquest of Richmond, 
Virginia. People in the South were confi dent that the North was not really up for a 
fi ght, certainly not a fi ght to end slavery where it had existed for over 200 years and 
probably not a fi ght to save the Union either. Both sides were terribly wrong. 
13.4 Quick Review How did Lincoln’s election impact the thinking of people in the South and, 
therefore, the course of U.S. history? 
CONCLUSION 
Throughout the 1850s, divisions between the North and the slaveholding South 
intensifi ed despite eff orts of some politicians on both sides to keep growing tensions 
in check. The burning question that continually threatened to divide the nation— 
would slavery be permitted to expand into new territories and states—could not be 
amicably decided. 
Attempts by Southerners to defend the institution of slavery, and to ensure that 
slavery could expand into new states in the West, were met by growing choruses of 
antislavery sentiment in the North. Once-moderate opponents of slavery hardened 
their positions against the South as the events of the decade unfolded. Abolitionism,

What areas of confl ict between North and South led to the Civil War? 
What do most historians consider to be the single most important cause 
of the war? Why? 
whose adherents saw slavery as an evil that had to be destroyed, continued to grow 
in force, and many in the North, regardless of their opinions about racial equality, 
simply did not want the future of the country to be defi ned by slave labor. Slave labor, 
if it were allowed to exceed the confi nes of the South, would undermine the value of 
the “free labor” ideology of the North. 
California’s application for statehood endangered the balance of power in the 
Senate between the North and the South. In an eff ort to fi nd a new middle ground, 
the Compromise of 1850, originally planned by the aging Senator Henry Clay of 
Kentucky, admitted California to the Union as a free state but gave Southerners several 
incentives for resisting secession, including a new, strengthened Fugitive Slave 
Act. But the Fugitive Slave Act infuriated many in the North, and Northern reluctance 
to enforce the law infuriated many in the South, even people who themselves did not 
hold slaves. 
The Compromise of 1850 did not save the Union for long. Harriet Beecher 
Stowe’s 1852 novel, Uncle Tom’s Cabin , written in response to her own anger about 
the Fugitive Slave Act, may have seemed to be a romanticized version of events to 
some, but it brought the reality of the pain of slavery home to many in the North. It 
quickly became a best seller and infl amed public opinion. When Congress passed the 
Kansas-Nebraska Act in 1854 in an eff ort to organize a government for the previously 
Unorganized Territory between Minnesota and Oregon, the legislation provided new 
opportunities for slavery to spread, even in regions north of the geographical divide 
between free and slave that had been established by the Missouri Compromise in 
1820. Th e result was not only national tension but a civil war in Kansas so bloody that 
the territory came to be known as “Bleeding Kansas.” In 1857, the Supreme Court’s 
landmark decision in Dred Scott v. Sandford triggered further outrage in the North 
when it declared that the federal government had no authority to regulate the spread 
of slavery in any of the territories. In that same year, the Panic of 1857, which hit the 
North far more than the South, illustrated how distinct the two regions had become 
in their economies. Later, Southerners were outraged by Northern sympathy for the 
radical actions of John Brown when he attacked the federal arsenal at Harper’s Ferry, 
Virginia (now in West Virginia but then part of the state of Virginia), in 1859. Th ese 
events deepened sectional tensions and rivalries. As the nation responded, a new 
political party, the Republican Party, emerged, and an established political party, the 
Whigs, dissolved. At the same time, Abraham Lincoln gained national prominence as 
he campaigned fi rst for a U.S. Senate seat and then for the presidency. With Lincoln’s 
election to the presidency in 1860, tensions came to a head: a majority of Southern 
states seceded from the Union and civil war, which many hoped and expected would 
be short, began.

FROM UNION TO DISUNION 
13.1 
Analyze the political jockeying in Congress and how reaction 
to the Fugitive Slave Act and the publication of Uncle Tom’s 
Cabin, changed the opinions of many Americans—South and 
the North—making a break between them hard to avoid. 
Summary 
Many of the confl icts that wracked the Congress in 1850 had 
their roots in the U.S. War with Mexico. The admission of 
California as a free state threatened to start a process that would 
upset the careful balance of free and slave states in the Senate. 
Daniel Webster of Massachusetts, John C. Calhoun of South 
Carolina, and Henry Clay of Kentucky played key roles in the 
congressional debates over the issue. Th e Compromise of 1850 
appeared to some to resolve the regional split, but it offered 
only a temporary reduction in tensions. Th e most provocative 
provision of the compromise was the Fugitive Slave Act, which 
galvanized antislavery opinion in the North. Th e publication of 
Harriet Beecher Stowe’s book, Uncle Tom’s Cabin , brought the 
reality of slavery home to many in the North and produced a 
new wave of antislavery feeling. Th e Kansas-Nebraska Act of 
1854 revived the regional confl ict over slavery and gave rise to 
the Republican Party.

Analyze the causes and consequences of the battle over 
slavery in Kansas and the Supreme Court's decision in the Dred 
Scott case and the impact of those events on public opinion. 
Summary 
In 1846, Dred Scott, a slave, sued for his freedom on the basis 
that he and his master had lived in free territory for a number 
of years. After a long series of trials and appeals, Scott’s 
case made it to the Supreme Court in 1856. In Dred Scott v. 
Sandford , the court ruled against Scott, in a decision that had 
sweeping consequences for the debate over slavery. Th e court 
ruled that blacks had no rights of citizenship, that the Missouri 
Compromise of 1820 was unconstitutional, and that Congress 
could not prohibit slavery in any federal territory under any 
circumstances. The decision only intensified the political 
confl ict over slavery, even as it denied the government the tools 
to reach further compromise.

1860, it is not surprising that traditional political parties splintered. 
A deeply divided Democratic Party could not agree on 
a nominee and ended up with two: Stephen Douglas for the 
Northern Democrats and John C. Breckinridge for Southern 
Democrats. A remnant of the Whig Party, now calling itself 
the Constitutional Union Party, nominated John Bell. The 
Democratic split, combined with a number of other advantages, 
made Republican victory all but certain. Lincoln’s election 
sparked a secession movement in the South. Last-ditch eff orts 
to preserve the Union failed. Seven southern states formed the 
Confederate States of America, and other states soon joined 
them. The Confederates’ decision to attack Fort Sumter led 
Lincoln to prepare for war. Despite Lincoln’s eff orts to prevent 
border states from leaving the Union, more left than stayed, 
which was a severe blow to the Union.

14.1 Once Fort Sumter had been fi red on, large patriotic rallies were held 
North and South. Of course, what it meant to be patriotic varied 
depending on where one lived. Calls for volunteers by Confederate 
and Union authorities were quickly oversubscribed. Young men did not 
want to miss out on the fun and glory of what everyone thought would be 
a short war and an easy victory. A Confederate volunteer from Mississippi 
wrote home in June 1861 that he was ready “to fi ght the Yankees—all fun 
and frolic.” On the Union side a New York volunteer wrote “I and the rest of 
the boys are in fi ne spirits…feeling like larks.” 
Letters from new recruits also showed seriousness of purpose. A New 
Jersey soldier wrote that he joined the army because “Our glorious institutions 
are likely to be destroyed,” while a Midwestern recruit said that his 
service was “a duty I owe to my country and to my children to do what I can 
to preserve this government.” Sentiment among soldiers in the Confederacy 
was equally patriotic. Mississippi’s Lucius Lamar, who would achieve high 
rank in the Confederate army, said, “Th ank God! We have a country at last 
to live for, to pray for, to fi ght for, and if necessary to die for.” An enlisted 
man in the Confederate army gave a simple answer when he was asked aft er 
his capture why he, a nonslaveholder, fought for the South, “I’m fi ghting 
because you’re down here.” Soldiers were sent off in new uniforms with 
cheering parades. Th e war did not long remain so lighthearted.

Th is chapter traces life in the United States through the 4 years of the Civil War. 
Th e battles that were fought over those 4 long years determined the war’s outcome. But 
the fi ghting also helped shape public opinion. No one, North or South, was prepared 
for the terrible death toll of the war, and the fear of being killed or losing loved ones 
haunted almost everyone in the United States during the Civil War. Ideas were also 
changing throughout the nation as the war continued. Many in the North who started 
fi ghting a war to save the Union went through periods of wondering whether it might 
be better to just let the South go and then ended up fi ghting to end slavery. Many 
in the South—slaveholders and nonslaveholders alike—who started out fi ghting to 
preserve their independence from Northern influence slowly became resigned to 
a diff erent fate even if they never stopped resenting the reality that the war created. 
And many who began the war as enslaved people, offi cially “owned” by other human 
beings, ended the war as free citizens, many of them veterans of the Union army that 
had won their freedom. Th e Civil War changed all of subsequent U.S. history, and its 
impact is important to understand. 
FORT SUMTER TO ANTIETAM, 1861–1862 
Explain how the early battles of the war shaped future events. 
Aft er Fort Sumter surrendered in mid-April, no further serious battles occurred for 
the next 2 months as each side sought to understand the other’s goals and strategy. 
Both governments raised and positioned their armies. The Confederates had only 
to fi ght a defensive war to protect their territory. Th ey did not need to win victories 
in the North, only protect their lands to win what they wanted. Th e North, however, 
needed to defeat the Confederate army to reunite the nation. As the war began, the 
commander of the Union armies was the aging hero of the War with Mexico, General 
Winfi eld Scott. He proposed what came to be known as the Anaconda Plan to blockade 
the South by sea, take control of the Mississippi River, and slowly squeeze the 
Confederacy into submission—as an anaconda snake squeezed its victim—without 
a full-scale invasion of the region that he thought would be too bloody and lead to 
generations of hatred no matter what the outcome. But many Northerners believed 
that the North needed to defeat the Confederates on Confederate turf. 
Union generals wanted a lot of time to prepare supplies and train recruits. 
In Lincoln’s opinion, his generals always wanted more time—until Grant took command 
much later in the war. When General Irvin McDowell, commander of the 
Union forces in 1861, complained that he had only green recruits, the president 
responded, “[Y]ou are green, it is true, but they are green, also; you are all green alike.” 
For Lincoln, a quick attack on the Confederacy, especially if Richmond could be taken, 
would mean victory. No one was yet thinking of a long war. 
Early Inconclusive Battles 
The first serious battle of the war took place on July 21, 1861 (see Map 14-1 ). 
At Lincoln’s prodding, McDowell, with 18,000 troops, finally advanced from 
Washington across the Potomac River into Virginia. Th e army was accompanied by 
Northern reporters, members of Congress, and others who thought it would be the one 
time they would see a battle. Confederate commander Pierre Beauregard was alerted 
to the Union army’s movement by Confederate spies in Washington. Th e armies met 
at the small town of Manassas, Virginia, on Bull Run Creek. (Northerners called it the 
First Battle of Bull Run, Southerners the Battle of Manassas.) Union troops, tired from 
the long march from Washington, started to surround the Confederate forces, but 
the Confederates held their ground. In an aft ernoon charge, Confederates let out the 
scream that came to be known as the rebel yell . One Northerner said “Th ere is nothing

like it on this side of the infernal region.” Th e Union troops began to fl ee, merging with 
panic-stricken civilians who ran back to the relative safety of Washington, DC. 
Th e Battle of Manassas, or First Bull Run, was a clear Confederate victory. It gave the 
Confederates great, perhaps even dangerously high, levels of confi dence. Confederate 
newspapers asked why their generals had not gone on to capture Washington, though 
in fact McDowell had done a good job of developing the defense of the capital. 
Northerners were despairing. Horace Greeley, who had done much to stir up support 
for the war, now wrote to Lincoln, “If it is best for the country and for mankind that 
we make peace with the rebels, and on their own terms, do not shrink even from that.” 
Lincoln had no intention of taking that action, but the president now realized that it 
would take more than a few easy battles to win the war. Perhaps Mary Boykin Chesnut, 
the plantation wife who was deeply devoted to the Southern cause but never blind to 
reality, best understood the impact of the fi rst battle when she wrote that she feared 
this early victory “lulls us into a fool’s paradise of conceit.” 
Lincoln responded to the loss at Bull Run by calling for 1 million new volunteers. 
He fi red several Union generals, including the unlucky McDowell, reorganized the 
army on the Maryland–Virginia line as the Army of the Potomac —which would 
remain the prime Union army throughout the war—and appointed George B. 
McClellan to command it. He tightened federal control in Washington and Maryland. 
In addition, he reorganized federal troops in the West as a separate army, with orders 
to proceed down the Mississippi River and try to divide the Confederacy. Th e country 
was in for a long war. 
Although some in the South were clamoring for Confederate troops to march 
north and defeat the “damn Yankees,” Jefferson Davis believed that the key to 
Confederate victory was doing what George Washington had done in the Revolution: 
simply survive. In time, he hoped, Northern opinion would tire of war and foreign 
governments would recognize the South. 
Many in the South were confi dent that Britain would support them because of 
British need for Southern cotton. But they underestimated abolitionist opinion 
in Britain—which had abolished slavery in its own colonies in the 1830s—and the 
Army of the Potomac 
The main Union army led by a series of generals 
until Ulysses S. Grant took command in 1863 
and led it to the final victory in 1865. 
Soldiers on both sides, like these Union soldiers in camp, spent most of the fi rst months of the war either in 
training or sitting in camp and waiting. Note the one African-American off to the side. This early in the war, 
African-Americans were not yet in uniform, but that would soon change.

MAP 14-1 Major Civil War Battles, 1861–1862. As this map shows, during the fi rst 2 years of the war, the 
major battles took place in northern Virginia, where the Confederacy tried to defend its capital of Richmond 
and Union forces defended Washington, DC, and in the Mississippi River valley.

caution of the British government, which wanted to “keep quite clear of the confl ict.” 
Some owners and workers in the cotton mills in Manchester and Liverpool wanted a 
Confederate victory, but overall, British opinion was opposed to slavery. In the end, 
Britain stayed neutral. 
General McClellan was a fi rst-rate organizer, and he trained the Union army well. 
Th e Army of the Potomac became a strong fi ghting force. Nevertheless, McClellan 
was never quite ready to fi ght. In one meeting with Lincoln, the general made but one 
request, “Just don’t let them hurry me, is all I ask.” By October 1861, McClellan was 
in command of 120,000 soldiers. Th e Confederate Army in Virginia was about 45,000 
strong, but McClellan was sure it included at least 150,000 soldiers. Considering the 
possibilities for terrible loss of life, McClellan’s caution is understandable. For Lincoln, 
however, that kind of caution would result only in the end of the Union. 
By December 1861, there had been no major land battle since Bull Run. Th e cost 
of maintaining and supplying an army was still high, however, much higher than the 
expenditures of any previous peacetime government had been. Secretary of the Treasury 
Salmon Chase reported difficulty balancing the federal budget. The London Times 
reported “the independence of the South virtually established.” Then McClellan got 
sick. In January 1862, a discouraged Lincoln said, “Th e people are impatient; Chase has 
no money;…Th e General of the Army has typhoid fever. Th e bottom is out of the tub. 
What shall I do?” 
The U.S. Navy Takes Control of Southern Rivers and Ports 
The Union cause was not as bleak as Lincoln feared. Although the North and South 
began the war with more or less equal size armies, the North had a much stronger navy. 
As early as August 1861, the U.S. Navy attacked Confederate fortifi cations on the Atlantic 
and Gulf coasts. By November, the Union controlled the sea islands off South Carolina 
and, not incidentally, some 10,000 slaves who had been left behind by fl eeing plantation 
owners. With the U.S. Navy attacking Southern coastal fortifi cations and beginning a 
blockade of Southern ports early in the war, the South was losing access to the Atlantic. 
By April 1862, only the ports of Charleston, South Carolina; Wilmington, North Carolina; 
and Savannah, Georgia, were still open. From these ports, the South sent fast blockaderunning 
ships to maintain contact with the rest of the world, getting supplies from the 
Bahamas, Bermuda, and Cuba as well as from Britain and France, but at high cost. 
Th e closing of its ports by the U.S. Navy also led the Confederacy to build a new 
kind of ship. At the Tredegar Iron Works in Virginia, armor plates were placed 
on a salvaged ship that had been the U.S.S. Merrimack but was renamed the C.S.S. 
Virginia . Th e Virginia also had 10 well-protected guns and an iron ram that could sink 
wooden ships. While the North celebrated the early naval victories, word of a new 
Southern ironclad led the U.S. Navy to plan for a similar ship. An eccentric designer, 
John Ericsson, proposed a strange but potentially powerful design for an ironclad that 
looked like a fl oating raft that had a revolving gun turret with two 11-inch guns. His 
ship was named the Monitor . When the C.S.S. Virginia sank two Union ships off the 
mouth of the James River, the Navy ordered the Monitor to proceed south from the 
Brooklyn Navy Yard without even time for a test run. On March 9, 1862, the crew of 
the Virginia saw something they thought “was a raft ” taking one of the Navy ships 
boilers “to shore for repairs,” but then the boiler started fi ring at them. Aft er hours of 
fi ring and maneuvering, the Virginia returned to port, and each side declared victory. 
Th e two ships never fought again—the crew of the Virginia blew up their ship rather 
than let it fall into Northern hands when the Union army invaded Virginia in May 
1862, and the Monitor sank in a gale. But naval warfare had changed forever as the 
two ships showed that ironclads could easily defeat a wooden-hulled navy. For the 
remainder of the Civil War, however, fast wooden ships continued as best they could 
to keep the Confederacy supplied with war material by outrunning the U.S. Navy, and 
the U.S. Navy blockaded most Southern commerce.

In early 1862, the U.S. Navy also won important battles on the Mississippi River. 
Cairo, Illinois, where the Ohio River fl ows into the Mississippi, was the southernmost 
city under Union control. South of Cairo, the Confederacy controlled the Mississippi as 
well as the Cumberland and Tennessee Rivers that fl owed into it. Th e navy commander 
at Cairo was Andrew H. Foote, a sober abolitionist, while the army commander was 
the hard-drinking Ulysses S. Grant, who had given little thought to abolition before 
the war. Together, they attacked the South’s rivers. On February 6, 1862, Union forces 
overwhelmed Confederate Fort Henry, and Union gunboats turned the Tennessee 
River into a Union thoroughfare. Grant became a hero. Th e Union controlled most of 
Kentucky and Tennessee. Southern optimism disappeared. 
In April 1862, a fleet commanded by David G. Farragut got past a string of 
Confederate forts and took New Orleans, the largest city in the South, which remained 
in Union hands for the duration of the war. Farragut’s ships moved up the Mississippi, 
capturing Baton Rouge and Natchez by the end of June. Only Vicksburg on high 
bluff s over the Mississippi River prevented complete Union control of the river, which 
would have cut the Confederacy in half. 
The Beginning of a Long War 
While the Union navy won battles, General Grant led 40,000 troops in an attack on 
Corinth, Mississippi. Corinth was where the South’s major north-south and east-west 
rail lines crossed, and Grant meant to disrupt the network. Before Grant’s forces got 
to Corinth, however, Southern forces attacked the Union army near Shiloh Church 
in Tennessee on April 6. In 2 days of terrible fi ghting, Grant won, but at a high cost of 
killed or wounded troops—13,047 for the Union and 10,699 for the Confederates. 
Shiloh undermined morale in both armies. A Confederate private wrote, “I never realized 
the ‘pomp and circumstance’ of the thing called glorious war until I saw this.…Men… 
lying in every conceivable position; the dead…with their eyes wide open, the wounded 
begging piteously for help.” Union General William T. Sherman said, “Th e scenes on this 
fi eld would have cured anybody of war.” Th e cost of the Union victory at Shiloh convinced 
many that it would be a long and terrible war. Mary Boykin Chesnut wrote in her diary, 
“I have nothing to chronicle but disasters.” Nevertheless, by May 1862, Union forces had 
won control of several Southern rivers and cities, disrupted the Southern rail system, and 
taken many prisoners. Grant, however, would spend the next year stalled at Vicksburg. 
The seagoing ironclad ships, the Virginia (formerly the Merrimack ) and the Monitor fought one battle in 
March 1862, but the Union Navy’s smaller ironclad riverboats, like the one shown here, did more to turn the 
tide of the war as they attacked Confederate fortifi cations all along the Mississippi River and its tributaries.

With Union victories in the west, Lincoln urged McClellan to attack the 
Confederate forces in the east. Th e Confederate Army of Northern Virginia was 
the South’s elite force, assigned to protect the capital of Richmond, Virginia, and the 
essential supply sources nearby. McClellan landed troops on the Virginia coast to 
march up the peninsula—hence the name the Peninsular Campaign of 1862 —to 
capture Richmond. With 135,000 troops, he seemed poised for victory. But McClellan 
moved slowly, with great caution, driving Lincoln to distraction. 
In May and June 1862, Confederate General Stonewall Jackson defeated Northern 
forces in the Shenandoah Valley and kept Knoxville and much of east Tennessee in 
Confederate hands. It was an area fi lled with Northern sympathizers. But Jackson kept 
winning. Northern troops had had to be diverted from the attack on Richmond to deal 
with Jackson, whose troops had captured badly needed food and medical supplies. 
At the end of May, Union and Confederate forces fought a series of inconclusive 
engagements at the Chickahominy River only a few miles from Richmond. Jeff erson 
Davis made Robert E. Lee commander of the Army of Northern Virginia, a move that 
almost turned the tide of war. Lee forced McClellan to pull back from Richmond to 
the James River. Th e costs of the war were getting higher. General D. H. Hill, whose 
unit Lee had ordered to attack Union forces at Malvern Hill on July 1, said of the 
result, it “was not war—it was murder.” Some 20,000 Confederates had been killed or 
wounded, twice as many as in the Union army, but Lee kept up the pace. 
At the end of August 1862, Union and Confederate armies met again at Manassas on 
Bull Run Creek where the South had won its fi rst victory a year before. Th e Confederates, 
led by Lee and Jackson, again defeated the Union army, which pulled back into northern 
Virginia. At the beginning of the summer, Union soldiers could hear the church bells of 
Richmond. By the end of August, Richmond was safe, and the Confederate army was 
within 20 miles of Washington, DC. It was a major reversal of fortunes. 
Army of Northern Virginia 
The main Confederate army led for most 
of the war by Robert E. Lee, it fought in 
Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania before 
surrendering at Appomattox Court House in 
April 1865.

By the fall of 1862, Lee and Jefferson Davis wanted a decisive win as badly as 
Lincoln had. Th e Confederate army planned to encircle Washington, DC. At Antietam 
Creek near Sharpsburg, Maryland, McClellan attacked Lee’s army on September 17, 
1862. Th e result was the single bloodiest day of the war with approximately 23,000 
soldiers killed or wounded—four times the number of U.S. soldiers killed or wounded 
on D-Day in World War II. Neither side could claim victory at Antietam, but neither 
side was defeated. Th e next day, Lee withdrew his army to the relative safety of the 
Shenandoah Valley in Virginia, but McClellan did not pursue Lee’s retreating forces, 
which was the last straw for Lincoln. When a month later McClellan still had not 
moved and reported that he needed to rest his horses before any attack, Lincoln 
telegraphed, “Will you pardon me for asking what the horses of your army have done 
since the battle of Antietam that fatigue anything?” It was the end of the president’s 
patience, and he relieved McClellan of command. 
14.1 
Quick Review Why were early Union Army generals so reluctant to fi ght as hard as 
Lincoln wanted? Why was the Navy so important to the North’s ultimate victory? 
THE ROAD TO EMANCIPATION 
Analyze how the war influenced attitudes toward slavery in white and black communities, 
leading to the Emancipation Proclamation and to black soldiers in the Union army. 
Lincoln had long insisted that although he personally thought slavery evil, it was not 
the role of the national government to interfere with the settled institutions of states. 
Soon after his election, he wrote to former Congressman Alexander Stephens of 
Georgia, who was trying to convince his state not to secede: 
Do the people of the South really entertain fears that a Republican administration 
would, directly, or indirectly , interfere with their slaves, or with them, 
about their slaves? If they do, I wish to assure you, as once a friend, and still, 
I hope, not an enemy, that there is no cause for such fears. 
Aft er he had assumed offi ce, and even aft er the fi ghting began, Lincoln kept restating 
the same position. 
Once the Southern states began to secede, his top priority was to hold the Union 
together with or without slavery. As late as August 1862, Lincoln wrote to Horace 
Greeley, knowing that his words would be published in the New York Tribune, insisting, 
“My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to 
save or destroy slavery.” He closed the letter noting that this was his offi cial position but 
that he also intended “no modifi cation of my oft -expressed personal wish that all men 
everywhere could be free.” But his offi cial position was evolving, and some historians 
would argue so were his personal views. 
Contraband of War 
While Lincoln’s views were evolving, slaves and former slaves were clear on what they 
wanted from the war. Only a month into the Civil War, on May 23, 1861, three slaves 
found their way to the Union-held Fortress Monroe in Virginia and asked the fort’s 
commander, General Benjamin F. Butler, for his protection. Butler, needing workers, 
put them to work. He also coined a term for escaped slaves who came behind Union 
lines: “contraband of war.” 
Since American law then defi ned slaves as private property, and since international 
law allowed belligerent nations to seize goods and property meant to help the 
other side wage war, there was logic to Butler’s new term. If slaves were property that 
the Confederacy planned to use against the Union, then the Union had a right to seize 
that property. Th roughout much of the war, slaves who fl ed to the Union army were

known as contrabands . Th ere were “contraband camps” and “contraband schools.” 
Word of Butler’s decision spread rapidly. More slaves started coming to Fortress 
Monroe, which some now called “freedom fort.” Lincoln was not yet ready to set fi rm 
policy, but Butler’s policy was “approved,” and Fortress Monroe continued to be a 
haven for escaping slaves. 
Nevertheless, federal authorities—including new offi cials appointed by Lincoln— 
continued to enforce the Fugitive Slave Act in the District of Columbia, and some 
generals returned slaves to their “rightful” owners. With no national policy to guide 
him, General John C. Frémont, the head of the U.S. Army in Missouri, announced 
that his troops would emancipate any slave belonging to a Confederate supporter. 
Th is announcement infuriated Lincoln because he believed that he—and not one of 
his generals—should decide an issue as weighty as emancipation. 
Lincoln pressed for compensated emancipation in which the government would 
pay to free slaves in the areas loyal to the Union. Slaveholders in Kentucky, however, 
had no interest in giving up their slaves with or without payment, and the idea went 
nowhere. Lincoln also pursued the possibility of colonization in which freed slaves 
could leave the United States for Central America or even Africa. No nation showed 
much interest in the project, and freed slaves showed even less interest. Lincoln continued 
to be more interested in keeping Kentucky loyal to the Union than in the fate of 
any slaves. A Northern reporter noted, “In all attempts to soothe southern wrath, the 
negro is thrown in as the off ering.” Well into 1862, there was little cause for optimism 
for those who wanted the war to end slavery. Former slave and abolitionist leader 
Frederick Douglass wrote of his disappointment: “In dealing with the causes of our 
present troubles, we fi nd in quarter high and low, the most painful evidences of dishonesty.” 
For Douglass, the problem was obvious, “We have attempted to maintain 
our Union in utter defi ance of the moral chemistry of the universe.…We have sought 
to bind the chains of slavery on the limbs of the black man, without thinking that at last 
we should fi nd the other end of that hateful chain about our own necks.” Regardless, 
in 1862, most of Northern white public opinion was not ready to agree with Douglass. 
contrabands 
Also known as contraband of war, the name 
Union generals gave to former slaves who 
escaped to the Union lines and worked in 
support of Union troops. 
colonization 
A plan, popular in the 1830s and briefly 
considered by President Lincoln, to create 
colonies in Africa to which former slaves 
might return. It was never popular with 
slaves or former slaves themselves. 
In the summer of 1862, a group of former slaves, now offi cially contraband of war, waited for their next 
assignment. Before long many such former slaves would be fi ghting as full-fl edged soldiers in the Union army.

As the Union army marched deeper into the Confederacy, however, commanders 
realized that slaves could be of great value to them. Slaves knew the country, they knew 
hidden roadways, and they knew what white Southerners were thinking. George E. 
Stephens, one of the few black newspaper reporters accompanying Union troops, 
wrote that “when the Union soldier meets the negro in the enemy’s country, he 
knows him as a friend.” For many Union soldiers, meeting slaves fi rsthand began to 
change their minds. Future president James A. Garfi eld, commanding an Ohio unit 
in Tennessee, said that he found “the rank and fi le of the army steadily and surely 
becoming imbued with sympathy for the slaves and hatred for slavery.” 
With or without authorization, some blacks began to fi ght in the Union army. In Indian 
Territory (Oklahoma), blacks who lived with Creeks and Seminoles joined them in attacking 
other tribal members who had signed a treaty with the Confederates. Union offi cers 
in Kansas and on the coast of South Carolina began to recruit black troops. Secretary of 
War Edward M. Stanton approved the move, though he asked his offi cers to keep it quiet 
because it was “so much in advance of public opinion.” But the government needed more 
soldiers, and many blacks wanted to fi ght—if the fi ghting was for their freedom. 
Issuing the Emancipation Proclamation 
President Lincoln also began to change his mind. Lincoln was far too wise a politician 
to reveal all of his thinking. He had long said that although he thought slavery a 
terrible evil, the Constitution protected slavery where it already existed, and his only 
goal was stopping its spread into new territories. In 1861 and early 1862, his priority 
was securing the loyalty of Kentucky and other border states, which meant protecting 
slavery there. He understood that many Northerners feared free blacks almost as much 
as they disliked slavery. Public opinion would support a fi ght to save the Union, but 
not necessarily a fi ght to end slavery. 
But by 1862, Northern opinion was changing. Generally, the Northern thinking 
was that the slaveholding South was waging war against the United States because 
it wanted to defend the institution of slavery, and it was using slaves to support the 
war eff ort while its young white men went off to war. Abolitionists were getting an 
audience where they had previously been shunned. Blacks were willing to fi ght in the 
Union army when many whites were not. And many slaves were fl eeing to the Union 
lines. In July 1862, the Republican-dominated Congress declared that anyone convicted 
of assisting the rebellion against the U.S. government was liable to seizure and 
sale of all property and that all rebel-owned slaves who escaped to the Union army 
were “forever free of their servitude.” Lincoln then began discussing emancipation 
with his cabinet in July. Secretary of State Seward among others urged caution until a 
Northern victory would make talk of emancipation look less like a desperate measure. 
On September 22, 1862, Lincoln told his cabinet that he had promised God that 
if Lee’s army was forced out of Maryland where they were then trying to encircle 
Washington, DC, then he would act. Th e Battle of Antietam enabled him to do so. 
Senator Sumner had told him more than a year before that the South’s rebellion gave 
the president war powers, including the right to seize property, even the kind of private 
property known as slaves. Th e proclamation that Lincoln was planning to issue was, 
he said, a matter of military strategy. It was also directed at building Northern support 
for the war, especially black and abolitionist support. His proposed emancipation 
would apply only to those areas of the country that were in a state of rebellion as of 
January 1, 1863. Lincoln hoped that, as a result, at least some areas would vote to shift 
sides and support the Union, and in an ironic twist, voters in Tennessee and southern 
Louisiana around New Orleans—both areas where the Union army was in control— 
did just that, thus exempting themselves from the impact of the proclamation. 
The Emancipation Proclamation did not free a single slave when it was first 
issued. It did not apply in areas loyal to the Union, including slave states, and though 
it technically freed all of the slaves in the Confederate areas, the government had no

power as of yet in areas that were not under Union control. However, the proclamation 
did resolve the issue of contraband slaves, made abolishing slavery a military goal, and 
fundamentally changed the Civil War. 
Northern Democrats immediately attacked the proclamation. While the Democratic 
minority in Congress supported the war eff ort to save the Union, they opposed any widening 
of the war’s goals. By 1862, some in Congress known as Peace Democrats advocated 
letting the Confederacy go rather than endure further bloodshed. In the November 
1862 congressional elections, Peace Democrats attacked Republicans because, they said, 
the Emancipation Proclamation was widening the purpose of war and therefore making 
it longer and more bloody. Th e New York Democratic platform called the Emancipation 
Proclamation “a proposal for the butchery of women and children, for scenes of lust 
and rapine, and arson and murder.” For governor, New York’s Democrats nominated 
Horatio Seymour who said that “the people of the South should be allowed to withdraw 
themselves from the government.” Seymour won, as did a Democrat in New Jersey, 
Joel Parker, who, although a “war Democrat” because he supported the war eff ort, was 
highly critical of the Emancipation Proclamation. Democrats gained control of the state 
legislatures in Illinois and Indiana. Northern Democrats opposed to emancipation also 
won 34 more seats in the House of Representatives. Since few Southerners remained in 
Congress, this number was not enough to win a majority, but it expanded the infl uence 
of those who wanted to challenge the president’s new war goals. 
Th e November 1862 Democratic gains seem to have hardened the views of Lincoln 
and his cabinet. Just aft er the election, Attorney General Edward Bates, usually one 
of the cabinet’s more cautious members, ruled that free blacks had all the rights of 
citizens and that the Dred Scott decision held “no authority” except in the specifi c 
circumstances of the case. Bates’s ruling did not include voting rights; free blacks 
were considered like women and children, who were citizens but could not vote. 
Nevertheless, they were now citizens. 
On January 1, 1863, Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation, declaring 
that all slaves in areas then in rebellion—about 3 million of the nation’s 4 million 
slaves—“are and henceforth shall be free,” and that the military should “recognize and 
maintain” their freedom. Th e proclamation also said that black soldiers and sailors 
could be organized in the “armed service” of the United States. Th ere was no stirring 
rhetoric about human rights, only a claim of “military necessity,” but the Civil War was 
now a war to end slavery. 
While Northerners debated and voted, slaves in the South voted with their feet. 
Slaves came to understand that their freedom was one of the issues the war would settle. 
Early in the war, many Virginia plantations lost all their slaves, and by August 1862, as 
Confederate troops had to be diverted from fi ghting to ensure that slaves did not escape, 
a North Carolina resident wrote that “our Negroes are beginning to show that they 
understand the state of aff airs, and insolence and insubordination are quite common.” 
Black Soldiers in the Union Army 
In January 1863, just aft er Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation, the Weekly 
Anglo-African said , “A century may elapse before another opportunity shall be aff orded 
of reclaiming and holding our withheld rights.” Blacks, both slave and free, joined the 
military in great numbers. More than 180,000 black soldiers—one-fi ft h of the nation’s 
adult black male population under age 45 and about 10 percent of the total Union 
force—eventually fought for the Union. 
Former slaves quickly signed up for service, especially in the west where Grant 
encouraged full inclusion of blacks in the army. In Massachusetts, Governor John 
Andrew, with Lincoln’s support, authorized the organization of what became the 
Fift y-fourth and Fift y-fi ft h Massachusetts regiments. Civil War regiments were typically 
organized by states, but the Fifty-fourth and Fifty-fifth, although they were 
Massachusetts regiments, recruited free blacks from across the North—though with 
Peace Democrats 
Also known as Copperheads, a large faction 
within the Democratic Party that advocated 
immediate peace with the Confederacy on 
terms that would allow it to leave the Union.

white offi cers. In rural Franklin Country, Pennsylvania, not far from the Mason-Dixon 
Line, 45 free black men signed up for the Fift y-fourth regiment and more joined the 
Fift y-fi ft h. Most free blacks who volunteered for service were from the lowest rungs of 
the economy, including Th omas Burgess, a carpenter; Joseph Christy, a woodcutter; 
and Hezekiah Watson and Th omas Cuff , quarrymen. Th e bounties paid to all soldiers 
for joining and the subsequent pay mattered to poor families—black or white. Th e 
opportunity to fi ght for freedom mattered even more to black soldiers. 
In spring 1863, black soldiers in Louisiana fought hard and rescued white troops 
who faced defeat, turning what could have been defeat into a victory. At Fort Wagner, 
South Carolina, the Fift y-fourth Massachusetts regiment lost half its number, including 
its white commander Robert Gould Shaw, aft er requesting the right to be fi rst in the 
assault. Aft er those encounters, many shared Secretary of War Stanton’s view that these 
troops were “among the bravest of the brave in fi ghting for the Union.” Th eir bravery 
convinced some, including Lincoln, that they were as deserving as any whites not only of 
their freedom but also of the right to vote and participate equally in the political process. 
Black soldiers also demanded, and eventually got, equal treatment within the army. 
Offi cers were told that any soldier, whatever his rank, who mistreated freedmen would 
be dismissed. Th e Militia Act of 1862 set the pay of black soldiers at the level of military 
laborers on the assumption that their work would be behind the lines. As their 
role changed, black soldiers demanded equal pay. Soldiers in the Massachusetts Fift yfourth 
and Fift y-fi ft h regiments refused to accept any pay until it was raised to that of

S usie King Taylor (1848–1912) published her autobiography 
long after the Civil War, but her memories of the war and the 
rumors of freedom that arrived in advance of the reality remained 
vivid. Taylor was born in rural Georgia but lived in Savannah as a 
child where she attended a secret—and illegal—school for slaves 
and learned to read and write. Soon after her trip to St. Simon’s 
Island and freedom with the Union army, she opened a school for 
other newly freed slaves and later taught black troops to read and 
write while also serving as a nurse. 
I WAS born under the slave law in Georgia, in 1848, and was 
brought up by my grandmother in Savannah. There were three 
of us with her, my younger sister and brother. My brother and I 
being the two eldest, we were sent to a friend of my grandmother, 
Mrs. Woodhouse, a widow, to learn to read and write. She was a 
free woman and lived on Bay Lane, between Habersham and 
Price streets, about half a mile from my house. We went every day 
about nine o’clock, with our books wrapped in paper to prevent 
the police or white persons from seeing them. We went in, one at 
a time, through the gate, into the yard to the L kitchen, which was 
the schoolroom. She had twenty-five or thirty children whom she 
taught, assisted by her daughter, Mary Jane.… 
About this time I had been reading so much about the 
“Yankees” I was very anxious to see them. The whites would tell 
their colored people not to go to the Yankees, for they would harness 
them to carts and make them pull the carts around, in place 
of horses. I asked grandmother, one day, if this was true. She 
replied, “Certainly not!” that the white people did not want slaves 
to go over to the Yankees, and told them these things to frighten 
them. “Don’t you see those signs pasted about the streets? one 
reading, ‘I am a rattlesnake; if you touch me I will strike!’ Another 
reads, ‘I am a wild-cat! Beware,’ etc. These are warnings to the 
North; so don’t mind what the white people say.” I wanted to see 
these wonderful “Yankees” so much, as I heard my parents say 
the Yankee was going to set all the slaves free.… 
On April 1, 1862, about the time the Union soldiers were firing 
on Fort Pulaski, I was sent out into the country to my mother. I 
remember what a roar and din the guns made. They jarred the earth 
for miles. The fort was at last taken by them. Two days after the taking 
of Fort Pulaski, my uncle took his family of seven and myself to 
St. Catherine Island. We landed under the protection of the Union 
fleet, and remained there two weeks, when about thirty of us were 
taken aboard the gunboat P—, to be transferred to St. Simon’s 
Island; and at last, to my unbounded joy, I saw the “Yankee.”

white soldiers. In June 1864, Congress provided equal pay and enlistment bounties for 
blacks and whites. In the army, blacks also had equal rights in military courts and rights 
to testify in trials, something they could not do as civilians in most of the country. 
Finally, during the last months of the war, blacks were promoted to the offi cer ranks. 
Th e presence of black troops in the Union army enraged many in the Confederacy. 
In May 1863, the South refused to include black troops in prisoner of war exchanges 
since they had declared all such troops to be runaway slaves who should be returned 
to slavery. In response, and despite pressure, Lincoln suspended the exchange of 
prisoners until early 1865 when the Confederacy agreed to resume exchanges. Black 
prisoners of war were treated more harshly than white prisoners. In April 1864, when 
the Union garrison at Fort Pillow, Tennessee, surrendered to Confederate General 
Nathan B. Forest, he ordered the massacre of black soldiers. Blacks who fought knew 
what danger they faced, and they fought anyway. 
14.2 Quick Review How did the battles fought at the beginning of the Civil War change people’s 
attitudes about the war in the North and the South? 
THE HOME FRONT—SHORTAGES, OPPOSITION, RIOTS, AND BATTLES 
Explain how the war’s death toll and civilian shortages affected life—North and South— 
during the war. 
Aft er the initial euphoria wore off , and as the reports of casualties began to circulate, 
support for the war dropped in both the North and the South. Even those supporting 
the war had second thoughts. It was not only the terrible toll from the battlefi elds, 
though nearly every family was touched by those losses, but also the war’s eff ects on 
the home front, which had not been expected when it began. 
Infl ation and Bread Riots in the South 
Th e war’s heaviest toll was in the South. Th e Confederate government never succeeded 
in placing its fi nancial house in order. Southern politicians had long objected to federal 
tariffs and other taxes. It was hard now that independence was claimed to turn to

these taxes. Although there were modest tax increases, the Confederate government 
was always short of money. To fi nance the war, the Confederates issued war bonds. It 
was fair, many argued, for future generations to pay the cost of the war. But buying war 
bonds that paid 8 percent per year in interest when infl ation was running at 12 percent 
per month was not a good investment. And even rich Southerners oft en did not have 
much cash to invest. Southern wealth was invested in land and slaves, and neither could 
be easily converted to cash, especially in wartime. So the Confederate government 
sought to solve its fi nancial problems by simply printing more money—$20 million in 
May 1861, $100 million in August. Creating more currency, however, caused terrible 
infl ation that undermined the sale of war bonds and drove the price of goods out of 
sight. In 1862, Southern workers saw their wages increase by about 55 percent while the 
cost of living increased by 300 percent. Th e price of salt, essential to preserving meat, 
rose from $2 a bag before the war to $60 by the fall of 1862. In addition, the disruption 
of southern transportation, especially aft er the loss of the rail terminals in Memphis in 
June 1862, meant that though one area might have ample supplies of food, other areas 
were literally starving. 
Managing the home front in the South fell primarily to women. During the war, 
three out of four white men of military age—ultimately defi ned by the Confederate 
government as ages 17 to 50—served in the army, and one out of fi ve of this age range 
were killed in the war. Margaret Junkin Preston of Lexington, Virginia, described 
a world in which there were “no men left.” In New Bern, North Carolina, women 
wrote to the governor to say that of 250 whites remaining in their town, only 20 were 
male, and of these 11 were old and three about to join the army. And in Carrollton, 
Alabama, a woman wrote to her governor in 1862 to say that the latest call for soldiers 
“almost literally depopulates the country of men.” For white women, this situation 
meant taking on new roles, including managing slaves. In 1863, Lizzie Neblett of 
Texas wrote to her husband that she was “doing my best,” as a manager and overseer, 
but by 1863, she realized that the news of the Emancipation Proclamation spreading 
in the slave quarter had changed everything: “I don’t think we have one who will 
stay with us.” Letters to distant husbands refl ected how terribly their wives 
missed them and how these long separations were changing women’s role in 
a society that had prided itself on male dominance and female fragility. As 
the Montgomery Daily Advertiser wrote in July 1864, “Th e surface of society, 
like a great ocean, is upheaved, and all the relations of life are disturbed and 
out of joint.” 
In spring 1863, food shortages led to bread riots across the South from 
Richmond, Virginia, to Mobile, Alabama. Women, oft en wives whose husbands 
were off fi ghting and who were trying desperately to sustain themselves 
and their children, attacked shops and warehouses. 
By March 1863, the Army of Northern Virginia was subsisting on half 
rations, but the women of Richmond had far less. In April, a mob of over 1,000 
women shouting “Bread, Bread” and “Our children are starving,” began looting 
shops in Richmond—fi rst for bread and then for clothing. When President 
Davis threatened to shoot rioters, they disbursed, but the anger did not subside. 
Th e government tried to distribute food and to stop hoarding in warehouses. 
Nevertheless, as the war continued, it created streams of refugees, 
infl ation, and starvation across the South. As many as 50,000 civilians died in 
the South during the war, in addition to the 260,000 Confederate war dead. 
Taxes, Mourning, and Resistance in the North 
Life was easier in the North. Most of the fi ghting took place on Southern soil, 
and the Northern economy was more stable. Th e North also had an established 
Treasury Department and tax system when the war began, though 
revenue that had been suffi cient for the 1850s was not even close to meeting

the needs of a war economy. The financier Jay Cooke, one of the richest and most 
reviled bankers of his day, advised the Treasury Department and created new federal 
bonds in amounts that allowed not only banks but also individuals to buy war bonds. 
Cooke made a signifi cant profi t on these transactions, but the bonds kept the government 
solvent. 
Congress also created the Internal Revenue Service and began a federal income 
tax in August 1861. Most people were exempt from the tax since income under $800 
per year was not taxed, and only a minority made more than that. Finally, the federal 
government began issuing federal notes that were secured not by gold or silver but 
simply by the government’s promise to redeem them. Congress not only authorized 
such bank notes, which came to be known as “ greenbacks ” for their green ink, but 
also declared that they were legal tender, which meant that no one could refuse them 
as payment for goods or debts. Th e result was the creation of a solid monetary system 
that lasted long aft er the war. 
Although there was little fi ghting in the North, families saw sons march off to war 
and oft en received the terrible news that they were never coming home. Death on the 
scale of the Civil War had never been known before—and has not been known since—in 
the United States. Aft er major battles, newspapers and telegraph offi ces posted casualty 
lists. Close comrades or hospital nurses caring for those who died wrote letters to their 
families, and the awful news changed life for those waiting at home. 
In many parts of the North, as in the South, communities were virtually depopulated 
of military-aged men during the war, and women took on roles that they had 
never before considered. Although the prewar North had less rigidly defi ned gender 
roles than the South, changes were signifi cant for many. 
Many Northerners never supported the war eff ort, and their numbers increased 
aft er the Emancipation Proclamation. By 1863, as the death toll rose and the prospects 
of defeating the Confederacy dimmed, the peace faction within the Northern 
Democratic Party grew rapidly, though the party always included not only Peace 
Democrats but also War Democrats who supported the war to save the union if not 
the Emancipation Proclamation. Peace Democrats came to be known as Copperheads, 
aft er Republicans had coined the term, comparing antiwar Democrats to venomous 
snakes. But by 1863, Peace Democrats proudly took up the term and continued to call 
for peace while hoping to make more gains in the state elections of 1863. 
By 1863, Ohio Congressman Clement L. Vallandigham had emerged as the leader of 
the Peace Democrats. For Vallandigham, the result of the war was “defeat, debt, taxation, 
sepulchers.” Vallandigham strongly disapproved of the Emancipation Proclamation, 
declaring that the government should, “look only to the welfare, peace, and safety of 
the white race.” His words touched a nerve in Northern public opinion but did not win 
over a majority. In a May 1863 speech, he said that “King Lincoln” had widened the 
war from one to save the Union to one to free the slaves and must be stopped. General 
Ambrose Burnside, the Union military commander in Ohio, had issued an order that 
“declaring sympathy for the enemy” was against the law. Vallandigham was arrested 
and convicted. Aft er briefl y being jailed, he was exiled to the Confederacy. He met with 
Confederate offi cials in Richmond, then made his way to Canada where, from exile, he 
ran as a Peace Democrat for governor of Ohio in November 1863. Although he lost the 
election, Vallandigham did win 40 percent of the votes. 
New York City was a center of opposition to the war. Its large Irish Catholic 
population had little interest in fi ghting for the rights of African-Americans. More 
free blacks, they thought, meant more competitors on the streets and docks of New 
York, and they did not like it. Aft er Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, 
New York’s Catholic Archbishop John Hughes wrote that “we Catholics…have not 
the slightest idea of carrying on a war that costs so much blood and treasure just to 
gratify a clique of Abolitionists.” 
While Northern support for the abolition of slavery was growing as the war 
progressed, especially among troops in the army, Northern opinion was divided.

Irish Catholics were far from the only people in the North to dislike free blacks and 
have little interest in freeing slaves. As word of the Emancipation Proclamation 
spread in 1862, antiblack riots broke out in several cities, including Cincinnati where 
a strike by Irish dockworkers was defeated with the use of black strikebreakers. In 
Brooklyn, a mob attacked a tobacco factory where blacks were working. 
As opposition grew in the North to the war itself, especially expanding the war 
goals to include emancipation, voluntary enlistment in the army declined. In July 
1863, the government began to enforce a military draft, and the antiblack, anti- 
Abolitionist, antiwar fervor broke into violence. In New York City on July 13, mobs 
attacked the draft offi ces and then turned on black neighborhoods, Republican newspapers, 
and government offi ces. Blacks were beaten, lynched, and shot. Before it was 
over, 105 people, most of them black, were killed. Th e New York Draft Riot was the 
worst riot in American history up to that time. Only the arrival of federal troops on 
July 15, fresh from the Battle of Gettysburg, ended the violence. 
Warfare in the North and West 
Although the Civil War was fought primarily in the South, battles took place in 
distant areas of the nation. A victory at Glorieta Pass near Santa Fe kept New Mexico 
in Union hands. In Missouri, bands loyal to each side fought battles throughout the 
war that spilled over into neighboring states and oft en were fueled by earlier disputes. 
William Clarke Quantrill, who had been among the Missouri “border ruffi ans” in 
the 1850s, led attacks on Union troops and sympathizers in Missouri, and in 1863, 
Quantrill led a band of 450 Southern sympathizers in a raid on Lawrence, Kansas. In 
retaliation for events in “Bleeding Kansas,” Quantrill ordered, “Kill every male and 
burn every house.” Th e band followed orders, killing 183 men and boys and burning 
185 buildings in Lawrence, eluding capture by Union troops. Quantrill was eventually 
killed by Union soldiers, but many of his followers, including Jesse and Frank 
James, became famous outlaws and continued to terrorize parts of the west long aft er 
the war was over. Confederate agents also tried to arrange attacks on the Union from 
Canada and planned an uprising in Chicago during the Democratic convention of 
1864, but nothing came of that eff ort.

Confederate and Union leaders both sought allies among the tribes in Indian 
Territory. Cherokee, Creeks, and Seminoles were all divided between some who 
thought the Confederacy would off er better terms than the United States had done, 
and others who sided with the United States. Even without Confederate infl uence, 
some Northern tribes were angry at the U.S. government over the loss of supplies 
that had been diverted to the war eff ort and over Lincoln’s withdrawal of troops that 
were protecting the tribes from expanding white settlements, as promised in various 
treaties. In Minnesota in August 1862, Santee Sioux under Little Crow killed hundreds 
of white settlers and U.S. troops but were soon defeated. Little Crow along with 
37 other Santee leaders were executed in the largest public hanging in U.S. history. 
Many from the tribe moved to Canada. In early 1863, the Shoshoni under Chief Bear 
Hunter, angry at the growing presence of white settlers and migrants in the tribe’s 
region, attacked white settlements in the Utah and Idaho Territories. Union troops 
retaliated, massacring most of the Shoshoni warriors along with women and children 
in an attack on January 29, 1863. As Indian–white relationships degenerated during 
the war, Union troops were diverted from the war with the Confederacy to fight 
Indians. Indians suff ered no matter which side they took, and most whites looked the 
other way. 
14.3 Quick Review How did political opposition, popular opposition (especially where violent), 
and economic upheaval threaten the war effort in the North and South? 
FROM GETTYSBURG TO APPOMATTOX AND BEYOND 
Analyze the strategies and costs of fi ghting a long and terrible war. 
As both its proponents and opponents understood, the Emancipation Proclamation 
widened the purpose of the Civil War. Military tactics also changed in 1863. Early in 
the war, generals hoped for a short and limited war. McClellan was far from the only 
general, North or South, who tried to avoid large losses of fi ghting troops. By the time 
the war entered its third year, however, military and civilian leaders on both sides had 
concluded that only a much more sustained off ensive would end the war. 
Lincoln relieved several cautious generals—McClellan, Hooker, and Meade— 
before he promoted Grant to overall command. Davis, on the other hand, promoted 
Lee to be the top military commander early in the war. In Grant and Lee, each 
president had selected a general who was willing to fi ght a large-scale off ensive war 
and absorb large troop losses to win. 
Gettysburg and the War in Pennsylvania and Virginia 
In spring of 1863, Hooker, while he was still in command, marched Union troops into 
Virginia, and the two armies fought for 7 days at Chancellorsville. When Stonewall 
Jackson led his troops around the end of the Union lines, Hooker lost his nerve and 
ordered a retreat. Chancellorsville was a major Confederate victory, though it came 
at the high cost of 10,000 Confederate dead and wounded and 14,000 Union losses. 
In the battle, Jackson was accidentally shot by his own troops and died a week later. 
Lincoln relieved Hooker of command and appointed General George Meade to replace 
Hooker. Meanwhile, Lee convinced Davis that the time had come to invade the North, 
cut Washington, DC, off from the rest of the country, and end the war. 
June 1863 was the high point of Confederate confi dence and Confederate advances. 
As Lee led the South’s largest army through rural Pennsylvania, many in the North— 
not just the unfortunate inhabitants of the towns through which the army marched— 
grew fearful. If the Confederate army could control the Pennsylvania countryside,

they could attack Philadelphia or Washington as a well-fed, well-organized army of 
conquest. Th e North could not continue the war if its capital and major cities were 
under rebel control. 
Long before any battles took place, Pennsylvania residents knew one was coming. 
While people living in many parts of the South had already experienced 2 years of war, 
such fears were new north of the Mason-Dixon line. Philip Schaff , a theologian and 
historian teaching at Mercersburg Seminary in Pennsylvania, remembered that trying 
times did not bring out the best in frightened and confused people. Th ey turned on 
their neighbors because of pro- or antiwar politics or over squabbles about what to 
hide and where to hide it. 
When the rebel army did arrive, Mercersburg was luckier than some towns, at least 
for its white citizens. General Lee ordered that “no private property shall be injured 
or destroyed.” Schaff described the fi rst Confederate offi cer he met as “intelligent and 
courteous, but full of hatred for the Yankees.” Not all the Confederates who followed 
were as polite. 
Mercersburg had a large free black population, and they suff ered far worse than 
whites. Schaff said that some of the troops went “on a regular slave-hunt, which 
presented the worst spectacle I ever saw in this war.” When white households hid 
black friends, the invading troops “proclaimed, fi rst, that they would burn down every 
house which harbored a fugitive slave.” And they considered all blacks to be fugitive 
slaves. Schaff was terrifi ed that his servant Eliza and her son would be found. Th ey 
escaped, but other blacks in the town were caught and sold into slavery. For blacks and 
whites, southern Pennsylvania in 1863 was every bit as much a war zone as Virginia or 
the Mississippi River valley had been in 1862. 
Lincoln and Meade ordered the Army of the Potomac to stop Lee’s advance at all 
cost. Th e Northern and Southern armies found each other near the town of Gettysburg, 
Pennsylvania. On July 1, Confederate forces drove Union troops out of the town and 
onto Cemetery Hill. Th e next morning, Lee ordered a major attack, but the Union 
army held its ground. Aft er another major charge directly at the heart of the Union 
lines on July 3—known as Pickett’s Charge for the offi cer commanding the lead unit— 
it became clear to Lee that, despite terrible losses, the Union forces, now reinforced, 
could not be dislodged. Of the 14,000 soldiers that Pickett led in the assault, only 
half returned. Confederate General Longstreet spoke of the Battle of Gettysburg as 
“hopeless slaughter…one of the saddest [days] of my life.” In the 3 days at Gettysburg,

51,000 soldiers were killed or wounded, 23,000 from the North and 28,000 from the 
South. On July 4, Lee began a painful retreat back to Virginia. Th e Confederate army 
would never again be a major presence in the North. Lincoln, however, was furious 
that Meade, like McClellan, did not pursue the retreating Confederates. 
While news was arriving in Washington that the Confederate forces had been 
turned back, word also came of a second Northern victory. Unable to defeat the 
Confederate garrison at Vicksburg in 1862, Grant surrounded the city and starved 
it. Aft er holding on for a year, on July 4, 1863, the Confederate forces at Vicksburg 
surrendered. Watching the Union army march into Vicksburg, a local resident wrote, 
“What a contrast [these] stalwart, well-fed men…[were to]…the worn men in gray, 
who were being blindly dashed against this embodiment of modern power.” The 
entire Mississippi River was now under Union control. Th e Confederacy had been 
cut in half. Lincoln made Grant General-in-Chief of all Union armies. But it would 
be another hard year before there was another Northern victory like Gettysburg or 
Vicksburg and 2 years before the war ended. 
The Terrible Cost of War 
In early 1864, Grant took direct command in the East and marched into Virginia to 
attack Lee. He quickly stalled. In early May 1864 at the Battle of the Wilderness, Southern 
forces mounted a furious attack with high casualties. Neither side won the Battle of 
the Wilderness, but unlike his predecessors, Grant pursued the Confederate forces

Gettysburg, Pa., July 7th, 1863 Wall Street, Half Past Two O’Clock, 
October 13, 1857 by James H. Cafferty and Charles G. Rosenberg 
Dear Cousin 
I am very tired tonight; have been on the field all day— 
went to the 3rd Division 2nd Army Corps. I suppose there are 
about five hundred wounded belonging to it.…There are no 
words in the English language to express the sufferings I witnessed 
today. The men lie on the ground; their clothes have 
been cut off them to dress their wounds; they are half naked, 
have nothing but hardtack to eat only as Sanitary Commissions, 
Christian Associations, and so forth give them. I was the first 
woman who reached the 2nd Corps after the three days fight at 
Gettysburg. I was in the Corps all day, not another woman within 
a half mile.…To give you some idea of the extent and numbers 
of the sounds, four surgeons, none of whom were idle fifteen 
minutes of time, were busy all day amputating legs and arms. 
I gave to every man that had a leg or arm off a gill of wine, to 
every wounded in the Third Division, one glass of lemonade, 
some bread and preserves and tobacco. 
I feel very thankful that this was a successful battle; the spirit 
of the men is so high that many of the poor fellows said today, 
“What is an arm or leg to whipping Lee out of Penn.” I would get 
on first rate if they would not ask me to write to their wives; that 
I cannot do without crying, which is not pleasant to either party. 
I do not mind the sight of blood, have seen limbs taken off and 
was not sick at all. 
It is a very beautiful, rolling country here; under favorable 
circumstances I should think healthy, but now for five miles 
around, there is an awful smell of putrefaction. Women 
are needed here very badly, anyone who is willing to go to 
field hospitals.

aft er the battle. At the end of May, Union forces took control of the crossroads town of 
Cold Harbor, Virginia, but Confederate forces attacked, and Grant ordered a counterattack. 
Th e armies fought along a line from Cold Harbor to the Chickahominy River. 
In this case, even Grant thought the cost too high. Wounded soldiers could not escape 
fi res that roared through the thick undergrowth, and the suff ering was terrible. He wrote 
in his Memoirs that this attack was the only one he wished he had never ordered. Th e 
Union lost 13,000 troops to the Confederate 2,500. In spite of the terrible losses, Grant 
still did not retreat. 
In June 1864, Grant attacked Petersburg, then the second largest city in Virginia, 
and settled down for a siege. Grant telegraphed Lincoln, “I propose to fi ght it out on 
this line if it takes all summer.” It was what Lincoln wanted from a general. But while 
Grant was not retreating, he was not making much progress either. Some newspapers 
began to call Grant a “butcher.” Others just wondered if the war would ever end. 
At least three factors now caused the Civil War’s high death toll. Lee and Grant 
had shift ed tactics from a limited war to a war of attrition. Each army meant to destroy 
the other, killing and wounding as many soldiers as possible. Aft er 1863, there were 
no more limited engagements. Weapons were also deadlier than anything used in 
previous wars. Finally, medicine was still in its infancy. Th e wounded oft en died from 
infections that only a few years later a new generation knew how to treat. Given all 
three factors, grieving became part of life, for troops and for families at home. 
Before the Civil War, armies fought with muskets, which took time to load and 
were not that accurate. Most military authorities in prior wars agreed that the best 
way to attack was in a close-order formation in which a well-trained army marched 
forward shooting, reloading, and shooting again. If both sides had muskets, the 
inaccuracy and short range of the weapons reduced the danger to any one soldier. 
Th at strategy was what had been taught at West Point where most senior offi cers of 
both the North and the South had been trained. 
But the close-order formation was a virtual death sentence to troops facing an 
army with rifl es. Th e new rifl es, developed in France and by the American James H. 
Burton at the federal armory at Harper’s Ferry in the 1850s, increased the distance 
that a soldier could shoot four-fold, and the spin a rifl e gave to a bullet meant that 
it did a lot more damage to the human body. By 1863, Union factories developed 
repeating rifles that made the firepower of these weapons much faster and more 
deadly. Th e accuracy of rifl es also meant that opponents could identify offi cers and 
shoot them, a reason why so many generals were killed in the war and why generals, 
like Grant, began wearing private’s uniforms. Th e South never matched the North 
in weapons production, and many of its new weapons were either captured or came 
from blockade runners. Th e South’s slow production of rifl es was one reason it suffered 
more casualties than the North. 
Artillery also became a key defensive weapon in the Civil War. New cannons that 
fi red grapeshot and canister, rather than old fashioned cannon balls, were like giant shotguns. 
Defending armies in the Civil War could shoot down row aft er row of attackers. 
A Union cavalry offi cer described the results of these new weapons in combat. In 
July 1862, the morning aft er Confederate army units attacked Union placements at 
Malvern Hill, Virginia, he said, “Our eyes saw an appalling spectacle upon the slopes 
down to the woodlands half a mile away. Over five thousand dead and wounded 
men were on the ground…enough were alive and moving to give the fi eld a singular 
crawling eff ect.” Th at result is what the new weapons of war did to people. 
Medicine, Nursing, and a New Role for Women 
Many of those wounded in the Civil War died because of a lack of eff ective medical 
treatment. Indeed, more soldiers died of diseases during the war than died in combat. 
It was just aft er the war that European researchers Louis Pasteur and Joseph Lister 
developed modern bacteriology. No Civil War doctor, North or South, knew that

microbes in contaminated water or on hands or unsterilized instruments caused 
infection, or that mosquitoes could be as dangerous to troops as enemy bullets. 
Antiseptics did not exist. Medical education was primitive. 
Military camps, where large numbers of men lived in close and oft en unsanitary 
quarters, were breeding grounds for disease. Many soldiers thought that it was 
better to avoid a physician than get close to one. Soldiers North and South agreed 
with the Alabama soldier who wrote that “I believe the Doctors kill more than they 
cour [cure]” and with the Massachusetts offi cer who said that the regimental surgeon 
was “a jackass.” 
To fill gaps in medical care, women began to nurse the wounded and the sick. 
Before the war, nursing had been almost exclusively men’s work. But now the men 
were fi ghting, and the women were determined to aid the cause for which sons, husbands, 
and lovers were risking their lives. In the North, the United States Sanitary 
Commission became a powerful voluntary women’s organization that was able to 
brush aside the army Medical Bureau and take on everything from raising money for 
medical supplies to providing nurses in fi eld hospitals. 
Elizabeth Blackwell, the first American woman M.D., began organizing the 
Sanitary Commission in 1861 and with widespread support, most of all from the 
troops whom its nurses aided, it fl ourished despite hostility from male army physicians. 
Th e reformer and social worker Dorothea Dix was named “Superintendent of Female 
Nurses.” By the end of the war, Dix had organized 3,000 Northern women volunteers 
to serve as army nurses in addition to others who were paid directly by the Sanitary 
Commission. Still other women, most notably Clara Barton, who later helped create 
the American Red Cross, became free-agent nurses, helping wherever they could. 
Mary Ann Bickerdyke began serving as a nurse at Cairo, Illinois, and followed Grant’s 
and Sherman’s armies across the South. Mother Bickerdyke, as the troops called her, 
was the only woman Sherman authorized to serve in his advanced base hospitals. 
Women in the South took up similar duties, often despite greater hostility. 
Southern culture, even more than Northern, treated middle-class white women 
as in need of constant protection. Moving into a hospital as a nurse was hardly 
protected work, and it brought women into close contact with male bodies, something

previously thought improper. But the sick were there, and the women were determined 
to help. Th e Confederate Baptist off ered religious sanction for this new role 
for women saying that “they are most valuable auxiliaries.” In spite of concerns about 
“delicacy,” “modesty,” and “refi nement,” women went to work as nurses in the South. 
Sara Agnes Pryor, who had lived in comfort before the war, volunteered to help in 
Virginia hospitals. When she saw a nurse kneeling to hold the stump of an amputated 
arm she fainted and thought she was wholly “unfi t for the work.” But Pryor overcame 
her “fi ne-lady faintness” and became a serious professional. Mary Rutledge Fogg was 
from one of the South’s grand families in Nashville, and she used her status to pressure 
Jeff erson Davis to allow her to start military hospitals in Nashville, Memphis, and 
Knoxville aft er seeing “50 brave soldiers” die “for the want of proper nurses.” Phoebe 
Yates Levy Pember, a 40-year-old widow, was named matron of the Confederate hospital 
in Richmond where she and her sisters provided for the hundreds of wounded 
soldiers who streamed into the Confederate capital. 
Women nurses, North and South, looked to their hero Florence Nightingale, the 
English woman who had virtually invented modern nursing while serving British 
troops in the 1853–1856 Crimean War. And, like Nightingale, the nurses of the Civil 
War sought to bring healing to wounded soldiers as well as comfort to the dying and 
those who were recovering. 
Presidential Politics and Sherman’s March to the Sea, Then North 
While women like Pryor and Barton tried to comfort the wounded, soldiers 
fought, and Grant held his line in Virginia, it was not clear whether Lincoln could 
hold his office. Continuing losses, lack of progress at Petersburg, and hostility to 
emancipation all combined to strengthen the chances of the Copperhead antiwar 
Democrats in the 1864 presidential election. None were more aware of this situation 
than the leaders of the Confederacy. Lee knew he could not hold Petersburg 
forever, but he was confident that all he needed to do was hold the city until the 
November elections. If Grant made no progress, and casualties remained high, 
Lee and Davis thought that the Copperhead Democrats would win the election 
and make peace. 
While the Democrats grew stronger, many Republicans were losing heart by 
1864. Congressman Martin F. Conway, a Republican from Kansas who had once 
criticized Lincoln for pursuing the war too slowly, now asked the president, “For 
god’s sake try and arrange [peace] with the South…. Th e war-spirit is gone.” When 
in August 1864 the Democrats nominated General McClellan, whom Lincoln had 
fi red for being too cautious, Lincoln expected to be a one-term president. His only 
hope, he wrote, was “to save the Union between the election and the inauguration” 
that would take place in March 1865. Th en, the picture on the battlefi eld changed 
dramatically (see Map 14-2 ). 
When Grant had come east to fight in Virginia, he left his closest subordinate 
William T. Sherman in charge in the west. Sherman began a march across the heart 
of the Confederacy. Just as the Mississippi River campaign had cut the Confederacy 
in half from north to south, Sherman aimed to cut it in half from west to east. Slowly, 
avoiding major confrontations and keeping a careful eye on his supply trains, Sherman 
led his army, moving from Tennessee across Mississippi, Alabama, and into Georgia. 
Sherman saw little value or glory in winning battles. He said that glory in war, “is all 
moonshine; even success the most brilliant is over dead and mangled bodies, with 
the anguish and lamentation of distant families.” Sherman just kept maneuvering and 
kept marching, fi ghting when necessary. 
Confederate General John Bell Hood tried to stop Sherman before he reached 
Atlanta, an important railroad center. In August 1864, Sherman changed course, and 
the Confederate general thought Sherman was retreating, but Sherman won the next 
battle on August 30. Th e Confederates then evacuated Atlanta and burned most of

the city. On September 1, Sherman led his troops into Atlanta. Mary Boykin Chesnut 
wrote in her diary, “Since Atlanta I have felt as if all were dead within me, forever. 
We are going to be wiped off the earth.” 
As Sherman was taking Atlanta, Admiral Farragut led a daring raid on Mobile 
Bay, Alabama. Confederate forts guarded the harbor and well-placed mines (known 
then as torpedoes) blocked the entrance. When the lead ship in Farragut’s fl eet was 
sunk by an exploding mine, the fl eet stopped. Farragut, in one of the war’s immortal

phrases ordered, “Damn the torpedoes! Full speed ahead.” Farragut’s fl eet won control 
of Mobile’s harbor. While Mobile, which was more inland, remained in Confederate 
hands, the port, which had been an essential base for Confederate blockade runners, 
was under Union control by the end of August 1864, adding one more link in the 
Union chain encircling the Confederacy. 
Sherman’s taking of Atlanta and Farragut’s victory at Mobile Bay were important 
military victories, but they were also political victories for Lincoln and psychological 
victories for the North. Lincoln grew optimistic. Secretary of State Seward said, 
“Sherman and Farragut have knocked the bottom out of the” Democrats. Frederick 
Douglass, who had wanted a stronger abolitionist at the head of the 1864 Republican 
ticket, now said that “all hesitation ought to cease” regarding support for the president. 
Lincoln insisted that if he were reelected, the government must be based on “liberty 
and equality…an open fi eld and a fair chance…in the race of life.” Even the Democrat 
nominee McClellan shift ed his tone, insisting that negotiations with the South be “on 
the basis of the Union,” angering Copperhead/Peace Democrats who wanted peace on 
any terms. In November, Lincoln defeated McClellan by 2,220,846 popular votes to 
1,809,445, ensuring Lincoln 212 electoral votes to McClellan’s 21. 
After the capture of Atlanta, no one was sure what Sherman would do next. His 
supply lines were stretched to the limit. In response, Sherman proposed to cut his army 
loose from supply lines entirely, live off the land, and march his 62,000 toughened troops 
straight through the heart of the Confederacy. Lincoln and Grant agreed. Th ere would be 
little armed resistance, Sherman argued, since the Confederate army was fi ghting in the 
North, not protecting the Confederate heartland, which they presumed was safe. 
Sherman believed that “[w]ar is cruelty and you cannot refi ne it.” On November 15, 
he started his “march to the sea,” destroying every farm, factory, and railroad in his 
path. Troops destroyed all that the army could not eat or use. In Milledgeville, Georgia, 
then the state capital, Sherman’s troops met Union prisoners who had escaped from 
the notorious Southern prison camp at Andersonville. Some Union prisoners at 
Andersonville had spent years with only the barest rations, and their uniforms had 
turned to shreds. Many died there. Th e sight of these emaciated soldiers wearing rags 
“sickened and infuriated” the Northern soldiers. Along the way, escaping slaves and 
Southern white Unionists joined the march. Sherman captured Savannah, Georgia, 
on the Atlantic coast in late December. His telegram to President Lincoln said, “I beg 
to present you, as a Christmas gift , the city of Savannah, with 150 heavy guns and… 
about 25,000 bales of cotton.” 
In January 1865, Sherman started north through Georgia and the Carolinas. His 
goal was to attack Lee’s army from the south while Grant attacked from the north. 
Sherman continued to destroy any of the South’s resources for waging war, including 
food. When the army reached South Carolina, one Union soldier said, “Here is where 
treason began and, by God, here is where it shall end!” Sherman seemed to agree, and 
another soldier said that by the time the army was through, South Carolina “will never 
want to secede again.” Every house they encountered was burned, and every village 
stripped of supplies. Sherman left the coast of South Carolina to others—and it was 
probably the good fortune of Charleston to be occupied by troops from the Union’s 
Department of the South, including many black units, who saved the city. Sherman’s 
army then marched inland to the state’s capitol of Columbia, which was burned to the 
ground. When the army reached the North Carolina border, the burning stopped. But 
in South Carolina, the march left a trail of anger and resentment that lasted for generations 
as it demoralized a population that was already losing faith in the war. 
The Road to Appomattox and Peace 
Before Sherman could fi nish his march through North Carolina and into Virginia, 
other events began turning in Grant’s favor. As news of Lincoln’s November reelection, 
the capture of Savannah, and the destruction in South Carolina began to sink in, many

in the South began to lose hope. In early 1865, Lee even began recruiting black soldiers 
with the promise of freedom for them, though not the end of slavery for others. By 
March 1865, Lee knew his army could not stay at Petersburg. 
The retreat of the remaining Army of Northern Virginia out of Petersburg left 
Richmond open to attack. On April 2, while Jeff erson Davis sat in Sunday morning 
services in Richmond, a messenger gave him a telegram. Many in the congregation

Battle Signifi cance 
Fort Sumter 
Charleston, South Carolina 
April 12–13, 1861 
The firing on the federal garrison by Confederate forces was the 
opening of the war. 
Bull Run or First Manassas 
Fairfax and Prince William Counties, Virginia 
July 21, 1861 
Union forces marching south from Washington, DC, were met 
by Confederates at Bull Run Creek. Many Northerners expected 
a short skirmish and then a march to Richmond, but the 
Confederates turned the tide, and Union soldiers retreated back to 
Washington, DC. 
New Orleans, Louisiana 
April 23–28, 1862 
U.S. Navy ships under David G. Farragut took New Orleans, the 
largest city in the South, which remained in Union hands for the 
duration of the war. 
Second Battle of Bull Run or Second Manassas 
August 28–30, 1862 
The battle was a major Confederate victory and ended Northern 
hopes for an easy attack on the Confederate capital. 
Antietam or Sharpsburg 
Washington County, Maryland 
September 16–18, 1862 
Lee marched into Maryland but was stopped in a fierce battle at 
Antietam. 
Lincoln was furious that McClellan did not pursue Lee on his retreat 
into Virginia. 
Fredericksburg, Virginia 
December 13, 1862 
Union General Ambrose Burnside led an attack on the town as a 
first step toward attacking the Confederate capital of Richmond but 
was defeated by a well-defended force commanded by Robert E. 
Lee. The U.S. Army lost 13,000 troops, mostly in ill-conceived direct 
attacks while the Confederates lost 5,000. Northern morale sank. 
Chancellorsville 
Spotsylvania County, Virginia 
April 30–May 6, 1863 
A Union army led by General Joseph Hooker was defeated by 
a Confederate force, leading to a major incursion north of the 
Mason-Dixon line that threatened Washington, DC. 
Gettysburg, Pennsylvania 
July 1–3, 1863 
The bloodiest battle of the war led to Lee’s withdrawal back to 
Virginia, ending the threat to Washington, DC. 
Vicksburg, Mississippi 
May 18–July 4, 1863 
Union troops commanded by Ulysses S. Grant finally took control of 
the Mississippi River from St. Louis to New Orleans and thus cut the 
Confederacy in half while securing easy access into the interior of 
the Confederacy. 
Wilderness 
Spotsylvania County, Virginia 
May 5–7, 1864 
Lincoln placed Grant in charge of all U.S. forces, and Grant led 
a bloody drive into Virginia. The first battle took place in deep 
woods (hence the Wilderness), and Grant—unlike previous Union 
generals—simply kept going. 
Cold Harbor, Virginia 
May 31–June 12, 1864 
Grant attacked the Confederate army and took horrible casualties. 
In his Memoirs , Grant wrote that this was the one attack he wished 
he had never ordered. 
Atlanta, Georgia 
September 2, 1864 
William T. Sherman led 62,000 troops into Georgia, defeating 
Confederate forces and taking Atlanta. Sherman’s army then began 
its “march to the sea” taking Savannah on December 21 before 
running north and attacking Confederate forces in South and North 
Carolina. 
Mobile Bay, Alabama 
August 2–23, 1864 
U.S. Admiral David G. Farragut effectively ended blockade running 
out of Mobile, depriving the South of badly needed supplies. 
Appomattox Court House, Virginia

thought they knew what it meant when Davis slipped out. All Sunday aft ernoon, the 
leaders of the Confederate government moved out of Richmond, taking what records, 
gold, and materials they could and burning the rest. By evening, mobs had replaced 
the government. Th e next morning, the Union army marched into Richmond, not to 
burn the city but to put out the fi res that the retreating Confederates had started. Th e 
day aft er that, President Lincoln, with only a small guard of sailors, came to Richmond, 
sat at Davis’s old desk, and greeted former slaves who were shouting “Glory to God!” 
and “Bless the Lord!” When one former slave knelt at Lincoln’s feet the president said, 
“Don’t kneel to me. Th at is not right.” 
Davis fl ed south from Richmond to Danville where he announced that “nothing 
is now needed to render our triumph certain, but…our own unquenchable resolve.” 
But resolve was melting. Lee’s troops were weak from lack of food. He tried one 
last attack on April 9, and when that failed, sent word to Grant that he was ready to 
surrender. Th e two generals—Grant and Lee—met in Wilmer McLean’s living room 
in Appomattox, Virginia, that aft ernoon. Grant remembered the encounter. “We soon 
fell into a conversation about old army times.…Our conversation grew so pleasant that 
I almost forgot the object of our meeting.” But when Lee turned back to the matter at 
hand, Grant wrote out the terms of surrender. He allowed the Confederate soldiers to 
keep their horses and mules with them to help in planting crops for the year ahead, 
and Lee noted that “this would have a happy eff ect.”

WHAT BROUGHT THE 
UNITED STATES TO THE 
CIVIL WAR? 
By 1860, the United States was divided 
between North and South, a divergence 
centered on the issue of slavery. Other 
elements, however, also separated the two 
sides. The South was mostly agricultural and 
rural compared to the far more urbanized 
and industrialized North. By 1861, the two 
sides were in the Civil War as 11 southern 
states had seceded as the Confederacy. A 
bloody confl ict ensued that lasted until 
1865 and cost more American lives than any 
other U.S. war before or since. The Union 
eventually won, bolstered by its economic 
advantages, but only after the deaths of 
752,000 men.

Grant arranged for Lee’s starving army to receive military rations. At 4:30 p.m., 
Grant telegraphed Secretary of War Stanton, that “General Lee surrendered the Army 
of Northern Virginia this aft ernoon.” Th e long and terrible war essentially over. Grant 
wrote of a sense of sadness “at the downfall of a foe who had fought so long and 
valiantly, and had suff ered so much for a cause, though that cause was, I believe, one 
of the worst for which a people ever fought.” 
Lee’s surrender did not quite end the war. Jeff erson Davis fl ed south, hoping to 
regroup his government, perhaps in Texas, until he was captured in Georgia on May 
10. He was held in custody for 2 years at Fortress Monroe before being released on 
bail. Davis was indicted for treason, but the charges were never pressed, although 
he was barred from ever holding a federal offi ce again. During the next 2 decades, 
he tried various business ventures and wrote his defense of the cause he had led. 
Isolated Confederate units carried on the fi ght in remote areas, especially Texas, 
until May. But aft er the April 9 surrender at Appomattox, almost everyone knew 
that the war was over. Washington, DC, was draped with fl ags, people fi red salutes, 
embraced, and sang. Soldiers on both sides found their weary way home. Th ose in 
the North were welcomed with grand parades; most of those in the South simply 
made it home. 
Lincoln’s Legacy 
On January 31, 1865, even before Lee’s surrender, the House of Representatives voted 
119 to 56 to add a Th irteenth Amendment to the Constitution: 
Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for a crime 
whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United 
States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction. 
Th e fl oor of the House and visitors watching in the gallery erupted into cheers and 
applause. Many of those in the gallery were African-Americans; people who had 
not been even admitted to the House gallery until 1864. The Senate and the states 
quickly followed, and the amendment became part of the Constitution on December 
18, 1865. Th e war that began over slavery ended with its abolition in every part of the 
United States. 
After visiting Richmond, Virginia, on April 4 and 5 and receiving the news of 
Lee’s surrender on April 9, President Lincoln gave what came to be known as his 
“last speech” at the White House on April 11, 1865. Of course, he did not know 
it was to be his last. Reviewing the president’s speech, the New York World said, 
“Mr. Lincoln gropes…like a traveler in an unknown country without a map.” 
In fact, the administration, the Congress, and the country were all groping to find 
their way through several extraordinarily difficult issues as the Civil War ended. 
Among the most contentious were those related to defining the rights of newly 
freed slaves: Did they have the right to vote? Did they have other political rights? 
Did they have a right to some of the land they had worked for so long? There were 
equally contentious arguments about the rights of the former Confederate states: 
Had they actually left the Union, in which case, did they needed to be readmitted, 
perhaps after a time as territories? Or had they never left the Union, in which 
case, could they could simply renew their place in the country and make their 
own laws? No one really knew the answers or how to get answers. As Lincoln 
said on April 11, “Unlike a case of a war between independent nations, there is 
no authorized organ for us to treat with. No one man has authority to give up 
the rebellion for any other man. We simply must begin with, and mold from, 
disorganized and discordant elements.” 
Lincoln also called the question of whether the Confederate states had left 
the Union a “pernicious abstraction.” He did not want to debate whether the

states had really left the Union and therefore needed to be readmitted or whether 
they had simply been “in rebellion” and therefore, with the end of the rebellion, 
were back in their old places. The issue for him, he said, was much simpler: 
“We all agree that the seceded States, so called, are out of their proper practical 
relation with the Union; and that the sole object of the government, civil and 
military, in regard to those States is to again get them into that proper practical 
relation.” In fact, the issue was not so simple. If the states had actually left 
the Union, then Congress could impose conditions on their readmission such as 
granting blacks the right to vote. If they had never left, then it was more difficult 
to impose such conditions. 
In April 1865, Lincoln began to give more attention to the postwar era. Some 
thought he had decided that guaranteeing former slaves the right to vote should 
be a key element in the integration of the Confederate states back into the Union, 
but he did not announce his policy. On the morning of April 14, he met with the 
cabinet to discuss what he was now calling “reconstruction.” He directed Secretary 
As Lincoln took the oath of office for the second time, everyone 
knew that the Civil War was about to end. No one, of 
course, knew that the president had only weeks to live. But it 
was the occasion of one of the most memorable speeches in 
American history. Lincoln said: 
On the occasion corresponding to this four years ago, all 
thoughts were anxiously directed to an impending civil war. 
All dreaded it—all sought to avert it.…Both parties deprecated 
war; but one of them would make war rather than let the nation 
survive; and the other would accept war rather than let it perish. 
And the war came. 
One eighth of the whole population were colored slaves, 
not distributed generally over the Union, but localized in the 
Southern part of it. These slaves constituted a peculiar and 
powerful interest. All knew that this interest was, somehow, the 
cause of the war. To strengthen, perpetuate, and extend this 
interest was the object for which the insurgents would rend the 
Union, even by war; while the government claimed no right to 
do more than to restrict the territorial enlargement of it. Neither 
party expected for the war, the magnitude, or the duration, 
which it has already attained. Neither anticipated that the cause 
of the conflict might cease with, or even before, the conflict itself 
should cease. Each looked for an easier triumph, and a result 
less fundamental and astounding. Both read the same Bible, 
and pray to the same God; and each invokes His aid against the 
other. It may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a 
just God’s assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of 
other men’s faces; but let us judge not that we be not judged. 
The prayers of both could not be answered; that of neither has 
been answered fully.…Fondly do we hope—fervently do we 
pray—that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. 
Yet, if God wills that it continue, until all the wealth piled by the 
bond-man’s two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall 
be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash, shall 
be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three 
thousand years ago, so still it must be said “the judgments of the 
Lord, are true and righteous altogether.” 
With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in 
the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish 
the work we are in; to bind up the nation’s wounds; to care for 
him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his 
orphan—to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting 
peace, among ourselves, and with all nations.

14.4 Quick Review How was the violence of the Civil War different from other wars in which the 
United States was involved? 
CONCLUSION 
When the Civil War began in 1861, people North and South hoped for and 
expected a short and limited war, but it was not to be. Four years of terrible violence 
would follow. 
When the first calls for troops were issued, enthusiastic young men signed 
up for service in the Union and Confederate armies, anxious not to miss out 
on the adventure and glory that they were sure would come in a short and easy 
war. But attitudes changed quickly. In the first significant battle of the war, at 
Bull Run Creek near Manassas, Virginia, in July 1861 tourists from Washington, 
DC, accompanied Union forces to watch what they were sure would be an easy 
victory. But in spite of early predictions, Confederate forces turned the tide and 
the Union army and their visitors were quickly driven back to the relative safety 
of the nation’s capital. 
In spite of early successes by the U.S. Navy in blockading many Southern ports 
and in opening up portions of the Mississippi River to Union forces, President 
Lincoln soon became convinced that the nation was in for a long and bloody 
war and began looking for a general who had the tenacity to lead troops to a 
convincing victory. But through 1861, 1862, and 1863, in spite of bloody battles— 
a second one at Bull Run in August 1862 followed by the bloodiest day of the 
war at Antietam, Maryland, that September; further battles at Fredericksburg, 
Virginia, in December; then Chancellorsville, Virginia, in April 1863; and 
Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, that July—the war seemed to have no conclusive end 
in sight. Battles took place as far away as Missouri, New Mexico, and Minnesota, 
some with western Indian tribes angry at expanding white settlement and some 
between Northern and Southern sympathizers. Many, North and South, began to 
lose hope. 
In the North, Peace Democrats, soon calling themselves Copperheads, began to 
campaign for an end to the war and for letting the South go its own way. Th e New 
York Draft Riots of July 1863 illustrated the way many white immigrants in that 
city had little interest in fi ghting a war and, indeed, blamed local blacks—whom 
they attacked across the city—for causing their troubles. At the same time, in the 
South, starvation spread, and Southern cities, including the Confederate capital of 
Richmond, Virginia, were wracked with bread riots. 
While others debated, however, black and white abolitionists knew exactly what 
they wanted from the war—an end to slavery everywhere in the United States. From 
the earliest days of the war, abolitionists had urged Lincoln to use his war powers to 
free all slaves, and some, like the former slave Frederick Douglass, insisted that the 
14.4 
14.1 

Chapter 14 And the War Came: The Civil War 443 
only terms on which the war could be won and the nation united was the complete 
abolition of the institution of slavery that had led to war in the fi rst place. Finally, 
in the fall of 1862, aft er more than a year of caution, President Lincoln decided 
to act and on January 1, 1863, signed the Emancipation Proclamation, freeing all 
slaves in the rebellious states and calling on former slaves to enlist in the Union 
army. Former slaves who had been fl ocking to Union posts now joined the army 
and quickly attained equality with white soldiers as well as a reputation for valor 
that impressed many. 
Still the war itself continued. Women, North and South, became nurses— 
a previously all-male profession—to help the wounded and suff ering soldiers. In 
1863, aft er the Union army’s victory at Vicksburg on the Mississippi River, Lincoln 
selected Ulysses S. Grant after searching for a general who had the determination 
to do what had to be done to win the war. Grant began a series of attacks 
on Confederate forces in Virginia in an effort to both defeat the main body of 
the Confederate army and take the Confederate capital of Richmond. At the 
same time, Grant’s former deputy, William T. Sherman, began a march across 
the South, from the Mississippi River to Atlanta, Georgia, and then a “march to 
the sea” that captured the port city of Savannah, Georgia, in December, 1864. As 
1865 began, Sherman’s army turned north, marching through the Carolinas to 
attack Virginia from the south while Grant’s army had new victories in Virginia. 
Finally on April 9, 1865, the main Confederate army commanded by Robert E. Lee 
surrendered to Grant. Th e Civil War was over. Days later, President Lincoln, who 
was just beginning to turn his attention to what might come next, was assassinated. 
Th e rebuilding of the country would be in other hands.

Explain how the early battles of the war shaped future events. 
Summary 
Once Fort Sumter had been fi red on, large numbers of volunteers 
joined the army on both sides. Th e fi rst signifi cant battle 
of the war, the Battle of Manassas or Bull Run, was a clearcut 
Confederate victory. Aft er Bull Run, Lincoln prepared for 
a much larger and longer war than most had originally envisioned. 
Th e South pinned its hopes on a defensive strategy and 
the intervention of the British on the Southern side. Th e North 
was slow to bring its advantages in men and resources to bear 
on the fi ght. Union naval forces blockaded the South and took 
control of major river systems, undermining its economy and 
limiting its ability to move troops and supplies. Th e bloody battles 
of 1862, most notably Shiloh and Antietam, did not provide 
either side with a decisive breakthrough.

Analyze how the war infl uenced attitudes toward slavery in

Summary 
During his presidential campaign and throughout the early 
years of the war, Lincoln insisted that he had no intent to interfere 
with slavery where it already existed. Th e realities of war, 
including large numbers of escaped slaves who sought the 
protection of the Union forces, complicated the issue. As the 
war dragged on, Lincoln began to change his mind about his 
approach to the issue of slavery. At the same time, antislavery 
sentiment in the North grew. By September of 1862, Lincoln 
was ready to move forward on emancipation. On January 1, 
1863, the Emancipation Proclamation went into effect. The 
Emancipation Proclamation freed slaves in Confederate territories 
and allowed blacks to serve in the Northern military. More 
than 180,000 black soldiers eventually fought for the Union, 
most of them recently emancipated slaves but some long-time 
free blacks.

its problems simply by printing more money. Th e disruption 
of Southern transportation led to uneven distribution of food 
and other resources. Managing these home-front diffi culties in 
the South fell primarily to women. Women were forced to take

major role in delivering medical care to the troops. Th e capture 
of Atlanta and Mobile by the Union secured Lincoln’s victory in 
the election of 1864. Sherman’s “march to the sea” was meant 
to devastate the South’s economy and undermine Southern 
morale. By early 1865, the South was all but defenseless, and 
Lee surrendered to Grant in April 1865. 
In January 1865, Congress voted to add the Thirteenth 
Amendment to the Constitution, ending slavery, and it was 
ratifi ed in December of the same year. On June 19, 1865, based 
on the Emancipation Proclamation, the end of slavery was proclaimed 
in Texas, the last state to halt resistance to the Union. 
Slaves had long been emancipating themselves by the time the 
war ended. With the war over, former slaves began to explore the 
meaning of freedom. At the same time, the federal government 
grappled with the diffi cult issues that arose once the war was 
over, including the status of newly freed slaves and the readmission 
of Confederate states into the Union. Lincoln hesitated to 
take a clear stand on the connection between the status of newly 
freed slaves and the readmission of Confederate states. Lincoln’s 
assassination meant that the challenges of Reconstruction 
would fall to Congress and President Andrew Johnson.

Summary 
In 1863, military tactics underwent profound changes as the 
Union abandoned hopes of a short and limited war. The war 
became one of attrition. Th e Confederates enjoyed some success 
in the beginning of 1863, but the tide turned in July, with 
Union victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg. Aft er these two 
battles, the Confederate army would never again be a major 
presence in the North, and the Union had complete control of 
the Mississippi River. Despite heavy losses, the Union army, 
now under Grant’s command, moved relentlessly South in 1864. 
Th e shift in strategy to a war of attrition, new military technology, 
and ineff ective medical care all contributed to the horrifi c 
death tolls in 1863 and 1864. Women on both sides played a

This popular picture, drawn by A. H. Ward for Harper’s Weekly in November 1867, illustrated the 
prime meaning of Reconstruction for many African-Americans, whether former slaves or former 
soldiers in the Union army. The end of slavery brought—for the moment—the right to vote. 
Reconstruction 
For those who had been enslaved it was a day of freedom. Th ey celebrated 
as others had done. Houston H. Holloway, a slave sold three 
times before his 20th birthday recalled the day emancipation came 
to Georgia: “I felt like a bird out of a cage.…The week passed off in a 
blaze of glory.” Six weeks later, Holloway and his wife celebrated the birth 
of a new baby and “received my free born son into the world.” For some 
former slaves, nothing mattered more than getting away from their old 
plantations. Th ey moved short distances to be with friends and family or 
great distances to Louisiana, Indian Territory, or the North. For others, 
the news that they could now be wage-earning employees on the same 
plantations where they had previously worked without pay was the best 
option available. Whatever their situation and regardless of their previous 
status, emancipation changed every aspect of life for all people of the 
United States. 
Aft er January 1863, the Emancipation Proclamation made the Union 
Army an army of liberation for slaves during the war itself. Many slaves 
did not wait for the Union army to arrive. When Joseph Davis fl ed the 
plantation that he and his brother Jeff erson Davis owned at Davis Bend

and members of the United States Congress. Th ey passed laws creating a system 
of public education and dreamed of better days ahead. Th e story of the era known 
as Reconstruction, its high hopes and its violent and tragic ending, is the focus of 
this chapter. 
FEDERAL RECONSTRUCTION POLICY 
Explain the political development of federal Reconstruction policy. 
In December 1864, Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts thought Lincoln had 
agreed that former Confederate states must grant all citizens the same right to vote 
as whites (which meant the right of males to vote) to be readmitted to the Union. 
But while Lincoln had come to believe that blacks who fought in the Union army 
had won the right to vote, he also believed that the Constitution gave states the 
right to determine who voted and he did not yet seem ready, as far as anyone knew, 
to interfere. 
When Lincoln died in April 1865, his own party was divided on the question 
of the vote for African-Americans and on how best to handle the readmission of 
the Confederate states within the nation. With the war just ending, the majority 
of Republicans, in and out of Congress, were still moderates. Many had begun the 
Civil War with the intention only to save the Union and had been won over in the 
course of the war to believing that the end of the war had to mean the end of slavery. 
Still, that revised intention was just a single goal; they were not committed to voting 
rights or the award of land for newly freed African-Americans. Other Republicans 
who were coming to be known as Radical Republicans —oft en called simply “the 
radicals”—in Congress were determined that the North’s victory in the Civil War 
meant that the country should give formerly enslaved people not only their freedom 
but also the right to vote and to hold offi ce. In addition, they believed the country 
should provide land to those who had previously worked other people’s land as their 
slaves. In other words, formerly enslaved people should be given all the rights of 
white Americans. 
A similar kind of split existed over the proper ways to readmit states to the 
Union. Lincoln and many other Republicans had argued throughout the war that 
the Southern states had never left the United States; aft er all, preserving the Union 
had been the initial reason that the North went to war in 1861. If the Southern states 
had never left , there was little to do at war’s end but for them to conduct elections 
for local and national offi ce and resume their place in the nation. Others, however, 
especially the Radical Republicans, argued that aft er 4 years of fi ghting against the 
Union, the states of the former Confederacy were eff ectively out of the country and

could be readmitted only aft er some period in which the federal government sought to 
reconstruct state governments to ensure that those who led the rebellion—traitors, as 
the radicals always called them—would not lead the new state governments and that 
the full civil rights of African-Americans would be ensured. Th e diff erence of opinion 
was signifi cant, and compromise was not easy. 
While Lincoln pondered the question of the vote and argued that the debate over 
the term readmission was a distraction from the work at hand, he did take another 
step that would have far-reaching signifi cance in what was to come. Lincoln proposed 
establishing a federal Bureau of Freedmen, Refugees and Abandoned Lands. The 
Freedmen’s Bureau , as it came to be known, would last longer and do more than 
Lincoln ever imagined when he signed the legislation authorizing it in March 1865. 
Lincoln placed great faith in the new government established in Louisiana aft er 
the Union victories there. Th e new legislature pledged loyalty to the Union, created 
a public school system, and aft er it was proposed ratifi ed the Th irteenth Amendment 
abolishing slavery. It had not, however, granted former slaves the right to vote. Lincoln 
pondered the question of whether Louisiana could be brought into proper practical 
relation with the Union sooner by sustaining, or by discarding, her new state government. 
His own answer was clear: he believed that the Louisiana government could 
eventually extend the vote and would provide a model of transition back into the 
Union for other Confederate states. Th e more radical members of Congress did not 
want to give Louisiana full rights as a state until it had guaranteed that blacks would be 
given the right to vote. Th ey blocked counting Louisiana’s electoral votes in the 1864 
election and the seating of the state’s new senators. Th ey would soon do more.

Agency established by Congress in March 
1865 to provide social, educational, and 
economic services as well as advice and 
protection to former slaves. 
A fter Jourdon Anderson and his wife Mandy were freed from slavery 
on a Tennessee plantation belonging to Colonel P. H. Anderson, 
they moved north and settled in Dayton, Ohio. A year later, with the 
war over and the Confederate army disbanded, Colonel Anderson 
wrote to his former slaves asking them to return as employees. Jourdan 
Anderson responded to his former master: 
As to my freedom, which you say I can have, there is nothing 
to be gained on that score, as I got my free-papers in 1864 from 
the Provost-Marshall-General of the Department at Nashville. 
Mandy says she would be afraid to go back without some proof 
that you are sincerely disposed to treat us fairly and justly—and 
we have concluded to test your sincerity by asking you to send 
us our wages for the time we served you. This will make us forget 
and forgive old scores, and rely on your justice and friendship in 
the future. I served you faithfully for thirty-two years and Mandy 
twenty years. At $25 a month for me, and $2 a week for Mandy, 
our earnings would amount to $11,680. Add to this the interest 
for the time our wages has been kept and deduct what you 
paid for our clothing and three doctors visits to me and pulling 
a tooth for Mandy, and the balance will show what we are in justice 
entitled to.…If you fail to pay us for faithful labors in the past 
we can have little faith in your promises in the future. We trust 
the good Maker has opened your eyes to the wrongs which you 
and your fathers have done to me and my fathers, in making us 
toil for generations without recompense. Here I draw my wages 
every Saturday night, but in Tennessee there was never any pay 
day for the negroes any more than for the horses and cows. 
Surely there will be a day of reckoning for those who defraud the 
laborer of his hire.

The post–Civil War era is often described as including three distinct time 
periods. Th e fi rst period is referred to as Presidential Reconstruction in 1865–66, 
when President Johnson sought to return states to their prewar status with only the 
institution of slavery being abolished. Th e next period is known as the more radical 
Congressional Reconstruction (sometimes Radical Reconstruction), which began 
when Congress began to challenge Johnson in 1867 and generally continued through 
the end of Grant’s two terms in 1877. Th e last period, known as “Redemption” (by 
its defenders but not by those who lost rights in the process), began with the election 
of Rutherford B. Hayes in November 1876 and involved the withdrawal of federal 
troops from the South as well as the return of white-only governments. That last 
period culminated in the 1890s with the virtual disenfranchisement of all blacks in 
the South. 
Although this typical chronology is far too simplistic, it does provide an accurate 
framework for the reconstruction process. Th e reality of the process was much more 
complex. Many factions battled from 1865 well into the 1880s and 1890s. Johnson 
was challenged even during his fi rst years in offi ce. Congressional Reconstruction 
had many ups and downs. Grant generally agreed with the Congressional radicals, 
those Congressional leaders and their black and white allies in the South who 
sought to transform the former Confederacy into a racially integrated region with 
equal rights. Nevertheless, in every year between 1867 and 1877, those who sought 
a radical Reconstruction of the South met resistance, oft en very eff ective resistance 
in the South and a growing inclination of Northerners to look the other way as they 
grew tired of the eff ort. Perhaps most important, the end of Reconstruction did not 
come all at once. It was a long process involving defeats and successes throughout 
the country.

The Presidential Reconstruction of Andrew Johnson, 1865–1866 
When Andrew Johnson became president on April 15, 1865, he had served as vice 
president for only 6 weeks. Even so, he came to the presidency with far more 
experience than Lincoln had in 1861. Like Lincoln, Johnson grew up in poverty, but he 
had risen in Tennessee politics from a city alderman to member of the state legislature, 
to Congress, to two terms as governor to the U.S. Senate. When Tennessee seceded 
from the Union in 1861, Johnson—apart from any other Senator from a Confederate 
State—stayed loyal to the Union and stayed in the Senate. He had long seen himself 
as a spokesman for the “honest yeomen” of Tennessee, and he hated what he called 
the state’s “papered, bloated…slaveocracy.” During the Civil War, Johnson served 
with distinction as military governor of Tennessee in those parts of the state where 
the Union army had taken control. When the Republicans met in 1864 to nominate 
Lincoln for a second term, incumbent Vice President Hannibal Hamlin off ered little 
to the ticket; his home state of Maine was sure to go Republican and he had played 
virtually no role in the war. Th e choice of Johnson as Lincoln’s running mate—a border 
state senator and governor—might add essential votes. Although two previous vice 
presidents had succeeded to the presidency, no one expected it to happen again. 
When Johnson became president after Lincoln died, many of those known as 
the Radical Republicans in Congress embraced him. Th ese so-called radicals wanted 
to be sure that the end of the Civil War did not bring merely a return to a version 
of the prewar status quo minus slavery but, instead, wanted the whole South to be 
“reconstructed” to assure economic, educational, and political equality for the former 
slaves. The radicals were often a minority in the Congress and the country, where 
many were willing to accept second-class status for former slaves, but the radicals 
had the clearest agenda for what they wanted to see happen, and every act of postwar 
Southern resistance tended to strengthen their hand. In 1864, Johnson had said, 
“Treason must be made odious, and traitors must be punished and impoverished.” 
And he repeated similar views to members of Congress who met with him right aft er 
Lincoln’s assassination. Ohio Senator Benjamin F. Wade said, “By the Gods, there 
will be no trouble now in running the government.” Another was overheard saying, 
“I believe, that the Almighty continued Mr. Lincoln in offi ce as long as he was useful, 
and then substituted a better man to fi nish the work.” 
When Johnson announced his plans for Reconstruction on May 29, 1865, there 
was widespread disappointment. Johnson supported the Th irteenth Amendment, 
already passed by Congress and ratifi ed by several states, and insisted that support 
for the amendment be a condition for the readmission of any Confederate state to 
the union. But Johnson refused to go beyond that. He made it clear that he had 
little interest in political rights for former slaves. In contrast to his earlier claims, 
Johnson declared a full amnesty and pardon for most of those who had taken part in 
the rebellion as long as they were willing to pledge loyalty to the Union and support 
the end of slavery. Th e amnesty included restoration of all land taken by the Union 
army. Th ere were exceptions to Johnson’s amnesty, however. Major Confederate 
offi cials and individuals who owned more than $20,000 in taxable property had to 
seek individual presidential pardons. 
At first glance, the policy seemed tough on the South or at least on the former 
slaveholders of the South—perhaps tougher than Lincoln would have been—and 
consistent with Johnson’s pledge to keep slaveholders “out in the cold.” But soon, 
many wondered how many individual presidential pardons would be granted as they 
realized that Johnson was granting many more than they had expected. Blacks, though 
now free, seemed destined to be excluded from most of the rights of citizenship in 
the Johnson plan. If former slaveholders were to be given back their land, what land 
would there be for former slaves? Illinois Congressman Elihu B. Washburne said, 
“I have grounds to fear President Johnson may hold almost unconquerable prejudices 
against the African race.”

While the Radical Republicans in Congress were terribly disappointed, many 
Southern whites were delighted at the opportunity to create a “white man’s 
government,” if they accepted the end of slavery. Under Johnson’s plan, former 
Confederate states were readmitted as soon as they ratified the Thirteenth 
Amendment, and the new state governments that were quickly organized in the 
South were recognized by Johnson as the legitimate government of these states. 
(Since most Republicans continued to insist that the rebellious states had never 
left the Union, there was no offi cial way or time for them to be readmitted .) Once 
recognized, these state governments, dominated by many of the same people who 
had been in power before the Civil War, began passing laws strictly limiting black 
rights, most of all, the right to vote. In addition, hunting, fi shing, free grazing of 
livestock, which whites all assumed were their rights and which some slaves had 
enjoyed, were now declared illegal for blacks in a series of what were known as 
Black Codes , passed by states across the South, beginning with Mississippi’s code 
passed in November 1865. One part of the Mississippi code said: 
All freedmen, free negroes and mulattoes in the State, over the age of eighteen, 
found on the second Monday in January, 1866, or thereaft er, with no lawful 
employment or business, or found unlawful assembling themselves together, 
either in the day or nit time, and all white persons assembling with freedmen, 
Free negroes or mulattoes, or unusually associating…on terms of equality… 
shall be deemed vagrants. 
In many states, Black Codes either made it illegal for an African-American to own 
a gun or taxed guns at high rates. In cities, new urban police forces, like the one in 
Mississippi in 1865, were designed to “keep good order and discipline amongst the 
negro population.” Police patrols not only enforced the law but also oft en terrorized 
blacks, especially those who refused to sign long-term labor contracts with former 
slave masters. Any former slave who ran away from a labor contract could be either 
arrested and returned to the plantation holding that contract or sentenced to a chain 
gang to pay off the fi ne for running away. African-Americans in Louisiana noted how 
similar the contracts were to slavery and how similar the new police were to the old 
slave patrols. Th ey also asked “why men who but a few months since were in armed 
rebellion against the government should now have arms put in their hands.” Johnson’s 
amnesty, especially his expectation that these states would reassume all the rights of 
any other state, made these oppressive developments almost inevitable. 
Congressional Radical Reconstruction, 1867–1869 
Th e new Congress that was elected with Lincoln in November 1864 did not assemble 
until December 1865—8 months aft er his death. Th is Congress had an overwhelming 
Republican majority, including many who had become disillusioned with Johnson by 
the time they met, especially as they saw what was happening in the states that had 
so recently been at war with the Union. Th e new president, they thought, was clearly 
siding with the former slaveholders rather than the former slaves. 
Th ose in Congress most unhappy with Johnson, the Radical Republicans, were led 
by Charles Sumner in the Senate and Th addeus Stevens in the House. Stevens told 
the House, “Th e whole fabric of southern society must be changed, and never can it 
be done if this opportunity is lost.” For Stevens, the core values of the Republican 
Party remained, as the party’s campaign slogan said, “free labor” by “free men” who 
earned their livelihoods by the sweat of their own brows. But with Johnson moving 
quickly to recognize the new state governments in the old Confederacy and those 
governments passing rigid Black Codes, the moment seemed to be quickly slipping 
away. Johnson focused on the Constitutional clause giving each state the right to set 
up its own government and arrangements for voting. Stevens and the radicals focused 
on a diff erent part of the Constitution, the clause guaranteeing each state a republican 
form of government.

Most of the Republicans in Congress were not as radical as Stevens or Sumner. In 
1865, a majority probably still had reservations about black voting rights. Even so, nearly 
all were disappointed at Johnson’s easy amnesty of so many former Confederate leaders 
and the way Southern states were coming back into the Union with their old leaders in 
power. Th ey discredited Johnson’s version of Reconstruction because the results resembled 
the antebellum South in far too many ways. In particular, the fact that 58 members 
of the Confederate Congress, six Confederate cabinet offi cers, and the vice president of 
the Confederacy were all elected to Congress in 1865 and 1866 symbolized the failure 
of Johnson’s policy to bring about meaningful change. However, the Constitution also 
gave Congress its own specifi c ways of asserting its authority. 
Soon aft er convening in December 1865, Congress created a Joint Committee on 
Reconstruction. Moderate Senator William Pitt Fessenden of Maine was appointed 
chair, and most of the radicals, including Stevens, were excluded. Nevertheless, 
Congress undermined presidential Reconstruction by refusing to seat the 
Congressional delegates from the former Confederate states, even though Johnson 
considered those states to be fully restored to the Union. (Johnson’s use of “restoration” 
rather than “reconstruction” irked many in Congress who wanted to see at least 
some change rather than restoring states to the place they had held in 1860.) Despite 
Johnson’s insistence that the states had a right to be represented in Congress, the reality 
was that the Constitution made each house of Congress sole judge of the qualifi cations 
of its members, and neither house was ready to seat former Confederate leaders. 
Senator Ben Wade demanded that no Southern state be given a vote in Congress until 
African-Americans had the right to vote in that state. Others called for the creation 
of territorial governments in the former Confederate states, which would be under 
the control of Congress so that both voting rights and land redistribution could be 
assured. But Congress itself was divided, and action beyond rejecting the delegates 
from the South was hard to come by. Even legislation to give blacks in the District of 
Columbia the right to vote—something Congress clearly had authority to do—could 
not make it through both houses, especially aft er a December 1865 referendum of 
white voters in the District rejected black voting rights 6,951 to 35. 
Early in 1866, Illinois Senator Lyman Trumbull proposed two new pieces of 
legislation. Unlike the more radical Republicans, Trumbull still maintained a good 
working relationship with Johnson and worried about the federal government exceeding 
its authority. But given developments in the South, Trumbull felt Congress had 
the authority—even the duty—to protect the rights of newly freed African-Americans 
under the Thirteenth Amendment, which included language giving Congress the 
power to pass laws to enforce the amendment. 
First, Trumbull proposed extending the life of the Freedmen’s Bureau. When 
Lincoln signed the legislation creating the Bureau, it was envisioned as a 1-year 
transitional body. However, through late 1865 and early 1866, the Freedmen’s 
Bureau was the key federal agency distributing food to former slaves, supporting the 
establishment of schools, and in some cases, even helping former slaves gain their own 
land. Aft er consulting with the head of the bureau, General O. O. Howard, Trumbull 
became convinced that its work would take many years and proposed extending it 
to 1870. He also proposed giving it new authority to ensure that blacks had all “civil 
rights belonging to white persons” and giving bureau agents the authority to press 
charges against state offi cials who denied those rights. 
Trumbull then proposed the far-reaching Civil Rights Bill of 1866 that defi ned 
all persons born in the United States (except Indians) as citizens, permanently 
ending the Dred Scott distinctions between whites and blacks. Although the bill was 
silent on the issue of voting, given that many of the citizens it referred to—women 
and children, for example—could not vote, it explicitly guaranteed rights to make 
contracts, bring lawsuits, and have the equal benefi t of the laws without regard to race. 
Th e law declared that such provisions were “fundamental rights belonging to every 
man as a free man.” It also authorized federal authorities to prosecute violations in

federal courts, a signifi cant provision since Southern state courts were quickly reverting 
to their white-dominated ways. 
Both of Trumbull’s bills would have appeared radical a year or two earlier, but in 1866, 
they were seen as moderate proposals from a moderate Senator, and everyone expected 
smooth sailing for them. Then, after they passed Congress easily, President Johnson 
vetoed both bills. He called the Freedmen’s Bureau an “immense patronage” system that 
exceeded the constitutional authority of the federal government, and he characterized the 
civil rights bill an as unwarranted “concentration of all legislative powers in the national 
Government.” In his veto of the Civil Rights bill, Johnson also went out of his way to say 
that giving blacks citizenship rights was wrong and that “the distinction of race and color 
is by the bill made to operate in favor of the colored and against the white race.” 
The vetoes ended congressional efforts to work with the president on 
Reconstruction. Trumbull attacked the president. Senator William Pitt Fessenden, up 
to then considered a moderate, predicted that Johnson would “veto every other bill we 
pass.” Johnson was prepared to do just that. He wanted to court Northern Democrats 
and Southern whites in his bid for a second term. Congress passed both pieces of 
legislation over Johnson’s vetoes and began to use a veto-proof two-thirds majority to 
pass similar legislation in spite of presidential opposition. Th e era of presidential-led 
Reconstruction was fast coming to an end. 
Aft er passing Trumbull’s two major bills over the president’s veto in the spring of 
1866, Congress proposed another amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Amendments 
to the Constitution proposed in Congress are not subject to a presidential veto, although 
three-fourths of the state legislatures need to agree to them. So in 1866, Congress set out 
to put the Civil Rights law into the Constitution itself. Agreement to do so came quickly; 
however, agreement on the other provisions of the amendment came much more slowly. 
Congress was not yet ready to give all black males the same voting rights that all white 
males had, but Sumner and some other radicals would never support an amendment 
that did not guarantee such rights. When their opposition was combined with the 
Democratic minority who did not want any new rights inscribed in the Constitution, 
craft ing the amendment became a major hurdle. Many members of Congress wanted 
to punish any state that withheld the vote from black males, but they did not want to 
punish those states—currently all of them—that withheld the vote from women or those 
states—including several in the North—that made it hard for recent immigrants to vote. 
All of these issues led to months of wrangling, but the compromise that emerged as the 
Fourteenth Amendment guaranteeing rights of citizenship to former slaves and others 
born or naturalized in the United States was nevertheless signifi cant. 
Th e key provision of the Fourteenth Amendment said: 
All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the 
jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein 
they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the 
privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State 
deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor 
deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. 
Other clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment stated changes drastically different 
from the Th ree-Fift h’s clause and other previously accepted parts of the Constitution. 
Th ey included language saying that any state that limited the voting rights of male 
inhabitants of a state would have its representation in Congress reduced, that any 
person who had held federal office and then participated in rebellion against the 
government could not again hold offi ce, and that Confederate debts were null and 
void as far as the federal government was concerned. 
Both houses of Congress fi nally passed the amendment in June 1866 and sent it 
to the states for ratifi cation. Just as Johnson had refused to recognize a state as having 
returned to the Union until it ratified the Thirteenth Amendment, Congress now 
refused to seat the members of the House or Senate elected by a state until the state had

ratifi ed the Fourteenth Amendment. Th e amendment was popular in the North and 
many in the South were anxious to return to Congress, so approval from the required 
three-quarters of the states came quickly and the amendment was ratifi ed in July 1868. 
When Congress reconvened in December 1866, the majority of Republicans 
had no interest in working with Johnson. While the president called for immediate 
restoration of the “now unrepresented States” to Congress, Congress decided that, 
in fact, the states of the former Confederacy needed to be governed directly from 
Washington until “some indefi nite future time.” Some said that Congress was raising 
the bar after earlier requiring only assent to the Fourteenth Amendment, but the 
majority in Congress were no longer in any mood to compromise. 
In January 1867, Congress quickly passed a law—over presidential veto— giving 
black males in the District of Columbia the right to vote. Since the district was 
directly controlled by Congress, they could pass such a law even though the Fift eenth 
Amendment, giving all black males the same voting rights as white males, was not yet 
contemplated. Congressional leaders then turned to more far-reaching legislation. Th ey 
passed the Reconstruction Act of 1867, which declared all Southern state governments— 
already recognized by Johnson—to be inoperative and divided the former Confederate 
states into fi ve military districts, ordering the military to oversee the writing of new 
constitutions that would guarantee universal male suff rage (see Map 15-1 ). Only aft er 
these new constitutions were in place, and after a state had ratified the Fourteenth 
Amendment, would Congress admit its representatives to Congress. 
Th e president protested that the Reconstruction Act was, “the death-knell of civil 
liberty.” African-Americans in the South, however, embraced the opportunity to 
participate in the political process. In addition to registering to vote and participating 
in constitution writing, blacks struck for higher pay in Charleston, Savannah, Mobile, 
Richmond, and New Orleans. Blacks in Richmond demanded integrated horse-drawn 
streetcars. Across the South, they created Union Leagues that became a base for political 
action and mutual support. Th e leagues off ered opportunities to gain experience 
in the political process or, as one former slave said, “We just went there, and we talked 
a little, made speeches on one question and another.” Former slaves became political 
leaders. By 1867, James H. Jones, the former “body servant” to Jeff erson Davis, was a 
featured speaker at Republican meetings across the South. 
The Final Break—Johnson’s Impeachment 
By 1867, President Johnson had become virtually irrelevant to federal Reconstruction 
policy. Congress passed laws, the president vetoed them, and Congress passed them 
over the president’s veto. But the Freedman’s Bureau was under the control of the 
president even if he vetoed the bill that kept it going. Th e creation of military districts 
in the South also gave the president signifi cant powers as commander-in-chief, even 
though he had opposed creating them. 
Some in Congress began to consider removing Johnson in early 1867, but they 
were in a minority. Instead, Congress passed a number of laws that most hoped would 
keep Reconstruction moving in spite of the president. One law required all presidential 
orders to the military to pass through the army chief, General Grant, before going 
to commanders in the fi eld. Grant was known to side with Congress, and this strategy 
seemed like an important safeguard and a signifi cant limitation of Johnson’s power. 
Congress also passed the Tenure of Office Act, which said that any person whose 
appointment required the Senate’s consent, namely, members of the cabinet and 
ambassadors, could be replaced only when the Senate approved a successor. Th e goal 
of the act was to ensure that Secretary of War Stanton, who had been appointed by 
Lincoln and who took a tough stance on Reconstruction, stayed in offi ce. 
Th ese Congressional actions might have worked had Johnson been willing to play a 
passive role, but Johnson could be stubborn, proud, and self-focused. His loyal Secretary 
of the Navy Gideon Welles said, “He has no confi dantes and seeks none.” As a result,

unlike Lincoln, Johnson was oft en out of touch with congressional thinking. Th ese traits 
set the stage for an even more serious collision between the president and the Congress. 
While Congress took charge of Reconstruction, Johnson became convinced that he 
had public opinion on his side and began to encourage opponents of Reconstruction, 
in the North and South. He also removed several of the tougher military commanders 
in the South and replaced them with offi cers who were willing to let events take their 
own course, which meant letting former Confederates take control of local governments 
and use their power to undermine black rights. Th en in February 1868, aft er 
the Senate refused Johnson’s request to remove Stanton, the president, in violation of 
the Tenure of Offi ce act, fi red him. It was a clear challenge to congressional authority. 
Under the U.S. Constitution, a president can be removed only for “high crimes 
and misdemeanors,” terms the Constitution does not defi ne. But the procedure for 
impeachment is clear. The House of Representatives is required to act as a sort of 
Grand Jury, deciding whether or not to bring charges, called impeachment, against 
the president. Th en the Senate, with the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court presiding, 
acts as a jury to hear and vote on the charges. Only with a Senate vote to convict can a 
president be removed from offi ce. 
Led by Thaddeus Stevens, the House, with every Republican voting positively, 
agreed on a long list of charges, most having to do with Johnson’s violation of the 
Tenure of Offi ce Act but also a charge saying that the president had tried to bring 
Congress “into disgrace.” However, the trial in the Senate did not go as well for the 
radicals. Removing a president was very serious business, and it was unclear that

Johnson’s obstructionism met the level of a “high crime.” It was also not clear that the 
Tenure of Offi ce Act was constitutional. Johnson claimed that he meant the fi ring of 
Stanton to be tested in the Supreme Court. If Johnson were removed, then Senator Ben 
Wade, president pro tem of the Senate, would become president since there was no 
vice president, and many who disliked Johnson also disliked Wade. When the Senate 
fi nally voted in mid-May of 1868, Johnson survived by one vote. Johnson could serve 
out his term in relative peace, although his chances for the Democratic nomination 
and reelection were slim. 
The Right to Vote—Grant’s Election and the Fifteenth Amendment 
Aft er Johnson’s impeachment was resolved, both parties turned to selecting nominees 
for the presidential election in the fall of 1868. For the Republicans, the choice was 
easy. Ulysses S. Grant as commander of the army had supported the Republicans 
in Congress on the issues of Reconstruction; his own attitudes on race had been 
signifi cantly reshaped by the courage shown by black troops during the Civil War, and 
he was the nation’s war hero. Th e Republicans easily nominated him along with the 
Speaker of the House Schuyler Colfax of Indiana as his running mate. Grant ran on a 
cautious platform that nevertheless embraced extending voting rights to former slaves. 
His slogan was, “Let Us Have Peace.” 
Democrats were divided on issues of personality, on their opposition to 
Congressional Reconstruction, and on fiscal policies—whether to continue to 
authorize the printing of money, or “greenbacks,” based on the federal promise to pay. 
Aft er 21 ballots in which a number of candidates, including Andrew Johnson, failed 
to win the nomination, they chose former New York Governor Horatio Seymour, 
who had flirted with supporting the Confederacy during the war and who had 
called protesters in the New York Draft Riot “my friends.” For vice president, they 
nominated a former Union general from Missouri, Francis Blair, who called for an 
end to Reconstruction, which he called the rule of “a semi- barbarous race of blacks.” 
While neither party articulated a fully developed economic policy, the lines between 
the parties were drawn on the issues of race. August Belmont, one of the nation’s leading 
bankers, said that, in the 1868 election, fi nancial matters paled in comparison with 
black voting rights. In November, Grant carried most of the North and the parts of 
the South under federal control, including North and South Carolina and Alabama. 
Seymour’s home state of New York, along with New Jersey, Georgia, and Louisiana 
favored Seymour. Th e state governments in Florida, Mississippi, and Texas had not yet 
been recognized, and those states did not vote. Grant won 53 percent of the popular vote 
but an overwhelming 73 percent of the electoral vote for an easy victory. 
With Grant about to become president, Republicans in Congress moved quickly 
on the issue of voting rights. In February 1869, Congress passed the Fifteenth 
Amendment, which stated: 
Th e right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged 
by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous 
condition of servitude. 
In a little less than a year, by February 1870, the required three-fourths of the states 
ratifi ed the amendment and the right of former slaves, and other citizens, including 
the children of Chinese immigrants—who were citizens but had also been denied the 
right to vote—had been inscribed in the Constitution. 
As powerful as the language of the Fift eenth Amendment is, it lacked some wording 
that many had wanted to include. The radicals had wanted the amendment to 
state that neither the right to vote nor the right to hold offi ce could be abridged. But 
others feared that several Northern states, including California with its large Chinese 
population, might reject the amendment if the right of nonwhite people to hold offi ce 
were included. Many also had wanted wording to prohibit the many tricks that some 

Chapter 15 Reconstruction 457 
15.1 
15.2 
15.3 
Southern governments were already using to limit the black vote, including literacy 
tests that could be manipulated to exclude whoever the test giver wanted excluded, 
or tests related to property or education. Supporters of the amendment, however, 
worried that they would lose too much Northern support if they included such 
clauses. Massachusetts and Connecticut used literacy tests to limit voting by foreignborn 
citizens, while Pennsylvania and Rhode Island had property or tax qualifi cations 
for voting, and no one wanted to risk losing the support of those states. As a result, 
important safeguards were not included. 
Many women, especially the most prominent leaders of the women’s rights 
movement, were deeply disappointed and angered by the Fifteenth Amendment. 
Women like Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Sojourner Truth had 
labored long and hard in support of abolition and the Union cause, and now they 
saw women’s right to vote ignored. Frederick Douglass was an advocate of women’s 
rights in addition to African-American rights, but in 1869, he precipitated a long 
and painful, though temporary, break with Anthony and Stanton over the Fift eenth 
Amendment. Douglass argued for one step at a time, guaranteeing black men the 
same rights as white men, and then guaranteeing women of all races the right to vote. 
Douglass said, “I hold that women, as well as men, have the right to vote, and my heart 
and my voice go with the movement to extend suff rage to women.” Th ese were not 
just words. In the decade before and aft er battles around the Fift eenth Amendment, 
Douglass actively campaigned for women’s right to vote. But between 1865 and 1870, 
Douglass was willing to compromise to achieve his immediate goal. 
Th e compromise that Douglass proposed brought a sharp rebuke from the former 
slave and abolitionist Sojourner Truth. In 1867, at the height of the debate, Truth gave 
her own passionate response to Douglass. She said that she, too, had been born a slave 
and rejoiced that “Th ey have got their liberty—so much good luck to have slavery 
Harper’s Weekly carried many illustrations of the changes happening in the South to Northern audiences. 
This issue of July 1868 showed the enthusiasm with which African-Americans, many of whom had been 
slaves only a few years before, were taking to electoral politics.

partly destroyed; not entirely. I want it root and branch destroyed.” For Truth, root 
and branch meant the vote for all. Partial justice would not do, “and if colored men get 
their rights, and not colored women theirs, you see the colored men will be masters 
over the women, and it will be just as bad as it was before.” 
In spite of compromises and disappointments, many hailed the Fifteenth 
Amendment as completing the work of abolition. As late as 1868, free blacks could 
vote in only eight Northern states. In 1870, by law, black men could vote everywhere 
in the United States. William Lloyd Garrison celebrated “this wonderful, quite sudden 
transformation…from the auction-block to the ballot-box.” While there was already 
clear evidence of the many steps—by law and by violence—that would be taken to 
deny most blacks the right to vote for most of the next century, in 1870, there was also 
grounds for very real optimism. 
15.1 
Quick Review Compare Presidential Reconstruction and Congressional Reconstruction. 
What are the most signifi cant differences between the two plans? Given these 
differences, was the tension between them inevitable? 
THE IMPACT OF RECONSTRUCTION 
Explain the impact of Reconstruction on African-American life in the South. 
In the early years of Reconstruction, many of the South’s former leaders returned to power. 
Only one Southern offi cial was tried for treason and executed—Henry Wirz, commander 
of the infamous Andersonville prison where so many Union soldiers died. Jeff erson Davis 
was imprisoned for 2 years but then was freed and retired to write his memoirs. Many 
other Confederate leaders quickly declared their loyalty to the Union aft er the war’s end, 
received a pardon from Johnson, and resumed leadership in their states. Within a year of 
announcing his plan to exclude the wealthy and the political leaders of the Confederacy 
from the original amnesty conditions, Johnson had granted 7,000 individual pardons. Th e 
prewar status quo seemed to be returning in the Southern states. Th en Congress took over 
Reconstruction, and everything changed. In state legislatures, local sheriff ’s offi ces, and 
school boards, former slaves, Northern abolitionists, and Southern Unionists took power 
under the banner of the Republican Party or local Union Leagues. A radical remaking of 
the South began in the late 1860s and continued into the 1870s. 
Voting in the South 
In January 1870, the Mississippi state legislature elected Hiram R. Revels to the 
United States Senate. Revels was the fi rst African-American ever elected to the Senate. 
The legislature that elected Revels included 40 blacks and 100 whites—hardly a 
black-dominated body. He was elected, ironically, to fi ll Jeff erson Davis’s former seat, 
left vacant since Davis departed in 1861. 
Revels was born free in Fayetteville, North Carolina, in 1827. Like many of the 
African-American political leaders during Reconstruction, he was a minister in the 
African Methodist Episcopal Church, serving as a pastor in Baltimore, Maryland, 
when the Civil War began. Revels organized two all-black regiments and served as 
their chaplain. At the war’s end, Revels went with his unit to Vicksburg, Mississippi, 
and then moved to Natchez. He was not initially a candidate for the Senate, but his 
lack of ambition for the post made him a perfect compromise candidate. 
Senator Garrett Davis of Kentucky challenged the right of an African-American 
to be seated in the Senate. But Revels’s key defender, James Nye of Nevada, told his 
colleagues, “In 1861 from this hall departed two senators who were representing here 
the state of Mississippi; one of them who went defi antly was Jeff erson Davis.” For Nye, 
and eventually for a majority in the Senate, nothing was a more fi tting symbol of the

15.1 

Chapter 15 Reconstruction 459 
outcome of the Civil War than the seating of an African-American in the place of 
the former president of the Confederacy. 
Mississippi later sent Blanche K. Bruce to the Senate in 1874. Bruce was born 
a slave, but he attended Oberlin College and established himself as a planter in 
Mississippi in 1868. Unlike Revels, he worked his way up the political ladder, serving 
as the sergeant-at-arms of the Mississippi state senate, assessor and sheriff of Bolivar 
County, and a member of the Board of Levee Commissioners of the Mississippi River. 
Navigation on the Mississippi was a major concern of his during his U.S. Senate 
tenure, as was opposition to Chinese exclusion. Bruce was the last African-American 
to serve in the Senate until Edward Brooke was elected from Massachusetts in 1966. 
More African-Americans were elected to the House. Twenty-two blacks served 
in Congress during Reconstruction, including 13 who had been born slaves. Between 
1871 and 1873, South Carolina had three African-Americans in the House—Joseph 
H. Rainey, Robert B. Elliott, and Robert G. DeLarge. In the same sessions, Benjamin 
S. Turner represented Alabama; Josiah T. Walls, Florida; and Joseph Long, Georgia. 
Rainey served three terms in the House during which time he played an important 
role in arguing for the fi rst major federal aid to education bill that was considered, 
although defeated, in Congress. 
Reconstruction state governments, with black and white leadership, expanded the 
right to vote, abolishing restrictions that had existed for black and poor white voters. 
In addition, newly formulated state constitutions created public school systems and 
internal improvements designed to bring the South into the modern world. It was a 
heady time, yet not an easy one. 
Schools for Freedom 
Northern whites who came to the South with the Union army were amazed by 
the thirst for literacy demonstrated by former slaves. A member of an education 
society in North Carolina said, “he thought a school-house would be the fi rst proof 
of their independence .” Booker T. Washington, a well-known African-American

educator remembered the immediate aft ermath of emancipation: “Few people who 
were not right in the midst of the scenes can form any exact idea of the intense desire 
which the people of my race showed for education. It was a whole race trying to go 
to school.” 
Realizing that blacks saw the schoolhouse as “proof of their independence” 
surprised white observers. It did not surprise former slaves who had grown up 
in a world where literacy, for them, was a crime. As a slave child of seven or eight, 
Frederick Douglass had been taught the alphabet by a white woman, but the lessons 
did not last long. He remembered: 
Mr. Auld found out what was going on, and at once forbade Mrs. Auld to 
instruct me further, telling her, among other things, that it was unlawful, as well 
as unsafe, to teach a slave to read.…It would forever unfi t him to be a slave.” 
Nothing appealed more to young Douglass than being made unfit for slavery. 
Douglass found secret ways to continue his studies, and by the time he made his 
escape to Massachusetts, Douglass had the literacy skills that would make him one 
of the great orators and writers of his day. Slave masters and slave-state legislatures 
who made it illegal to teach a slave to read or write, unwittingly also made literacy a 
powerful symbol of freedom. 
While the majority of teachers who went South to teach were white women, an 
African-American, Charlotte Forten, began teaching in Port Royal, South Carolina, 
where she said, “Th e children are well-behaved and eager to learn. It will be a happiness 
to teach here.” By 1870, several thousand teachers—whites and blacks, Northern 
J ohn Roy Lynch was born a slave and elected as a Republican to 
the Mississippi legislature in 1869. In this essay, he described what 
Reconstruction meant to those who, like him, were trying to create a 
new political system, indeed a new culture, in the states that had been 
part of the Confederacy only a few years before. 
The new administration had an important and difficult task 
before it. A state government had to be organized from top to 
bottom. A new judiciary had to be inaugurated, consisting of 
three justices of the state supreme court, fifteen judges of the 
circuit court, and twenty chancery court judges, all of whom had 
to be appointed by the governor, by and with the advice and 
consent of the [state] senate. In addition to this, a new public 
school system had to be organized and established. There was 
not a public school building anywhere in the state except in a 
few of the larger towns, and they, with possibly a few exceptions, 
were greatly in need of repair. To erect the necessary schoolhouses 
and to reconstruct and repair those already in existence 
so as to afford educational facilities for both races was by no 
means an easy task. It necessitated a very large outlay of cash in 
the beginning which resulted in a material increase in the rate 
of taxation for the time being, but the constitution called for the 
establishment of the system and, of course, the work had to be 
done. It was not only done, but it was done creditably and as 
economically as circumstances and conditions at that time made 
possible. That system, though slightly changed, still stands as a 
creditable monument to the work of the first Republican state 
administration that was organized in the state of Mississippi 
under the Reconstruction Acts of the Congress. 
It was also necessary to reorganize, reconstruct, and in many 
instances, rebuild some of the penal, charitable, and other public 
institutions of the state. A new code of laws also had to be adopted 
to take the place of the old one, and thus wipe out the black 
laws that had been passed by what was known as the Johnson 
legislature. Also it was necessary to change the statutes of the state 
to harmonize with the new order of things. This was no easy task, 
especially in view of the fact that a heavy increase in the rate of taxation 
was thus made necessary.

immigrants, and veterans of the Confederate army—were teaching in schools for 
former slaves. Although a majority stayed for only a year or two, some found their life’s 
work in these schools. 
Many newly free African-Americans welcomed Northern white teachers for the 
long term, but they also wanted teachers from their own communities. Th e Freedmen’s 
Bureau and Northern missionary groups helped in founding black colleges in the 
South, including Atlanta, Fisk, Hampton, and Tugaloo, which were specifically 
designed to train black teachers, oft en in a short course that lasted 1 or 2 years. Th e 
results of the new eff orts at teacher preparation were impressive, and as early as 1869, 
the bureau reported that of the 3,000 teachers for the freedmen, the majority were now 
African-American. 
Th e Reconstruction Act of 1867 also fostered the growth of Southern schooling. 
Th e 1867 act required states of the former Confederacy to call state conventions to 
rewrite their state constitutions, and the new constitutions were expected to include 
support for public education. Later, even as state aft er state returned to white rule, 
the public school system remained. In Black Reconstruction in America , W.E.B. Du 
Bois, a renowned African-American activist, wrote, “Public education for all at public 
expense was, in the South, a Negro idea.” 
The Reality of Sharecropping 
For many newly freed slaves, another issue was as important as the vote or education— 
land. In Virginia, a freedman told a Union army offi cer that, if the army had a right 
to take away the master’s slaves, then they “had the right to take master’s land too.” 
In Alabama, a state convention delegate insisted, “the property which they hold 
was nearly all earned by the sweat of our brows.” Th ose closest to the land, who had 
worked it for no pay, valued land and the promise of land ownership. Land provided 
independent economic opportunity on which freedom rested. 
When Sherman’s army arrived in Savannah, Georgia, in December 1864, the army 
of 60,000 troops was accompanied by some 20,000 former slaves. Sherman met with 
local blacks in Savannah. Garrison Frazier, a leader of that group, made it clear what 
they wanted: freedom and land, which meant “placing us where we could reap the fruit

of our own labor.” Four days later, Sherman’s Special Field Order No. 15 provided for 
40-acre parcels of land for black families, which was to be taken from the plantations of 
owners in active rebellion on the Sea Islands and coastal areas in Georgia and, later, in 
South Carolina (once his army got there). Sherman also off ered army mules that were no 
longer needed. Th us, 40 acres and a mule became the symbol of freedom to many, and 
by June 1865, 40,000 newly freed people were settled on “Sherman land” in the former 
Confederacy. Sherman’s order did not make it clear whether the land grant was temporary 
or permanent, but the link of freedom and land was permanent in the minds of many. 
President Johnson wasted no time ending the redistribution of land after 
taking offi ce. He ordered an end to the “40 acres and a mule” policy. As head of the 
Freedman’s Bureau, General O. O. Howard had expanded Sherman’s original South 
Carolina plan, instructing his agents to “set aside” 40-acre tracts for individual 
freedmen. Blacks across the South quickly began farming their own plots. Johnson 
overrode Howard’s order, issued pardons to former plantation owners, and ordered 
Howard to restore the land to them, which meant taking it away from those who were 
currently using it. Once land had been returned to its former owners, there was very 
little chance that former slaves would regain their parcels. 
In October 1865, General Howard made a painful journey to Edisto Island in 
South Carolina to announce the president’s order. A committee of freedmen draft ed 
their response: 
General, we want Homesteads…if the government having concluded to 
befriend its late enemies and to neglect to observe the principles of common 
faith between its self and us its allies in the war you said was over, now takes 
away from them all right to the soil they stand upon save such as they can get 
by again working for your late and their all time enemies.…You will see this is 
not the condition of really freemen. 
Redistribution of land, it seemed, was not going to be part of Reconstruction. 
John W. Alvord was an unusually perceptive observer who 
was in charge of setting up schools for the Freedmen’s 
Bureau. In his first report to the bureau in Washington, DC, in 
1866, Alvord noted, somewhat to his surprise, that there were 
often black-initiated schools already in operation when he 
arrived to open schools. Thus, he wrote in his first report: 
Throughout the entire South an effort is being made by the 
colored people to educate themselves.…In the absence of 
other teaching they are determined to be self-taught; and 
everywhere some elementary text-book, or the fragment of 
one, may be seen in the hands of negroes.…Native schools… 
are making their appearance through the interior of the 
entire country. 
A more detailed reading of the report makes it clear that 
Alvord was surprised first by the commitment of the 
newly freed people to education, second by their sense of 
initiative in launching their own schools even before any 
federal or missionary teachers arrived, and third by the sense 
of self-respect and self-determination that those running the 
schools were maintaining.

Chapter 15 Reconstruction 463 
In a few places, however, former slaves were able to purchase or win government 
land. Having spent their lives in unpaid labor, few slaves had any resources to 
buy land, even when it was being sold very cheaply in the aft ermath of the war. In 
South Carolina, which had an exceptionally strong Reconstruction government, the 
legislature established a state land commission that provided grants of land to some 
14,000 black families—perhaps one-seventh of the state’s black population—in various 
parts of the state. Th ey also created the town of Promised Land, which continues as a 
black-led community to the present. 
Th e primary economic opportunity open to slaves was to return to the plantations 
where they had worked in the past, but do so as paid employees. Neither former 
slaves nor former slave owners found the prospect encouraging. One Georgia planter 
complained that, “Once we had reliable labor controlled at will. Now…it is both 
uncertain and unreliable.” When railroads or new enterprises off ered jobs, blacks left 
the plantations to take other work. 
During the Johnson-dominated Reconstruction, Southern landowners not only 
reclaimed their lands but also ensured the passage of vagrancy laws made it a crime 
to be without a job, which meant former slaves had to take whatever was off ered 
or be jailed. Some landowners agreed to hire only their own former slaves, making 
it extremely diffi cult for newly free people to bargain for wages or move to better 
opportunities. 
Many in Washington were pleased to see blacks become wage earners, paid for 
raising the cotton, sugar, rice, and tobacco they had previously raised without pay as 
slaves. But former slaves did not like working for wages, especially the low wages that 
were off ered for work in the same places where they had once labored as slaves. Wageearning 
blacks resented their status as what some called “wage slaves.” Th ey wanted land 
of their own, and if they could not get land—and in most parts of the South they could 
not—they wanted a share in the profi ts of their work.

Edisto Island, off the coast of South Carolina, was one of the fi rst places where the government provided land 
and mules—and mule carts. Former slaves quickly used the opportunity to become independent farmers. 

464 Part V Expansion, Separation, and a New Union, 1844–1877 
Given the dissatisfaction that both white landowners and black workers felt, a 
new economic arrangement was born: sharecropping . Sharecropping meant just what 
the name implied. Instead of working for wages, former slaves worked as independent 
entrepreneurs who were guaranteed a share of the crop in return for their labor. At 
the same time, landowners, who provided the land, the seeds, and the loans to get 
through the year, also received a share of the crop. 
As this agricultural economy developed aft er the Civil War, the owner of a large 
tract of land (almost always a former plantation owner who had the land returned 
by the Johnson administration) agreed to provide crude housing, a short-term loan 
for living expenses (known as the “furnish” and usually provided at the beginning of 
the growing season in March), seed, fertilizer, tools, and the right to grow cotton on a 
specifi ed piece of land 15 to 40 acres in area. Landless tenants (almost always former 
slaves) agreed to work the land, plant, weed or “chop” the cotton through the growing 
season, and bring in a crop. Landowner and sharecropper would then split the profi ts 
aft er the harvest. 
Once the harvest was done, just before Christmas at “the settle,” the landowner 
would provide the sharecropper with a statement of accounts showing the value of 
the cotton harvest, the cost of the “furnish,” and any other loans or purchases at the 
commissary on the plantation (usually the only place the sharecropper could buy 
goods and oft en a place where prices were very high), and the diff erence or profi t due 
to the sharecropper. Everyone knew that many planters cheated their oft en illiterate 
tenants. Asking for a detailed accounting meant risking one’s home and perhaps one’s 
life. Few took the risk, though many sharecroppers were privately furious when the 
end-of-year payments were fi nally made and, somehow, the results for those who had 
worked all year were so modest. 
Sharecropping began on the sugar plantations of Louisiana and quickly spread to 
the rest of the agricultural South. With sharecropping, black workers had a signifi - 
cant new incentive to work since they retained a portion of the profi ts they created. 
Women and children, who had resisted work in the fi eld for wages, now returned to 
the fi elds as families sought to make a living. 
At first, landowners were far from enthusiastic about sharecropping. While it 
meant that they no longer needed to supervise employees, they did not like the sense of 
independence that sharecropping brought to former slaves. Th ey also disliked the shift 
from having farm work done by gangs of laborers, as had been the case in slavery and 
wage-earning times, to having the work 
done by family units on smaller plots. 
One South Carolina planter complained 
about the black-led Union Leagues that 
fostered sharecropping saying, “Their 
leaders counsel them not to work for 
wages at all, but to insist upon setting 
up for themselves.” Nevertheless, by the 
early 1870s, sharecropping had become 
the primary means of agricultural 
organization in much of the South, 
especially the region’s great cottongrowing 
heartland (see Map 15-2 ). 
Before long, plantation owners found 
ways to manipulate it for their own 
ends. Owners developed a credit system 
whereby a plantation-store sold everything 
from food to clothing on credit to 
the sharecroppers to be repaid when the 
crop was harvested. Many plantation

owners made as much money with their stores as with their crops. With crops mortgaged 
before they were even planted, workers fell further and further into debt to the 
landowners. If sharecropping initially gave black families freedom that work for wages 
did not, it also tied them to the land in poverty for generations.

TERROR, APATHY, AND THE CREATION OF THE SEGREGATED SOUTH 
Analyze the reasons Reconstruction ended and the impact of Redemption. 
During the first decade after the Civil War, Americans witnessed extraordinary 
changes. Slavery ended, and the Constitution was amended to give former slaves citizenship 
rights and the same right to vote as whites. Black males voted, held offi ce, 
and served on juries, and black men, women, and children rode on integrated transit 
and attended school. Some even managed to own their own land. However, few of the 
advances of the fi rst decade of Reconstruction lasted.

Th e rise and decline of black rights was an uneven process. Blacks were organizing 
and gaining new rights while the Civil War was still being fought. Many whites resisted 
black political and economic progress throughout Congressional Reconstruction. 
Although the withdrawal of federal troops in 1877 greatly hastened the process of undoing 
the gains of Reconstruction, what some white Southerners called “Redemption,” 
that, too, was uneven. In some areas, white-only government had been reestablished well 
before 1877, while in other areas, blacks maintained political rights well into the 1880s 
and 1890s. Nevertheless, eventually, the high hopes of Reconstruction ended everywhere. 
Opposition to Black Rights and the Roots of “Redemption” 
Opponents of black rights were never completely excluded from power during 
Reconstruction. In September 1868, the white majority in the Georgia legislature 
voted to expel all 27 African-American representatives. Henry McNeal Turner, one of 
the 27, responded: “You may expel us, gentlemen, by your votes today; but while you 
do it, remember that there is a just God in Heaven.” Two years later, in response to 
actions like the expulsion of the black legislators, President Grant reinstated military 
rule in Georgia. Black legislators returned to their seats along with white allies and 
opponents, and a majority in the legislature ratifi ed the Fift eenth Amendment. 
With Grant in the White House and Republican leaders in Congress who were 
willing to use federal troops if necessary to support the rights of former slaves and 
their allies, the Republican Party in the South was the party of black rights and 
racial equality. Blacks, oft en organized in Union Leagues, were at the heart of the 
party, but there were also large numbers of white Republicans in the South, including 
both Southern born and immigrants from the North. Southern whites who 
supported Republican and multiracial eff orts were called scalawags , and they were 
a diverse lot. Some had opposed secession from 1861. Others, like Confederate 
General James Longstreet or army veteran Albert R. Parsons, embraced the 
Republican Party only aft er the war. Some, like Parsons, strongly supported equal 
rights for blacks. For others, support for black rights was secondary, but they saw 
the party as a place of personal opportunity. 
Northern whites who came South were called carpetbaggers because, Southerners 
said, they could carry everything they owned in a single suitcase covered with carpet-like 
material. Resentful, Southerners claimed that carpetbaggers had come South to get rich. 
Carpetbaggers were on the whole younger and less prosperous than the scalawags. Some 
carpetbaggers were no doubt opportunists, coming to make their fortune, while others 
were abolitionists, coming South to implement policies they had long advocated. Many 
were veterans of the Union army, and some like Governor Adelbert Ames, the Republican 
Governor of Mississippi, had fi rst been ordered South by the army and had stayed on. 
In the 1860s and 1870s, there were virtually no black Democrats in the South. Th e 
post–Civil War Democratic Party was the party of “white only” government. Southern 
Democrats organized at every political level from small towns to state legislatures and 
governors’ offi ces. Th eir twofold goal was to assure that, even if blacks were now free, 
they would have few rights and that whites committed to excluding blacks from power 
would dominate every aspect of society, politically, economically, and culturally. For 
these segregationist Democrats, African-Americans of the Union Leagues, scalawags, 
and carpetbaggers were all their enemies. 
Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar of Mississippi, an example of the Southern 
Democratic Party leaders of his day, was from an old elite Southern family. He represented 
Mississippi in the U.S. Congress before the war and became a staunch secessionist. 
During the war, he was a general in the Confederate army. In the postwar period, he 
decided to enter politics again. Lamar wrote to a friend, “It does seem to me that if there 
ever was a time when the white people of this state…should rise & with one unanimous 
voice protest against the domination about to be piled upon them the present is that 
time.” He proceeded to do everything he could to ensure white rule in Mississippi.

Chapter 15 Reconstruction 467 
In November 1872, having long-since secured a presidential pardon, Lamar 
won a seat in the U.S. Congress. He also helped to organize the Democratic Party in 
Mississippi. In campaign speeches, Lamar attacked black voting rights. In Congress, 
he tried to ensure that the federal government did not enforce black rights. He helped 
defeat the Enforcement Act of 1875, which would have given President Grant more 
authority to implement the Fourteenth and Fift eenth Amendments in Mississippi. 
While he was engaged in partisan politics, Lamar also helped to develop another 
political organization outside of the Democratic Party—hidden from view but 
essential to his political victory—the Ku Klux Klan. 
The Rise of Violence and the Ku Klux Klan 
Th e Ku Klux Klan was founded as a social club among Confederate veterans in Tennessee 
in 1866. It quickly turned into the largest of several secret and violent organizations 
bent on ensuring a reign of terror against not only Republican political leaders of either 
race but also teachers in black schools and blacks in general. Th e Klan was committed 
to ending Reconstruction and returning the South to white rule. Th e Klan assassinated 
Arkansas’s Congressman James M. Hinds, members of the South Carolina legislature, 
and other members of state constitutional conventions. It had only just begun its work. 
Similar organizations grew across the South. In Louisiana, the Knights of the White 
Camellia played a similar role, as did the White Line organizations in Mississippi. 
Although leaders like Lamar maintained a public distance, they secretly kept close ties 
to these violent extralegal organizations. By political organizing and sheer violence and 
intimidation, they were confi dent that they could return the South to its prewar ways. 
Even before the emergence of the KKK, African-Americans and 
their white Republican allies faced violence. Just aft er the war’s end 
in May 1866, a bloody riot in Memphis, Tennessee, which began 
when two carriages, one driven by a black and one by a white, collided. 
Th e riot resulted in the burning of black schools, churches, 
and over 90 black homes as well as the killing of at least 48 people; 
all but two of whom were black. A Memphis teacher was murdered, 
and others were told they would be killed if they did not leave the 
city immediately. Th e following fall, only 13 of the 40 teachers in 
the black schools of Memphis returned. A few weeks later, a similar 
riot in New Orleans, Louisiana, resulted in at least 100 injuries as 
well as the killing of 34 blacks and three of their white supporters. 
By the spring of 1873, what could only be described as a civil war 
was going on in Louisiana. Tension mounted aft er the November 1872 
elections in which one group of voters elected a Republican governor 
and another group, a Democratic one. When a federal judge ruled 
in favor of the Republican slate, President Grant sent troops to New 
Orleans to oust the Democratic governor and install the Republican 
administration. But in the small town of Colfax, Louisiana, two sheriffs 
had also been elected, and federal troops were a long way off. 
On Easter Sunday, April 13, 1873, tensions reached a boiling point. 
Several dozen black families along with William Ward, who was the 
Republican sheriff as well as a former slave and Union army veteran, 
barricaded themselves inside the town and sent urgent telegrams to 
the governor in New Orleans, asking for the army to rescue them. 
Help was too late in coming. Two to three hundred whites marched 
on the town, led by the Democratic sheriff, Confederate veteran 
Christopher Columbus Nash. Nash and his army attacked the town 
and killed everyone they could fi nd. At least 60 blacks, perhaps many 
more, were killed. Th e next day, witnesses saw only piles of bodies 
everywhere. Colfax was far from an isolated incident.

Some of the greatest violence was in Mississippi. On July 4, 1874, as the Republican 
Party held a meeting in Vicksburg, Mississippi, armed whites arrived and shot and killed 
many of those, white and black, in attendance. Peter Crosby, the sheriff in Vicksburg, 
demanded federal intervention, but did not get help. On September 1, 1875, at a 
Republican meeting in Yazoo City, Henry Dixon began shooting at the mixed-race gathering. 
One person was killed instantly. Before long, those who were at the meeting scattered 
and a company of organized Mississippi White Liners—the Mississippi version of 
the Klan—took over the town and forced its elected government to fl ee. 
On Election Day, the Democrats won statewide in Mississippi. In Port Gibson, black 
voters arriving at the polls were met by some 80 whites armed with Remington rifl es, who 
started fi ring at them. One old man, John Morris, was killed, six others wounded, and 
none voted. At Peytona, not a single Republican vote was cast. Democratic sentries on 
the Tombigbee River ensured that black voters could not cross the river to get to polling 
places. Governor Ames fl ed for his life before his term ended, while Democratic Party 
teams warned politically active Republicans, black and white, to leave the state before they 
were killed. Reconstruction ended in Mississippi with the 1875 elections. 
Eff orts to Defend Reconstruction 
Th e antiblack, anti-Republican violence with which the South was slowly “redeemed” 
from Reconstruction met resistance at every step, sometimes very signifi cant resistance. 
In March of 1870, just as the Fift eenth Amendment was ratifi ed, Congress also passed 
the fi rst Enforcement Act, making the denial of the right to vote because of race through 
force, fraud, bribery, or intimidation a federal crime. Up to that time, protecting voting 
rights had been completely a state issue, but in 1870, Congress had signifi cant reasons not 
to trust that all the states would protect voting rights, especially for newly enfranchised 
African-Americans. Two further Enforcement Acts gave the federal government the right 
to intervene when elections were unfair. In addition, the Ku Klux Klan Act of April 1871 
made conspiracies to deprive citizens of the right to vote a punishable federal off ense. In 
June 1870, Congress also created the U.S. Department of Justice with a specifi c mandate

Chapter 15 Reconstruction 469 
to enforce Reconstruction. (Up until then, the U.S. Attorney General had been a kind 
of in-house lawyer and legal advisor to the president and cabinet but with no agency to 
lead.) All of these acts represented a major expansion of federal power. Because of the 
new legislation, crimes against individuals could, for the fi rst time, be prosecuted by the 
federal government, especially if state governments did not step in and do their duty. 
President Grant used this legislation forcefully. In October 1871, the president 
proclaimed nine counties of South Carolina to be in a “condition of lawlessness” and 
sent federal troops to restore order and arrest several hundred Klan leaders, some of 
whom ended up serving terms in federal prison. In addition, perhaps 2,000 Klan members 
left the state. Seven hundred leaders of the Klan were also arrested in Mississippi 
and several hundred more in North Carolina. By the end of 1872, the Klan, as an organization, 
had been destroyed. 
Th e Klan would rise again, but not for many decades later. Nevertheless, despite 
its absence, violence against blacks and their white Republican allies continued in the 
1870s. In the North, people were growing more and more willing to let the South settle 
its own aff airs. When the Democrats nominated newspaper editor Horace Greeley 
for president in 1872, they adopted a platform attacking Republican corruption and 
calling for civil service reform while also promising a general amnesty for former 
Confederates and an end to federal intervention in the South. Grant was easily renominated 
by the Republicans and won the election handily, but Democrats gained power 
in Congress. As it turned out, Greeley died before the electoral votes were counted, 
which caused some confusion, but no one doubted that Grant had won the election. 
In his inaugural address at the beginning of his second term in March 1873, Grant 
told the nation, “Th e eff ects of the late civil strife have been to free the slave and make 
him a citizen. Yet he is not possessed of the civil rights which citizenship should carry 
with it. Th is is wrong, and should be corrected. To this correction I stand committed, 
so far as Executive infl uence can avail.” Grant did his best, but it was not enough. 
In 1875, Grant sent fellow Civil War General Philip Sheridan to Louisiana to investigate 
the political violence. Sheridan documented the killing of 2,141 blacks and 
the wounding of 2,115 more since the war had ended. All of these crimes remained 
unpunished. Another Civil War veteran, former slave Henry Adams, organized a committee 
of 500 blacks to “look into aff airs and see the true condition of our race.” In 
northern Louisiana around the Red River area alone, the committee documented 683 
murders, including the following notations: 
Sam Maybury, whipped to death, December 1865 
Henry West, badly whipped, November 1874 
George, a colored man, killed by white men 1873 
Nancy Brooks, badly whipped by a white man, 1873 
In most cases, the list included the name of the victim and the unpunished killer. Th e 
reality that Sheridan and Adams documented would not change for a very long time. 
A Changing National Mood and the End of Reconstruction 
A number of factors led to the growing national weariness with federal intervention 
in the South. Southern Reconstruction governments were regularly accused of 
corruption, and some offi ce holders, black and white, certainly enriched themselves. 
P.B.S. Pinchback of Louisiana, the only black governor in the Reconstruction-era, 
admitted that he made considerable profi t for himself in his political career. South 
Carolina’s white Republican Governor Robert K. Scott speculated in state bonds, 
and North Carolina’s Governor William Holden was aware of “damnable rascality.” 
In truth, the Reconstruction governments were probably no more corrupt than those 
that came before or aft er, but the charges tarnished Reconstruction. 
Th e Grant administration also faced one corruption scandal aft er another. During 
Grant’s fi rst year in offi ce, Jay Gould and James Fisk, the nation’s leading bankers, tried to 
corner the nation’s gold supply and thus control the economy, with possible support from

administration insiders including Julia Grant, the president’s wife. One aft er another, cabinet 
offi cers resigned and were replaced aft er they were charged with taking bribes or other 
forms of corruption. In 1870, former Ohio Governor Jacob Cox resigned as secretary 
of the interior to protest the administration’s failure to implement civil service reform. 
In perhaps the biggest scandal, a congressional investigation uncovered the workings of 
the so-called Whiskey Ring, a group including elected offi cials, government employees, 
and whiskey makers who defrauded the U.S. Treasury of excise taxes on whiskey. 
Over 200 distillers and revenue agents were indicted, and Grant’s personal secretary, 
Orville E. Babcock, resigned. Grant directed the investigations to continue saying, “Let no 
guilty man escape if it can be avoided,” and he ordered the Attorney General not to grant 
immunity to any suspects, but he was seriously tarnished by the widespread corruption. 
Th e sheer size of the federal interventions in the South also undermined public 
support. In late 1874, White League militants ousted the Republican governor, 
William P. Kellogg, in Louisiana and took over the legislative hall. Since Louisiana 
was still under military supervision, Grant ordered General Sheridan to restore order. 
With 5,000 U.S. Army troops, Sheridan restored Kellogg to the governor’s offi ce and 
forcibly removed Democrats from the legislative hall. The spectacle of U.S. Army 
soldiers marching into a legislative chamber and removing people who claimed 
to have been elected created a huge backlash. Newspapers that had supported the 
Union cause now compared the White League to the founding fathers defending their 
freedom from the tyranny of the British. 
Debates in Congress reflected the change in Northern public opinion and the 
increasing swagger of Southern leaders. Joseph R. Hawley, a Connecticut Republican 
who called himself a “radical abolitionist,” nevertheless argued that the “social, and 
educational, and moral reconstruction,” of the South could “never come from any 
legislative halls.” Th e Democrats in Congress praised “local self-government,” while 
insisting that black and white Republicans in the South should stop depending “upon 
external aid.” In that context, it was diffi cult for the federal administration or the U.S. 
Army offi cers in the South to get support. 
Th e U.S. Supreme Court was not sympathetic to Reconstruction. In the Slaughterhouse 
Cases of 1873, the court severely restricted the reach of the Fourteenth Amendment. A 
group of butchers in New Orleans had challenged the right of the Louisiana legislature 
to grant a monopoly to one meatpacking company because, they said, it violated their 
Fourteenth Amendment rights to due process of law and citizenship rights. But the court 
ruled that the Fourteenth Amendment did not include such rights, making it much 
harder to bring other suits about state infringement of citizen’s rights. 
In March 1876, the court’s decision in United States v. Cruikshank struck a 
further blow to Reconstruction. William J. “Bill” Cruikshank was a white participant 
in the attack on Colfax, Louisiana, in 1873. He was indicted on federal charges for 
violating the civil rights of blacks who were killed in the attack. But 3 years later, the 
Supreme Court ruled that the charges were unconstitutional. Chief Justice Morrison 
R. Waite wrote that protecting the rights of individual citizens was a state, not a 
federal duty. Cruikshank took away one of the federal government’s most important 
enforcement powers—the right to bring federal charges against those who attacked 
the basic rights of African-Americans. 
Finally, in 1883, the court ruled that the Civil Rights Act of 1875 was 
unconstitutional because the Fourteenth Amendment gave Congress only the right 
to outlaw state government actions, not discrimination by individuals, which the 
court left to the states to deal with. Th e legal foundation of Reconstruction seemed to 
be crumbling or, perhaps, the court was simply following public opinion. Associate 
Justice Samuel Miller, a Grant appointee, wrote to a friend, describing what many 
Americans were also feeling, “I am losing interest in these matters.” 
As the country prepared for the 1876 presidential elections, the loss of interest in 
Reconstruction was evident. Th e Republicans nominated Ohio Governor Rutherford 
B. Hayes, who was on good terms with all factions in the party and especially popular 
15.3

Chapter 15 Reconstruction 471 
with some because of his crackdown on nascent labor unions in Ohio. Th e platform 
said surprisingly little about Reconstruction. Th e Democrats nominated New York 
Governor Samuel Tilden, who had made a fortune as legal counsel for some of the 
country’s richest bankers and railroads and gained fame for fi ghting corruption in government. 
Promising to continue the fi ght against corruption and foster prosperity, and 
never mentioning Reconstruction, Tilden was the strongest candidate the Democrats 
had nominated in some time. 
Th e campaign was intense, especially in the South where violence and confusion 
reigned. In November, Tilden outpolled Hayes, winning the popular vote 4,286,808 
to 4,034,142, but it was the electoral votes that counted. In three states, Florida, 
Louisiana, and South Carolina, Republican election boards discarded enough votes 
to declare Hayes the winner, which meant that he would also win the electoral count. 
Not surprisingly, the Democrats challenged these decisions. 
Th e months between the election and the inauguration were as tense as any since 
the Jefferson–Adams contest of 1800. Some Democrats vowed “Tilden or War.” 
Congress created an Electoral Commission of 10 congressional representatives, fi ve 
from each party plus fi ve Supreme Court justices, to determine the outcome since 
the Constitution gave no guidance beyond saying that the votes “shall be counted” 
in the Senate. Aft er intense negotiations, the Electoral Commission ruled 8 to 7 for 
Hayes. But the Constitution specifi ed that a president could not be declared elected 
until the Senate actually counted the votes cast by the presidential electors from the 
various states. Democrats refused to convene the Senate to count that vote, thus making 
it impossible to resolve the crisis. Finally on February 26, a group of Southern 
Democrats met with Ohio Republicans and negotiated a compromise. Hayes, who 
promised to treat the South with “kind consideration,” agreed that, if he were made 
President, he would use his power to end Reconstruction, most of all by withdrawing 
the federal troops that were in the South protecting Republican governments. Th e 
Southern Democrats liked the off er and agreed to let the Senate meet and count the 
votes including—following the Electoral Commission’s recommendation—the votes 
of the Republican electors from Florida. On Inauguration Day, March 4, 1877, Hayes 
became president and moved quickly to fulfi ll his promises. 
Southern Republicans who had supported Hayes were outraged. A former slave 
from South Carolina commented angrily, “To think that Hayes could go back on us 
when we had to wade through blood to help place him where he is now.” Little could 
now be done, however. Hayes did not immediately remove federal troops from the 
South, but he made it clear that the troops who remained would not intervene in the 
South’s internal matters as Grant had ordered. Th e changes in federal policy had been 
coming for some time, but after March 1877, there was little reason to expect any 
federal support for Reconstruction anywhere. 
After 1877, the direction was clear. John C. Calhoun, an Arkansas planter and 
grandson of the South Carolina senator of the same name, told Congress that “left 
to ourselves,” the white South could settle “all questions” about the region’s political 
arrangements. And they did. Blacks, carpetbaggers, and scalawags were slowly excluded 
from offi ces, though some stayed on into the 1890s. Many were forced to leave the South 
altogether if they wanted long lives. In addition, blacks were excluded from voting altogether, 
education budgets were slashed, and the regulation of sharecropping shift ed further 
in favor of plantation owners. Aft er 1877, white rule in the South was assured. 
The Birth of the Segregated South 
Disenfranchisement and segregation did not happen overnight. African-Americans 
were still being elected to offi ce in the 1880s and 1890s. George H. White of North 
Carolina, who was described as “the last of the Negro congressmen,” bade a final 
farewell to the House of Representatives in 1901 saying: “Th is, Mr. Chairman, this is 
perhaps the Negroes’ temporary farewell to the American Congress. But let me say, 
phoenix-like, he will rise up someday and come again.” Th e absence of blacks from

Congress lasted for 28 years until Oscar De Priest was elected from Chicago. Only 
aft er another civil rights movement many decades later did African-Americans reach 
the number of representatives in Congress that they had in the 1870s. 
Various forms of what came to be called Jim Crow segregation developed at a rapid 
pace. (Jim Crow was a derogatory character in a minstrel show designed to denigrate 
blacks, but his name has been applied to the whole era of rigid racial segregation that was 
the rule in many parts of the United States from the 1870s to the 1960s.) Schools, public 
facilities, transportation, and most every other aspect of life were segregated. In addition 
to losing the vote, blacks were marginalized economically so that sharecropping became 
virtually the only option for most. A vicious campaign of lynching controlled blacks 
through fear and intimidation. Perhaps the capstone of this segregation was the U.S. 
Supreme Court’s 1896 Plessy v. Ferguson decision that “separate by equal” facilities were 
quite acceptable under the United States Constitution. By the time that decision was 
issued, the high hopes of Reconstruction were a dim memory and most Americans— 
white and black—were living in a very diff erent world. 
15.3 
Quick Review Considering the events and trends of the later years of Reconstruction, or 
Redemption as it was called, who were the winners and who were the losers? Who was 
most responsible for what happened? 
CONCLUSION 
During the 12 years aft er the Civil War, Americans grappled with what the future held 
for newly freed slaves and how best to return to the Union those states that had been in 
rebellion during the Civil War. Th e so-called Radical Republicans in Congress sought 
ways to protect the educational, political, and economic rights of the freedmen—as 
former slaves, male and female, were called. Andrew Johnson, who became president 
upon Lincoln’s death in April 1865, seemed indiff erent to African-American rights and 
soon alienated congressional radicals by restoring power to former rebels intent on 
limiting the freedoms of former slaves. 
Congressional Republicans had their own plans for consolidating the Union victory, 
however, and eventually, the House of Representatives impeached Johnson for obstructing 
its plans to reconstruct the South. Although he was acquitted of “high crimes and 
misdemeanors” by the Senate, which allowed him to stay in offi ce, Johnson’s political 
career was over. But Congress passed a number of laws, including the 1866 Civil Rights 
Act and the Fourteenth and Fift eenth Amendments to the Constitution, designed to 
protect black rights as citizens and voters. Across the South, African-Americans and 
whites committed to Reconstruction were elected to local and national offi ce in larger 
numbers and began to reshape their states. In 1868, Ulysses S. Grant, the Republican 
nominee, was elected president. Grant was committed to the Reconstruction of the 
South in ways that would protect black rights, especially black voting rights. 
Aft er the war, African-Americans pursued full citizenship rights, education, and 
economic independence. Terrorized by white supremacists and lacking money and 
credit, most African-Americans never achieved either true equality or independence. 
At the same time, white veterans of the Confederate army were organizing to deny those 
rights, not only legally through the Democratic Party but also illegally through the Ku 
Klux Klan and other similar organizations. As time passed, and as public support for 
federal intervention in the aff airs of the South eroded, the promise of Reconstruction’s 
early days evaporated. By 1877, a new president, Rutherford B. Hayes, began to bring 
Reconstruction to an end, assuring white rule in the South and the disenfranchisement 
and “Jim Crow segregation” of African-Americans for generations to come.

Chapter 15 Summary and Review 
Preparing to Write: Create a Time Line 
It is oft en helpful to establish a time line of critical events when 
seeking to understand complicated political and diplomatic 
developments. With this point in mind, create a time line of 
key events in the history of Reconstruction from Andrew 
Johnson’s announcement of his plans for Reconstruction on 
May 29, 1865, to the ratifi cation of the Fift eenth Amendment 
in February 1870. 
THE IMPACT OF RECONSTRUCTION 
15.2 
Explain the impact of Reconstruction on African-American life 
in the South. 
Summary 
During the era of Congressional Reconstruction, African- 
Americans were elected to a variety of offi ces at the state and 
federal level. Reconstruction state governments expanded the 
right to vote, created public school systems, and promoted 
internal improvements designed to bring the South into the 
modern world. For many newly freed slaves, education was the 
highest priority. Along with education and the right to vote, 
former slaves sought land and the economic independence that 
with it. In the end, the federal government did not support the 
redistribution of land to former slaves, and a system of sharecropping 
emerged. While sharecropping was initially seen as 
a compromise between white and black economic desires, it 
quickly became a system through which whites could economically 
dominate blacks. 
Review Questions

Reconstruction? What aspects of those years would a historian 
report to emphasize Congressional Reconstruction as 
a failure? 
5. Contextualization 
Why did newly freed slaves place such a high priority on 
education? 
6. Constructing Arguments 
Defend or refute the following statement. “By the end of the 
1870s, from an economic perspective, most Southern blacks 
were almost as closely tied to the land and dependent on 
white landowners as they had been under slavery.” What

Explain the political development of federal Reconstruction 
policy. 
Summary 
In the immediate aft ermath of Lincoln’s assassination, Andrew 
Johnson took the lead in Reconstruction. His goal was to return 
the Confederate states to their prewar status as quickly as possible, 
and he had no interest in the political rights of former slaves 
as long as slavery itself was ended. New state governments were 
quickly organized in the South and began passing laws limiting 
black rights. When a new, and overwhelmingly Republican, 
Congress was assembled in December 1865, it enacted a radical 
vision of Reconstruction that put it at odds with the president. 
Johnson vetoed the extension and expansion of the Freedmen’s 
Bureau and the Civil Rights Act of 1866, but Congress overrode 
his vetoes. Th e Fourteenth Amendment put the provisions of 
the Civil Rights law into the Constitution. Th e Reconstruction 
Act of 1867 divided the former Confederate states into five 
military districts, ordering the military to oversee the writing 
of new constitutions. Only aft er these new constitutions were in 
place, and aft er a state had ratifi ed the Fourteenth Amendment, 
would Congress admit its representatives to Congress. 
Congressional efforts to prevent Johnson from undermining 
Reconstruction intensifi ed the confrontation between Congress 
and the president and led to his impeachment and trial. Aft er 
Grant was elected president in 1868, Congress moved quickly 
to pass the Fift eenth Amendment, guaranteeing blacks the right 
to vote. Supporters of women’s rights were disappointed in the 
Fift eenth Amendment because their own voting rights had not 
been considered. 
Review Questions 
1. Historical Interpretation 
What do Johnson’s policies before his impeachment tell us 
about his vision of the post-Reconstruction South? 
2. Constructing Arguments 
How would you explain the increasingly radical nature 
of Congressional Reconstruction? What factors pushed 
Congress toward more aggressive intervention in Southern 
society and politics? 
3. Comparison 
Compare and contrast Presidential Reconstruction and 
Congressional Reconstruction. What were some of the ways 
that Congress forced the states of the former Confederacy 
to accept Reconstruction that Johnson opposed?

Nonetheless, Reconstruction suff ered a series of setbacks in the 
1870s as Northern whites lost interest in and commitment to the 
protection of the rights of Southern blacks. Th e Compromise 
of 1876, which resulted in the election of Rutherford B. Hayes, 
effectively ended Reconstruction. In the decades after 1876, 
discrimination and disfranchisement led to the emergence of 
the segregated South. 
Review Questions 
7. Contextualization 
What groups made up the Republican coalition during 
Reconstruction? What did each group hope to gain from its 
support of the party? 
8. Historical Interpretation 
Is it fair to describe the Democratic Party during 
Reconstruction as the party of white supremacy? Why or 
why not? 
9. Constructing Arguments 
Defend or refute the following statement. “The Ku Klux 
Klan of the Reconstruction era was, at its essence, a terrorist 
organization.” 
Preparing to Write: Write a Conclusion 
An essay should include a conclusion that wraps up the arguments 
laid out in your essay. Suppose you wanted to write an 
essay on the factors that brought to an end federal intervention 
on behalf of Southern blacks. Make a list of the key points you 
might make in the conclusion to such an essay. 
Preparing to Write: Organizing Evidence 
Historians agree that newly freed slaves had three major priorities 
aft er the Civil War: voting, education, and the acquisition of 
land and economic independence. Make a three-column table 
describing the eff orts of Southern blacks to make progress in 
each of these three areas. 
TERROR, APATHY, AND THE CREATION OF THE 
SEGREGATED SOUTH 
15.3 
Analyze the reasons Reconstruction ended and the impact of 
Redemption. 
Summary 
The first decade after the Civil War witnessed extraordinary 
changes, particularly in the lives of black Americans in the 
South, but few of these advances lasted long. Th e Republican 
Party in the South was made up of a coalition of blacks, 
Southern whites who supported Republican and multiracial 
efforts, and Northern white migrants to the South. In contrast, 
the Democratic Party was supported by the majority of 
white Southerners. Organizations like the Ku Klux Klan used 
political violence and terror to prevent blacks from using their 
rights or resisting attempts by whites to reimpose the prewar 
racial order. Among white Southerners, violent resistance to 
Reconstruction and to any role of blacks in government became 
common across the South in the 1870s. Th at violence played 
a central role in the “redemption” of Southern state governments 
by the Democrats. Under Grant, the federal government 
took a forceful role in resisting and punishing the violence.

Questions 5.1–5.3 refer to the following document. 
Th ere are few things which present greater obstacles to the 
improvement and elevation of woman to her appropriate sphere 
of usefulness and duty, than the laws which have been enacted to 
destroy her independence, and crush her individuality; laws which, 
although they are framed for her government, she has had no voice 
in establishing, and which rob her of some of her essential rights. 
Woman has no political existence. With the single exception of 
presenting a petition to the legislative body, she is a cipher in the 
nation; or, if not actually so in representative governments, she is 
only counted, like the slaves of the South, to swell the number of lawmakers 
who form decrees for her government, with little reference to 
her benefi t, except so far as her good may promote their own. . . .

Questions 5.8–5.10 refer to the following document. 
Th e negro slaves of the South are the happiest, and, in some 
sense, the freest people in the world. Th e children and the aged 
and infi rm work not at all, and yet have all the comforts and 
necessities of life provided for them. Th ey enjoy liberty, because 
they are oppressed neither by care nor labor. Th e women do 
little hard work, and are protected from the despotism of their 
husbands by their masters. Th e negro men and stout boys work, 
on the average, in good weather, not more than nine hours a day. 
Th e balance of their time is spent in perfect abandon. Besides, 
they have their Sabbaths and holidays. White men, with so much 
of license and liberty, would die of ennui; but negroes luxuriate 
in corporeal and mental repose. . . . We do not know whether 
free laborers ever sleep. . . . Th e free laborer must work or starve. 
He is more of a slave than the negro, because he works longer 
and harder for less allowance than the slave, and has no holiday, 
because the cares of life with him begin when its labors end. He 
has no liberty, and not a single right.

Questions 5.11–5.13 refer to the following document. 
As both the North and the South mobilized for war, the relative 
strengths and weaknesses of the “free market” and the “slave 
labor” economic systems became increasingly clear—particularly 
in their ability to support and sustain a war economy. Th e 
Union’s industrial and economic capacity soared during the war 
as the North continued its rapid industrialization to suppress 
the rebellion. In the South, a smaller industrial base, fewer rail 
lines, and an agricultural economy based upon slave labor made 
mobilization of resources more diffi cult. As the war dragged on, 
the Union’s advantages in factories, railroads, and manpower put 
the Confederacy at a great disadvantage.

the benefi cent purposes which the people of the United States 
had in view when they adopted the recent amendments of the 
constitution, by one of which the blacks of this country were

Confl ict in the West 
In the midst of the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln worried about the 
potential for alliances between the Confederate States and some western 
Indian tribes. He met with 14 western chiefs at the White House in 
March 1863. He did not off er much but urged them to adopt the “peaceful 
ways of the white people.” Chief Lean Bear of the Cheyenne reminded the 
president that whites were responsible for most of the violence in the West. 
He did not mention the irony of Lincoln’s statement coming in the midst of 
the bloodiest war in American history. 
Subsequent presidents had similar, usually unproductive, meetings. 
President Grant tried hard to implement what came to be known as the 
Grant Peace Policy, but, though well intentioned, that policy ultimately 
depended on the U.S. Army to settle matters in the West, and the army in 
the fi eld was oft en anything but peaceful. While the most intense interaction 
between white settlers and Indian tribes east of the Mississippi River 
lasted for over 200 years, the major battles between the western tribes and 
the U.S. Army lasted for less than 30 years. What began as a series of bloody 
skirmishes during the Civil War erupted into the Great Plains Wars in the 
1870s and 1880s. By the 1890s, the armed confl ict was all over as tribes were 
defeated and moved into ever shrinking reservations. 
At the same time, white ranchers, farmers, and miners built new 
settlements across the West. What began as great cattle ranches were 
replaced within 30 years by smaller-scale farms producing beef and wheat 
for national and world markets. These agricultural developments of the 
Buff alo Bill’s Wild West Show created the image of the American West for many people, 
which was more fantasy than reality.

post–Civil War era depended on new technologies—most of all the development of 
railroads that brought supplies to isolated farmers and shipped their products—and 
on new economic and political arrangements. Th is chapter examines the growth and 
changing nature of the American West between 1865 and 1890. 
THE TRIBES OF THE WEST AND THE U.S. GOVERNMENT 
Explain western development from an Indian perspective and the way Indian and white 
cultures shaped each other. 
Native Americans fought on both sides in the Civil War and sometimes used the 
country’s division to expand their territory, forcing both North and South to divert 
troops from other battles. Th e Civil War also changed the lives of American Indians. 
For most whites, however, Indian matters existed only on the margin of their attention 
during the war. Once the Civil War ended, white’s relationships with Indian tribes, 
especially on the Great Plains, took on greater significance. As many Americans, 
whites and some blacks, began to look for more land in the aft ermath of the war, they 
ran directly into newly empowered Indian tribes. 
The Comanche Empire 
For the Comanches, arguably the most powerful tribe on the western frontier in 1860, 
the Civil War was a great gift . Th e U.S. Army, the Texas Rangers, and other whites who 
had been harassing them for decades were called to fi ght against each other on distant 
battlefi elds. Th e Comanches welcomed their absence. 
In 1700, the Comanches were a small tribe who had recently moved into what is 
now the Southwest of the United States. Th ey developed expertise using two European 
imports, rifl es and horses, becoming the much-feared “Lords of the South Plains.” Th e 
Comanches built a way of life based on hunting the buff alo, and like the buff alo, they 
traveled widely over the Great Plains. Th ey also made alliances (especially with the 
Utes), traded (with everyone), and fought bloody battles (especially with the Apaches 
and the Europeans) while they stole horses and supplies as well as kidnapped settlers 
and people from other tribes. By the early 1800s, although they were without a permanent 
capital, borders, or bureaucracy, the Comanches ruled an empire that was equal 
in size and power to the United States or the Republic of Mexico. 
Nevertheless, by the late 1850s, the Comanches seemed to be in decline. Working 
with Texas Rangers and with smaller tribes who had been Comanche victims, the U.S. 
Army began to gain the upper hand in Texas. Th e Comanches needed ample space for 
hunting, trading, and fi ghting; they had no interest in being settled in any permanent 
locations. In battles during 1858, over 100 Comanche warriors, including chiefs, were 
killed and a large number of women and children taken prisoner. Some Comanches 
were ready to seek peace. Th e Penateka Comanches, who had split from the larger 
tribe, gave up warfare and settled on a Texas reservation just before the Civil War. 
Th e Civil War and, later, Reconstruction, opened up new opportunities for the 
Comanches. Th e war diverted troops from Texas to distant battlefi elds, and as early 
as 1863, Comanche raiding parties began to move back into parts of Texas they had 
left in the 1850s, stealing horses and cattle. When Texas joined the Confederacy, 
Comanches developed a brisk trade selling stolen Texas cattle to Union Army agents 
in New Mexico. With the coming of peace in 1865, the U.S. Army demilitarized 
any forces in Texas that had fought for the Confederacy in the Civil War, including 
the feared Texas Rangers. While U.S. Army troops were stationed in Houston, San 
Antonio, and along the border with Mexico, west Texas, with several million cattle 
wandering on huge range lands, was only lightly protected. Th e Comanche saw their 
opportunity. Th ey developed a rich trade with prosperous New Mexicans who came 
to be known as the comancheros because of the trade.

From the mid-1860s into the early 1870s, great annual trading gatherings took place 
where comancheros , oft en backed by investors from the eastern United States, traded 
salt, hard bread, fl our, sugar, tobacco, blankets, and knives as well as the ever-in-demand 
latest issue revolvers and rifl es in exchange for cattle that the Comanches had recently 
acquired in Texas. Th e Comanches also continued to trade in people—Mexican and 
Indian captives, especially women, who were in great demand as brides in New Mexico. 
While these trading gatherings integrated the Comanches into U.S. markets, the stolen 
cattle and the continued trade in humans were sources of serious tensions between the 
Comanches and the governments of the United States and the state of Texas. 
To restore order to the Southwest and open up new land for white settlement, 
U.S. peace commissioners met with more than 5,000 Comanches as well as Kiowas, 
Naishans, Cheyennes, and Arapahoes at Medicine Lodge Creek in Texas in October 
1867. Th e U.S. delegation was led by William Tecumseh Sherman, head of the army 
of the West, a post he had also held during the Civil War. As a show of strength, the 
army team included 500 well-armed soldiers in dress uniform. A newspaper reporter 
also at the meeting wrote that the Comanches arrived “with all their war paraphernalia, 
their horses striped with war paint, the riders bedecked with war bonnets and their 
faces painted red.” Th ey also knew a thing or two about a show of strength. 
After elaborate opening ceremonies and the exchanges of gifts—including 6,000 
pounds of coff ee, 10,000 pounds of bread, and 3,000 pounds of tobacco from the government—
the U.S. representatives made it clear they had come to Medicine Lodge Creek 
to end the Comanche status as a sovereign people. Th e government would help them 
become farmers on a reservation, but would not tolerate a continuation of the old hunting, 
trading, and stealing ways. Sherman concluded, “You can no more stop this [change] 
than you can stop the sun or the moon. You must submit and do the best you can.” 
The Comanche chiefs were outraged by the government’s demands. Several, 
including Paruasemena, the leader of the Penateka Comanches, expressed their anger 
in eloquent responses, but in the end, the chiefs signed a treaty, although it was one 
that left much open to interpretation. Th e Medicine Lodge Creek Treaty provided for 
a Comanche reservation but also gave them the right to hunt on open plains below 
the Arkansas River in Indian Territory (Oklahoma). Th e government representatives 
assumed that the Comanches would become farmers on the reservation while venturing 
out on occasional hunting trips to track the buff alo. Th e Comanches thought 
that the reservation would make a perfectly good winter campground, and they were 
more than happy to receive government rations, but they had no intention of becoming 
settled farmers. Along with hunting buff alo, the Comanches expected to continue 
hunting for Texas cattle and trading them to New Mexico buyers. 
Th e radically diff erent interpretations of the Medicine Lodge Creek Treaty between 
the Comanches and the U.S. government became clear the next spring when several 
thousand Comanches, having spent the winter on the reservation, collected their government 
payments and began raiding cattle and horses in Texas, New Mexico, and 
Indian Territory. According to one report, 6,255 horses and 11,395 cattle were lost to 
Indian raids in Texas between 1866 and 1873. 
Aft er several unsuccessful peace eff orts, the United States gave up on negotiations and 
ordered the army to attack and force the Comanches onto a permanent reservation. From 
1871 to 1873, the army and the Comanches fought. While the army attacked, American 
buff alo hunters decimated the buff alo herds as industries found new uses for their hides. 
Th e buff alo had been at the heart of Comanche life, not only as food but also as a way to 
understand the universe, and their destruction undermined the Comanche way of life. 
During the fi ghting from 1871 to 1873 a new Comanche leader emerged. Quanah 
Parker was the son of a Comanche chief and Ann Cynthia Parker, a white Texan who 
had been captured by the Comanches. He became the fi ercest opponent of compromise 
with whites. Th en in 1874, Isa-tai, a young Comanche spiritual leader or shaman, 
became prominent, sharing a message heard many times among diff erent Indian 
tribes—that if they would get rid of white ways and end their dealings with white

Paruasemena was one of the Indian leaders to visit Lincoln at the 
White House in 1863. Four years later, the 75-year-old leader 
spoke to the U.S. peace commission at Medicine Lodge Creek. The 
passion and pathos of the speech touched many. 
My people have never first drawn a bow or fired a gun against 
the whites. There has been trouble between us…my young men 
have danced the war dance. But it was not begun by us. It was 
you who sent out the first soldier.… 
Two years ago I came upon this road, following the buffalo, 
that my wives and children might have their cheeks plump and 
their bodies warm. But the soldiers fired on us…The blue-dressed 
soldiers and the Utes came out from the night…and for campfires 
they lit our lodges. Instead of hunting game they killed my braves, 
and the warriors of the tribe cut short their hair for the dead. 
So it was in Texas. They made sorrow in our camps, and we 
went out like the buffalo bulls when the cows are attacked. When 
we found them we killed them, and their scalps hang in our 
lodges. The Comanches are not weak and blind, like the pups of 
a dog when seven sleeps old. They are strong and farsighted, like 
grown horses. We took their road and we went on it. The white 
women cried, and our women laughed. 
But there are things which you have said to me which I do not 
like. They were not sweet like sugar, but bitter like gourds. You have 
said that you want to put us on a reservation, to build us houses and 
make us medicine lodges. I do not want them. I was born under the 
prairie, where the wind blew free and there was nothing to break 
the light of the sun. I was born where there were no enclosures and 
everything drew a free breath. I want to die there and not within 
walls. I know every stream and wood between the Rio Grande and 
the Arkansas. I have hunted and lived over that country. I live like 
my fathers before me and like them I lived happily. 
When I was in Washington the Great Father told me that all the 
Comanche land was ours and that no one should hinder us in living 
upon it. So, why do you ask us to leave the rivers and the sun and the 
wind and live in houses? Do not ask us to give up the buffalo for the 
sheep. The young men have heard talk of this, and it has made them 
sad and angry. Do not speak of it more. I love to carry out the talk I 
get from the Great Father. When I get goods and presents I and my 
people feel glad, since it shows that he holds us in his eye. 
If the Texans had kept out of my country, there might have 
been peace. But that which you now say we must live in, is too 
small. The Texans have taken away the places where the grass 
grew the thickest and the timber was best. Had we kept that, we 
might have done the things you ask. But it is too late. The whites 
have the country which we loved, and we wish only to wander 
on the prairie til we die.

people, the buff alo would return and life would be good again. In a great camp meeting 
in June 1874, several hundred Comanche warriors led by Isa-tai and Parker joined 
with Kiowas, Cheyennes, and Arapahoes to eliminate the white presence from the 
Great Plains. Th e Comanche attacked the buff alo hunters. 
Th e army counterattacked. On September 28, 1874, U.S. forces attacked Parker’s main 
encampment, and though nearly all of the Indians fl ed, the army destroyed the camp, taking 
the horses and burning tents, blankets, and food. Faced with starvation, the Comanches 
began to surrender in small groups, coming to the army post at Fort Sill in Indian Territory 
over the course of the winter where they gave up their horses and rifl es and moved to the 
reservations assigned to them. Isa-tai was discredited among the Comanches from then on. 
Th e winter of 1874–75 was the low point of Comanche life, but it was not the end. 
Quannah Parker was only 27 when he surrendered to federal authorities. Over the next 
4 decades, he became principal chief of the Comanches and led them from warfare 
to farming and ranching. Parker was a tough negotiator with the federal Bureau of 
Indian Aff airs for expanded land allotments. He had eight wives, built a fi ne 10-room 
house, and before he died he had his own telephone, owned a car, traveled by train, 
and went hunting with President Th eodore Roosevelt. Th e life Parker and his people 
lived as he grew older was radically diff erent from the life he had lived as a youth, but 
he helped create the foundation for tribal survival in a new era.

The Navajos and the Apaches 
Th e Navajos, or Diné as they prefer to be called, were as warlike as the Comanches and 
dominated large swaths of New Mexico, Colorado, and Kansas. Th e Union army ended 
their rule and that of the Mescalero Apaches, too. In August 1862, Union Brigadier 
General James H. Carleton arrived in New Mexico in command of California volunteers, 
but when he learned that Confederates in the region had already been defeated, he ordered 
his troops to attack the Apaches and Navajos instead. In early 1863, the army invaded 
Apache lands and soon confined some 400 Apaches at a new reservation at Bosque 
Redondo in central New Mexico. Carleton then appointed Kit Carson to lead the attack 
on the much larger Navajo tribe of some 10,000 people. Carson told the Navajos, “Go to 
Bosque Redondo, or we will pursue and destroy you. We will not make peace with you 
on any other terms.” Carson kept his word, marching into Canyon de Chelly, the sacred 
Navajo heartland, attacking Navajo encampments as well as destroying orchards, crops, 
and livestock. By the spring of 1864, some 6,000 Navajos had surrendered rather than 
die of starvation. U.S. troops pursued other resisters, and eventually 8,000 Navajos were 
forced on the “Long Walk,” 300 miles south to a strange way of life at Bosque Redondo. 
Th e Bosque Redondo reservation was a complete failure. Th e Mescalero Apaches considered 
the Navajos to be their “inveterate enemies,” and the two tribes had no interest in 
cooperating. Th e arid land of mid New Mexico could not support thousands of families, 
even if they did turn to farming as the government asked them to do. In addition, the 
Comanches saw the confi ned reservation as an opportunity to attack old enemies. 
Aft er the Civil War, a congressional peace commission visited Bosque Redondo and 
realized that the government had created a disaster. On June 1, 1868, they signed a new 
treaty with the Navajos that allowed them to return to a reservation in their own homelands. 
A new Mescalero Apaches reservation in central New Mexico was established by 
executive order in 1873 and expanded in 1883. Navajo leaders negotiated several expansions 
of their reservation between 1868 and 1886 so it covered a large part of New Mexico 
and Arizona up to the four corners area with Colorado and Utah. Th ey also managed 
to avoid the division of the reservation into individual allotments that destroyed tribal 
ways for other tribes. With the shared experience of suff ering at Bosque Redondo and the 
substantial new lands, the Navajo tribe had become the Navajo Nation. Th ey kept their 
promise to stop raiding and recreated much of their old ways, living on lands they considered 
sacred and making a living by herding sheep, goats, and horses. Th e tribe grew 
from 10,000 in 1864 to 30,000 in 1900, an unusual experience for American Indians.

The Modocs, the Nez Perce, and the Pacifi c Coast Tribes 
Well before the Civil War, the rapid infl ux of white settlers who came to California with 
the gold rush was a catastrophe for the many small tribes that dotted the state. The 
California tribes had already been weakened by decades of Spanish and Mexican eff orts 
to turn them into workers on the missions and the large rancheros of the state. Th e new 
American presence only made things worse. Federal commissioners negotiated treaties 
with 139 tribes to create small reservations, mostly in northern California, but Congress 
did not ratify the treaties and white settlers ignored them. In spite of the eff orts of federal 
Indian agents to create reasonable safeguards for the Indians of California, settlers 
and miners ignored restrictions on Indian land if they thought they could fi nd gold or 
plant a settlement. California Indians were starved and all too oft en simply murdered. 
In 1845, before the United States took control of California, there were some 150,000 
Indians in California—down from probably 300,000 when the Spanish missionaries 
fi rst arrived; just a decade aft er California became a state, only 25,000 remained. 
In the fall of 1872, Kintpuash, a leader of the Modoc tribe in southern Oregon and 
northern California, led his people out of a reservation the Modocs had shared with 
the Klamaths and Snakes since signing a treaty in 1864. Kintpuash did not like reservation 
life, and the Modocs returned to their homelands on Lost River in California. 
Th e U.S. Army followed and attacked them, but the Modocs knew the territory, especially 
the great black lava fields that provided hiding to those who had grown up 
among them. Th e Modocs resisted, killing soldiers, settlers, and government negotiators. 
Orders came from Washington “that the name of Modoc should cease,” because 
they had violated their treaty and killed federal negotiators. Eventually, the army won. 
Surviving Modocs were relocated in Indian Territory far from their homeland. 
Th e Nez Perce, the tribe without whom Lewis and Clark would have perished, had 
long lived in Oregon and Idaho, but they were a deeply divided tribe. One group, known 
as the “progressives,” signed a treaty in 1855 agreeing to live on a large reservation in 
Idaho. Another group, the so-called “nonprogressives,” refused. Th ey lived independently 
in an area encompassing the Salmon River in Idaho and the Snake River in Oregon. 
For some time, the nonprogressive Nez Perce were allowed to live in peace, but as 
white settlement grew in the Snake River’s fertile Wallowa Valley, pressure came to 
force them and their leader Chief Joseph, or Hin-mah-too-yah-lat-kekt, onto the Idaho 
Reservation. Th ey resisted, but by 1877, the Nez Perce knew they could no longer live 
unmolested in the Wallowa Valley. Th ey began a long retreat to preserve their independence, 
a retreat that turned into a well-chronicled but tragic journey. Initially, the Nez 
Perce moved east across the Bitterroot Mountains into Montana hoping to fi nd sanctuary 
with the Crow or Sioux. Th en they turned north, hoping to cross into Canada. All 
along the way, the U.S. Army pursued them. Finally, when they were less than 40 miles 
from Canada, the army caught up. A few escaped across the border, but the majority, 
led by Chief Joseph, surrendered. Th e chief said, “I am tired of fi ghting. Our chiefs are 
killed.…It is cold and we have no blankets. Th e little children are freezing to death.…My 
heart is sick and sad. From where the sun now stands, I will fi ght no more forever.” Most 
of those who had made the long journey with Chief Joseph ended up on a reservation 
in Indian Territory, although some, eventually including Chief Joseph, were allowed to 
return to the Pacifi c Northwest but never to their ancestral lands (see Map 16-1 ). 
The Lakota Sioux—From Fort Laramie to the Little Big Horn and 
Wounded Knee 
Th e Sioux, by far the largest group of tribes in the northern Great Plains, also fought 
fi erce battles with the U.S. Army. Teton and Santee Sioux had been embroiled with U.S. 
settlers and army troops through the 1860s, but the largest battles of the 1870s were 
with the powerful Lakota Sioux. 
In December 1866, the Lakota attacked and killed U.S. troops. Rather than 
risk further fi ghting, the government sought peace with the Lakota as well as their 
Chief Joseph of the Nez Perce who led the epic 
journey of his people.

Cheyenne and Arapaho allies. In the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie, the Lakota Sioux, 
led by Red Cloud, promised to avoid war, and the army agreed to abandon three 
provocatively placed forts. (An earlier Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851 was negotiated 
simply to keep peace between the tribes and give the U.S. Army and settlers rightsof-
way across the plains to California and Oregon.) Although the 1868 Fort Laramie 
Treaty could be seen as a victory for the Sioux, one faction, led by Sitting Bull, derided 
the treaty, reservation life, and the government annuities that were promised, saying 
to those who signed, “You are fools to make yourselves slaves to a piece of fat bacon, 
some hard-tack, and a little sugar and coff ee.” Indeed, the treaty that Sitting Bull criticized 
did not protect the Lakota or the other tribes involved. 
Less than a decade aft er the treaty was signed, when gold was discovered in the 
Black Hills and miners and settlers descended on the region, the government ordered 
the Lakota to leave winter camps and settle near the agency headquarters. Th e Lakota 
resisted. Th e Great Sioux War of 1876–77 had begun. 
General George Armstrong Custer led a battalion of troops in an attack on the 
Sioux who were refusing to move. At the Little Bighorn River on June 25, 1876, Custer 
and his troops were surrounded by a much larger force of Sioux and Cheyennes. 
None of the army troops survived. It was perhaps the most famous Indian victory, but 
that success was soon followed by defeat. Less than a month aft er the Little Bighorn 
battle, General Philip Sheridan led a huge force that attacked and defeated the Sioux. 
Th e government then broke up the Great Sioux Reserve in the Black Hills of Dakota 
Territory, creating six much smaller reservations: Standing Rock, Cheyenne River, 
Lower Brule, Crow Creek, Pine Ridge, and Rosebud, while giving some of the best 
land, now declared “surplus,” to white settlers and miners.

Th e defeats of 1876–77, along with the destruction of the great buff alo herds, led 
to an era of depression, disease, and poverty for the Sioux. A little more than a decade 
later, in 1890, the religious phenomenon that had been seen among other tribes 
appeared among the Sioux. A spiritual leader, Wovoka, initiated the Ghost Dance 
movement, promising a return of the buff alo and the disappearance of white people 
if only the Sioux would take up the dance and return to their ancient ways, freeing 
themselves of dependence on white culture. Th e rise of the Ghost Dance frightened 
the white community, and the army was sent to Pine Ridge to investigate. A former 
Indian agent, Valentine McGillycuddy, appealed for calm saying, “I should let the 
dance continue.…If the Seventh-Day Adventists prepare their ascension robes for the 
second coming of the Savior, the United States Army is not put in motion to prevent 
them. Why should not the Indians have the same privilege?” 
McGillycuddy also warned that “If the troops remain, trouble is sure to come.” 
He was right. One band of Sioux under the leadership of Big Foot left the reservation 
while the Ghost Dance continued, and U.S. troops went aft er them. When Big Foot 
and his band were caught, they returned to Pine Ridge without a fi ght but maintained 
their freedom. Th e next day, however, those who had followed Big Foot were asked 
to surrender themselves as prisoners. Ghost Dance leaders convinced them to make a 
stand. It was a fatal move. Gunfi re erupted on the reservation and between 100 and 200 
(some estimate as high as 300) Indians were killed. Armed Indian resistance in the West 
ended at Wounded Knee. Th e Sioux faced a bleak future aft er 1890, and it was decades 
before they made some of the same adjustments as the Navajos and Comanches. 
Government Policy—The Grant Peace Plan and the Dawes Act 
Th e rapid expansion of the nation aft er the Civil War added complex new issues to the 
government’s Indian policy. Th e U.S. Army represented the U.S. government to Indians 
west of the Mississippi. Before the Civil War, the army’s goal was to limit warfare with 
and among the tribes while allowing white settlers transit across the Great Plains to 
California and Oregon. Few whites settled on the Great Plains before the 1860s, and 
the government was content to leave the Plains Indian tribes to themselves unless, like 
the Comanches, they fought directly with the army. Th e fi rst Treaty of Fort Laramie 
in 1851 did not limit Indian land use except to try to keep the peace by keeping tribes

the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868.

apart from one another. No reservations were established. Rather, in exchange for 
gift s, the army asked the tribes to avoid confl ict with one another, with military forts, 
and with the transit routes for the mail and for settlers. Asking for anything more was 
beyond the limits of what the 270 soldiers at Fort Laramie could reasonably ask in a 
meeting attended by perhaps 10,000 American Indians, including the Sioux, Arapaho, 
Cheyenne, Assinboins, Shoshones, Arikaras, Hidatsas, Mandans, and Crows. 
Aft er the Civil War, the pressure for space for white settlement greatly intensifi ed. At 
the same time, U.S. Army units that had been fi ghting the Civil War were now available for 
service in the West. Among these units were segregated African-American units that were 
sent to the West and came to be known as Buff alo Soldiers because their white commanders 
thought their hair was like that of the buff alo. Even though most military units were 
demobilized aft er the war, there were more than suffi cient numbers of soldiers—white and 
black—remaining in the army to provide a formidable fi ghting force in the West. 
In 1862, a Republican Congress had passed, and President Lincoln had signed, the 
Homestead Act , fulfi lling a major Republican campaign promise to make more federal 
land available for white settlement. Th e act provided 160 acres of federal land to 
a family that would settle and maintain the land for 5 years. Th e act, however, did not 
specify where the land would come from. Much of the initial homestead settlements 
were in Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska, and Kansas, all on lands that had been prime buffalo 
hunting locations for various tribes. Unlike before the Civil War when most whites 
had moved across the Great Plains and kept going under the protection of U.S. Army, 
aft er the Civil War, whites were coming to the plains to stay and larger army forces were 
coming with them. In addition to farming, the discovery of mineral wealth in places like 
the Black Hills of the Dakotas brought more whites and further racial confl ict. 
Immediately after the war, the same Congress that was taking control of 
Reconstruction also created its own Indian peace policy and assigned the army to implement 
it. Th e battles with the Lakota Sioux led those in Congress to seek a peaceful way 
of proceeding, so they created the Indian Peace Commission to negotiate treaties with 
the Plains tribes. Th e congressional commission developed the idea of tribal reserves 
or reservations, large tracts of land that would, they hoped, be set aside for the Indians, 
protecting the tribes from encroaching white civilization while ensuring their eventual 
assimilation into white culture. It was same policy that had been used in negotiating 
with tribes that originally lived east of the Mississippi but with one big diff erence. Th e 
majority of eastern tribes had been forced onto reservations in the West, specifi cally, 
in Oklahoma or Indian Territory. Th ere was no place further west to push the western

tribes, so the government tried to move them onto as limited an amount of land as possible. 
At the same time, of course, confi ning the tribes on reservations would ensure 
that most of the land of the West could be opened for white development. Th e plan 
was not a great success. Tribes like the Sioux, Nez Perce, and Comanches resented the 
confi nement of reservation life and oft en wandered far beyond their assigned bounds. 
When Ulysses S. Grant became president in 1869, he initiated a new Indian Peace 
Policy that became known as Grant’s Peace Policy . Grant’s thinking was shaped by 
the terrible bloodshed he had seen in the Civil War and by his identifi cation with the 
emancipation of slaves. He wanted to end the corruption that he saw in the Indian 
Bureau, and he wanted to treat the Indians with dignity. His goal was peace. At the 
same time, Grant wanted room for white settlement and was certainly not planning 
to keep whites out of the vast tracts of western land that the Indians used for hunting. 
In his fi rst annual message to Congress in December 1869, Grant said there was 
no turning back the clock, that the past “cannot be undone, and the question must be 
met as we now fi nd it.” Meeting the question, he believed, meant assimilating Indians

A new effort by President Grant to end the 
Plains Indian wars by creating a series of

Charles W. Allen, a white newspaper editor who had spent 
most of his life among the Sioux and was friendly with them, 
reported the event he saw while visiting his wife’s family at the 
Pine Ridge Reservation on December 29, 1890. The first part of this 
report is taken from Allen’s autobiography published in 1938. The 
second part is from a newspaper article he wrote for the Chadron 
Democrat three days after the events took place. 
Presently all the Indian men began coming in bunches of 
from two to a dozen or more, stringing leisurely along then taking 
their seats in a circle on the grass before the commander and 
his staff.…Then General Forsyth addressed in a firm but conciliatory 
manner.…[H]e told them that for the time being they were 
prisoners, and as such they were to give up their arms peaceably.…
He then told them to go back to their lodges, bring all 
their firearms, and turn them over to him. The Indians departed 
for their camp in a reluctant, obviously sulky mood.… 
After what seemed an unreasonable length of time the Indians 
came strolling back pretty much as they had come to the first 
meeting, except that they seemed purposely to adopt a more 
independent swagger in approaching the council field. Many of 
them were painted hideously and conspicuously grim of visage.… 
Quite a number of their wives had accompanied the braves to this 
meeting, robed in long blankets reaching almost to the ground, 
and each took a position immediately behind her husband.…The 
women who stood close behind their men concealed, under each 
blanket, a repeating rifle and well filled cartridge belt.… 
Chief Big Foot had been escorted from his tent, and urged 
his followers to maintain peace and comply with the general’s 
orders.…I also observed a Hotchkiss gun that had been placed 
in commanding position on a small knoll at the north edge of 
the camp, not far from the site on which the Catholic church now 
commemorates the tragedy.… 
Gen. Forsyth ordered a detail of dismounted troops under Capt. 
Wallace to close in and surround them at a distance of about 
twenty paces.…During this procedure, which was very interesting, 
an Indian ghost dance master, arrayed in full paraphernalia, 
began to make medicine, holding his hands up to the sun and calling 
upon the Messiah to visit his wrath upon the soldiers. He would 
take up hands full of dirt and scatter it, then hold up his hands as 
if momentarily expecting the earth to open and swallow up the 
troops. It was evident that he was getting the Indians worked up 
and he finally told them to be brave and that bullets would not hit 
them if the soldiers did shoot at them. The commander was told of 
what he was saying, and he ordered him to sit down, which order 
he finally complied with after he had walked clear around the circle 
as though he owned the earth.…They had proceeded to disarm 
but some eight or ten of these, when the brave who had been inciting 
them jumped up and said something and fired at the soldier 
who was standing guard over the arms that had been secured. The 
first gun had no sooner been fired than it was followed by hundreds 
of others and the battle was on. The fighting continued for about a 
half hour, and then was continued in skirmish for another hour.

into white society, or as the president asked, “cannot the Indian be made a useful 
and productive member of society by proper teaching and treatment.” Since most of 
the Indians did not want to become “useful and productive members” of white society, 
Grant’s policy may have been doomed from the beginning, but he tried to fi nd a 
human solution to the clash of quite diff erent cultures in the American West. 
When Grant announced his Peace Policy he said, 
Th e building of rail-roads and the access thereby given to all the agricultural and 
mineral regions of the country is rapidly bringing civilized settlements into contact 
with all the tribes of Indians.…I see no remedy for this except in placing all 
the Indians on large reservations…and giving them absolute protection there. 
Grant then appointed a member of the Seneca tribe, Ely S. Parker, as the fi rst Native 
American Commissioner of Indian Aff airs, the fi rst nonwhite to hold a high government 
position. Grant also turned to Christian missionaries, not the army or the Indian Offi ce, 
to take the lead in managing reservation aff airs. He declared the reservations off limits 
to the army, even troops who were chasing Indians with whom they had been in battle. 
Th e missionaries, people like the Quaker Lawrie Tatum who was appointed to lead the 
Comanche and Kiowa reservation, tried to make the peace policy work. But government 
supplies were slow in coming and oft en of shoddy workmanship. Many Indians resisted the 
confi nement of reservation life. Th e army was frustrated by the rule that they could not follow 
Indians into the reservation asylum even as they were expected to police the non-Indian 
territories. General Sheridan condemned the Peace Policy saying, “If a white man commits 
murder or robs, we hang him or send him to the penitentiary; if an Indian does the same, 
we have been in the habit of giving him more blankets.” Th e Indians, seeing through the 
references to peace, considered the whites as thieves who were stealing their land. 
Although the Indian Peace Policy remained in force, the army simply ignored it. 
Sherman’s defeat of the Comanches in 1874–75 was in violation of the policy that army 
units could not enter reservations, but the general was praised, not reprimanded. Within a 
year aft er Custer’s 1876 defeat, the army had subdued nearly all of the Sioux. Crazy Horse, 
one of the Sioux who was at the Little Big Horn the day Custer died, became an army scout 
and was killed at an army post in September 1877. Sitting Bull was arrested in 1881 aft er 
returning from exile in Canada. He toured briefl y with Buff alo Bill Cody’s Wild West Show 
in the 1880s and then retired to the Standing Rock reservation where, as the Ghost Dance 
movement grew, he was killed in a standoff with other Sioux sent by the army to arrest 
him. But the Grant Peace Policy had unoffi cially died long before the old chief met his end. 
Within a decade of the last major Indian wars in the 1870s and the settlement of 
most western Indians on reservations, the U.S. government again began to change 
policy. By the 1880s, reformers in and out of government were concluding that the 
assimilation of Indians into white society—a goal many shared—would not happen 
as long as they maintained their ancient ways on reservations. If the key to Indian 
survival was for them to become independent farmers who attended churches and 
schools just as whites did, then why, reformers asked, should they live on reservations? 
Why not give them all the benefi ts of the Homestead Act and allow Indians, like 
whites, to gain free title to their own 160-acre farm and American citizenship? 
In response to these arguments, Congress passed the General Allotment Act, 
known as the Dawes Act for its prime sponsor Massachusetts Senator Henry L. Dawes, 
in 1887. Th e Dawes Act divided the reservations into 160-acre tracts to be assigned to 
each family. Aft er a 25-year waiting period, Indian families could sell the land like 
their white neighbors. Indians who took possession of a homestead also became U.S. 
citizens. At fi rst glance, the Dawes Act might seem like an enlightened piece of legislation 
and at least some of its sponsors certainly believed that it was. 
Th e Dawes Act had other provisions, however, that led to negative results. Indian 
culture was tribal and communal, and hunting was a major activity; however, the 
Dawes Act pushed Indians to be farmers and to join an individualistic culture that 
many found to be quite alien. Beyond that, the most immediate impact of the act

was that, aft er each family on a reservation was allotted its 160 acres, all “surplus” 
land could then be sold by the government to white families. Later, aft er the 25-year 
waiting period, Indian families sometimes sold their land, giving them a profi t but 
alienating them from their tribe. A few tribes, the Navajos and the Senecas, were able 
to avoid implementation of the Dawes Act and retain communal ownership of their 
reservations. But for many, the act was an economic and cultural disaster. 
In 1881, 155 million acres were set aside as reservations belonging to Indian tribes. 
As a result of the Dawes Act, Indians controlled only 78 million acres by 1900. While 
the Dawes Act broke up tribal lands, other federal perspectives undercut Indian 
culture. Few white authorities believed that the First Amendment protections of 
religious freedom applied to Indian religion, especially because Indian religion and 
Indian warfare were oft en linked. It was not until 1978, that Congress declared traditional 
Indian religions to have First Amendment rights. 
Sending Indian young people to special schools was also seen by offi cials as one of the 
surest ways of implementing Grant’s promise to “favor any course towards them which 
tends to their civilization and ultimate citizenship.” In 1875, the army ordered 72 Indian 
prisoners—among them, Cheyenne, Arapahos, Kiowas, Comanches, and Caddos— 
moved from Fort Sill in Indian Territory to a new federal prison in St. Augustine, Florida. 
Lieutenant Richard Henry Pratt, a Civil War veteran who was put in charge of the prisoners, 
decided to create a model Indian school. He hired Sarah Mather from Mt. Holyoke 
College, and the two began what they believed was an essential mission to teach the 
prisoners American-style dress, the English language, and Protestant Christianity. Th e 
isolation of the prisoner-students made the process easier. Soaring Eagle, a Cheyenne 
warrior, said, “It is good to go to church….When I go home, I hope to sit down and sing 
God’s hymns.” Of course, Soaring Eagle and the other prisoners knew that about the only 
chance they had to actually go home was to comply with the school’s policies. 
Pratt and Mather’s experiment drew widespread praise. They were authorized to 
expand their eff orts and open the Carlisle Indian School in old army barracks in Carlisle, 
Pennsylvania. Twenty-five Indian boarding schools, eventually both Catholic and 
Protestant, were built on the Carlisle model between 1879 and 1902. Using federal tax 
dollars, these schools taught religion, western customs, and values to their Indian students. 
Indian students resisted the goal of the boarding schools to transform them, 
though such resistance was harshly punished. Francis La Flesche, an Omaha who 
attended a Presbyterian mission school in the 1860s, reported that he and his friends 
spoke English during the day, but at night when the missionaries were gone, they continued 
to tell each other the Omaha stories and speak the Omaha language.

THE IMPACT OF THE TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILROAD, 1869 
Analyze the building of transcontinental railroads and its impact on the nation, especially 
the West. 
When he proposed his Indian Peace Policy in December 1869, Grant said that it was needed 
because “[t]he building of rail-roads…is rapidly bringing civilized settlements into contact 
with all the tribes of Indians.” Only 7 months earlier at Promontory Point, Utah, Leland 
Stanford, governor of California and president of the Central Pacifi c Railroad, and T. C. 
Durant, vice president of the Union Pacifi c Railroad, had driven the last spike—made of 
California gold—to connect the fi rst rail line that spanned the North American continent. 
Th e dream of a transcontinental railroad gained widespread support in the 1850s. An 
army survey in 1853 off ered four possible routes across the country variously ending in

Portland, San Francisco, Los Angeles, or San Diego, each of which was considered. 
Even more serious debate focused on where the routes should begin. Illinois 
Senator Stephen A. Douglas wanted them to start in Chicago, while Mississippi 
Senator Jefferson Davis wanted them to begin in Memphis or New Orleans. It 
had been Douglas’s dream of a route starting in Chicago that originally led him 
to propose the Kansas-Nebraska Act. But before the issue of the best transcontinental 
rail route could be settled, the Civil War had intervened. Once the war 
began in 1861, the departure of Southerners from Congress meant that a more 
northerly route became the obvious choice of the remaining members. Th e Pacifi c 
Railroad Act passed easily in 1862. Th e California-based Central Pacifi c started 
building east from San Francisco and Sacramento while the Union Pacifi c started 
building west across the Great Plains from various terminals in Kansas, Nebraska, 
and Missouri, all of which were already connected to the east coast by existing rail 
lines. Th e federal government provided a 400-foot right of way, federal loans, and 
major land grants to the two railroads. Construction moved very slowly during the 
war, but the coming of peace in 1865 brought a rush to complete the work. 
Th e hard physical labor of actually laying track was done mostly by Irish workers on 
the Union Pacifi c and by Chinese laborers on the California-based Central Pacifi c. Th ose 
starting in the east were sometimes able to lay track at the rate of four rails per minute, 
covering 500 miles and reaching Cheyenne, Wyoming, by November 1867. Th ose starting 
in California had the far more diffi cult task of crossing the Sierra Nevada Mountains. 
Th ey had to build snow sheds and blast through solid rock to make their way. Finally in 
the spring of 1869, the lines connected, and the nation was knit together as never before. 
Th e fi rst rail connection across the continent was only the beginning. By the early 1890s 
four major lines reached across the country, connecting to a large network of midwestern 
and eastern rail lines. Th e major cities within California, Oregon, and Washington were 
connected by their own lines. All of the country’s large cities, and most of the mediumsized 
ones, were connected by rail. A city without a rail link was doomed to wither. 
Technological changes helped extend the railroads. George Westinghouse’s invention 
of an air brake system in 1873 made trains safer and the rides smoother as it became possible 
to stop all of the cars of a train at once rather than needing to coordinate the work of a 
brakeman on each car. Eli Janney invented a safer system for coupling and decoupling railway 
cars, saving the lives of innumerable railway workers. Safer construction of tracks and 
bridges, the replacement of iron rails with steel, and new improved locomotive production 
all improved speed and safety. Although travel to the California Gold Rush in 1849 took 
6 to 8 weeks or more, by the 1870s, a person could travel across the United States in 10 days 
and, if one could aff ord it, do so in the comfort of a Pullman sleeping car. 
Th e railroads linked communities with a speed that created a new 
sense of time. When a traveler moved by horse or wagon, the exact 
time of day did not matter that much. Trains, however, needed to follow 
a schedule if passengers and freight were to depart and arrive on 
time and collisions were to be avoided. Schedules, particularly coordinating 
trains over great distances, required something no one had 
considered before—standardized time. Although some objected, like 
the Cincinnati editor who asked why his city should shift its clocks 
“so as to harmonize with an imaginary line through Pittsburgh,” the 
clear majority of the country readily agreed to the plan. On Sunday, 
November 18, 1883, known as the “Day of Two Noons,” all but the 
most isolated American communities adjusted their clocks to place 
them in one of the four time zones into which the nation was being 
divided—time zones that still regulate daily life today. 
What had once been isolated regional economies quickly became 
part of a national commercial network because of railroads. The 
cost of moving food and other goods dropped dramatically. People 
followed the same time schedule. The railroads that crossed the

continent ended at docks where ocean-going steamships carried food, lumber, and 
other materials from the United States to Asia and South America. Within three 
decades of acquiring the West Coast, the United States was connected to a Pacific 
market of international trade and commerce that would create work for many—from 
lumberjacks in Oregon and Washington to miners in Idaho or the Dakotas to wheat 
farmers across the Midwest—creating wealth for a few and linking the nation’s economy 
to the rise and fall of world markets. Aft er 1890, a glut of wheat in Argentina 
could impact the life of a farmer in Nebraska, and a drop in the value of silver in Japan 
could hurt a miner in Idaho. Even though the United States was not quite yet a major 
world power, it was connected to the world as never before (see Map 16-2 ). 
16.2 Quick Review How did railroads improve transportation and communication in ways that 
other innovations such as canals and steamboats could not? 
THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE WEST 
Analyze how indigenous people, ranchers, farmers, miners, outlaws, politicians, and 
mythmakers shaped the West and our understanding of its history. 
The defeat of the Indian tribes and the Homestead Act, along with extraordinary 
changes in time, speed, and transportation brought on by the railroads, transformed the 
American West. Land that had been part of Mexico in the 1840s and that people from 
the East Coast only wanted to get across in the 1850s became the site of vast new ranches, 
settled farms, and rapidly expanding towns. By the 1880s and 1890s, a new region was 
becoming part of the nation’s cultural, economic, and political networks. 
Of course, not all of the new settlers in the American West got along with each 
other. Cattle ranchers depended on vast wide-open spaces to feed and move their herds. 
Farmers seeking to establish 160-acre homesteads depended on barbed wire to fence off 
their land, and keep cattle out. Older residents of what had been the northern parts of 
Mexico had relied on sometimes vague property lines and depended on communal grazing 
lands while the newly arriving Americans wanted precise lines and built fences across 
the land that had once been held in common. Settlers seeking to establish farms or build 
towns depended on law and order while others—outlaws and gunfi ghters—thought that 
the best way to make one’s fortune was to take it from others. As these groups battled for 
control, they soon came to create political organization if not always social order. 
Cowboys, Cattle, the Open Range, and Barbed Wire 
White families seeking to make their fortune, or at least a living, raising cattle moved into 
southwest Texas in the 1850s, expanding throughout the West by the 1860s and 1870s. 
Allowing the cattle to graze the vast open areas enabled herders to manage larger numbers 
than if thy had to confi ne them to pens with feed. Texas Longhorn cattle, the result of interbreeding 
cattle of Spanish origin and Anglo-American stock, seemed especially perfect for the 
region. Th ey could survive on easy-to-fi nd grass on the wide plains, did not need additional 
feed, and were resistant to Texas fever, the tick-born disease that killed other cattle. Further 
north in Kansas, Nebraska, and the Dakotas, other cattle ranchers also discovered that cattle 
thrived on the bunchgrasses of the northern prairies, which dried out by mid-summer but 
retained its protein and fed cattle well, even when they had to fi nd it through the snow. 
By the time the Civil War called most of the cattlemen off to distant battlefi elds and 
left the cattle to fend for themselves, there were probably 5 million cattle in west Texas. 
Although the Comanches took their share of the abandoned cattle, many remained by 
the end of the war, and some herds grew substantially, having been allowed to breed 
without being slaughtered for food for several years. 
In the summer of 1865, returning veterans reconnected with families and sought to 
reestablish the herds on which their families depended. Lee Moore remembered helping 
his veteran father reassemble a herd in southwest Texas, “We didn’t call it roundup

in those days. We called it cow-hunts and every man on this cow-hunt was a cattle 
owner just home from the war and went out to see what they had left and to brand up.” 
Most of those trying to reassemble herds in 1865 could not be called ranchers. Th ey 
did not own or maintain ranches, as such. Rather they allowed their cattle to graze 
freely on the open Texas, land offi cially owned by the federal government, though contested 
by various Indian tribes. Th ey identifi ed their cattle by branding them when they 
were young. Unbranded cattle—known as mavericks—were free for the taking. Th e 
few who did own ranches managed vast operations, like the huge King Ranch where 
Richard King owned 84,000 acres at the end of the Civil War, eventually expanding to 
1,270,000 acres. Th e King Ranch was one of several huge ranches in Texas and New 
Mexico, but much of the cattle raising in the 1860s and 1870s was a much more informal 
aff air that depended on respect for cattle brands rather than fenced private lands. 
Several developments account for the huge increase in cattle ranching in the decades 
aft er the Civil War. Americans started to eat a lot of beef, and in prosperous times, they

and silver mines, cattle ranches, and wheat farmers were suddenly part of a worldwide market.

could aff ord to do so. Cookbooks reported new ways to prepare beef while telling readers 
that pork, which had fed much of the nation in earlier times, was unwholesome 
and hard to digest. Hiram Latham, a publicist for the Union Pacifi c Railroad wrote a 
pamphlet, Trans-Missouri Stock Raising, in 1871 that declared the only way to support 
the nation’s manufacturing workers was to ensure they had a large supply of clothing 
and cheap food, food that needed to include a healthy amount of beef (see Map 16-3 ). 
In spite of the ease of raising cattle, particularly in Texas, Colorado, Wyoming, or 
Montana, it was a long distance from those areas to the mouths of most Americans, 
whether on the Pacific Coast or in the Midwest or on the Atlantic Coast. In 1867, 
Joseph G. McCoy founded Abilene, Kansas, one of the nation’s first cattle towns, 
to facilitate the loading of cattle onto transcontinental trains that would speed the beef 
to consumers. Jesse Chisholm began herding cattle along what came to be known as 
the Chisholm Trail from Texas, across Indian Territory, to Abilene to connect with 
those railroad lines. In 1867, some 30,000 cattle made their way along the Chisholm 
Trail, and over the next 20 years, 2 million more followed. 
Not surprisingly, Abilene and other towns at the end of the drive became wild 
places when the cattle drive reached town. Cowboys, young single men who had spent 
many months following the herds, were ready for a party when they got to town. 
Th e infamous Longbranch Saloon and the Dodge House Hotel, both in Dodge City, 
Kansas, hosted many celebrating cowboys. Th ese environments off ered some of the 
only economic opportunities for women in the cattle industry, and those opportunities 
were less than reputable. Prostitution was oft en the only way to survive and 
sometimes was a route to independence. A Wichita newspaper reported on the “ten 
bawdy houses” in Newton, Kansas, in 1871: “Here you may see young girls not over 
sixteen drinking whisky, smoking cigars, cursing and swearing.” Most prostitutes in 
the cattle towns were very young, between 14 and 23, and from the eastern United 
States, Europe, and even Indian Territory. Few stayed in the business for very long. 
As the demands for beef increased and cowboys brought more cattle into the railroad 
towns, developments in rail transport made the cattle industry more profi table. 
In 1882, Gustavus Swift created a new fl eet of refrigerated railroad cars. Beef spoiled or 
took on an odd and unappetizing look in earlier refrigerator cars when it was packed 
in ice. Swift kept the ice separate and above the beef so the beef stayed cold without 
touching ice. A few Chicago packinghouses—Swift , Armour, Morris, and Hammond— 
along with smaller ones in Kansas City, Omaha, and Forth Worth, came to dominate 
the nation’s meatpacking industry. By 1900, 82 percent of the nation’s cattle were killed 
and packed in such places. Th e Chicago’s Union Stock Yards, fi rst opened in 1865 to 
distribute cattle to these facilities, became the hub for feeding the world. 
As the beef industry became more centralized in the 1870s and 1880s, it continued 
to depend on the muscle of cowboys who cared for cattle, kept track of them when they 
drift ed away, and handled the roundups and cattle drives. Th e greatest era of the cowboys 
of the American West was between the Civil War and 1900. Th e cowboys who did the work 
of the cattle industry were mostly poor, mostly young, and of many diff erent backgrounds. 
In spite of the lonely days and only rare occasions to celebrate, cowboys themselves 
oft en did all they could to contribute to the romantic legend that surrounded them. Nat 
Love, for one, was born a slave in Tennessee in 1854. Aft er the Civil War, he moved west 
and worked as a cowboy. He was good at the work and in 1876 won roping and shooting 
contests in Deadwood, South Dakota, that gave him a prize of $200. From then on, he was 
known as Deadwood Dick and his own autobiography as well as the popular dime novels 
that told Deadwood Dick stories made him a legend, even if some of those who repeated 
his story left out the crucial fact that Deadwood Dick was an African-American cowboy. 
In the 1860s, many of the cowboys in Texas were white Confederate veterans, and 
those in Kansas or Montana were Union veterans. Still, there were a relatively large 
number of African-Americans and American Indians among them. Cattle companies, 
especially in Texas, soon began replacing the Anglo cowboys with those of Mexican 
descent whom they could pay substantially less. In 1883, white cowboys in Texas 
16.1

struck for higher wages, but the Panhandle Cattleman’s Association quickly broke the 
strike and found new sources of labor among poor single men of all races who wanted 
any job or who thought the work might be glamorous. 
As the cattle business came to be controlled by larger ranches and corporations in 
the 1880s and 1890s, cowboys became less independent and more like hired workers 
in other industries, liable to be assigned to fence building one day and cattle branding 
the next. Nevertheless, herding cattle over great distances required skill, especially 
using a rope to lasso and understanding the behavior of herds. Th e most successful 
cattle producers knew that they had to provide for their staff . Cowboys had originally 
carried their own food, but cattle owners began to supply the food from specially constructed 
wagons, accompanied by a cook, who provided the meals on the range. Th e 
fi rst rancher to carry food and bedding for the roundups and trail drives was Charles 
Goodnight, and in his honor, the wagons came to be known as “Chuck Wagons.” 
Although the cattle industry prospered, it also experienced signifi cant changes and 
downturns. Branding cattle—using a hot iron to create a scar on the left fl ank of a calf 
that was easy to identify—was key to identifying cattle who roamed over very large areas 
of range, perhaps a hundred miles or more. While branding continued, by the 1880s, 
cattle owners began using barbed wire fences to set off their ranges. Barbed wire fences 
kept herds in more contained areas and protected the best grass. Of course, protecting 
the grass meant identifying who had the rights to certain areas, which brought cattle 
ranchers into confl ict with each other and with the federal government since most of 
the western ranges were federal lands. Th e confl ict oft en turned violent, perhaps most

Success also depended on the price of beef staying high and a ready supply of cattle, 
both of which were problematic. Th e winters of 1880–81, 1884–85, and 1886–87 
were all unusually harsh. Cattle died for lack of food, or they drift ed in front of a storm 
until they piled up against a barbed wire fence and died. In addition, economic recessions 
in the 1870s and again in the late 1880s led Americans to eat less beef. By the 
mid-1880s, the market for the 20 million cattle in the American West was declining. 
Aft er a recovery, another depression in the 1890s made it hard to predict what the 
value of cattle would be in any given year. 
By the end of the 1890s, the era of open ranges, roundups, and huge cattle drives 
was coming to an end. Growing demand for high-quality beef and new knowledge 
about the best feed enabled the cattle industry to shift to smaller scale ranches where a 
rancher could maintain a few hundred cattle, ensure that they were well fed and cared 
for, and bring them to market at the best moment. 
Th e male world of the cowboys was replaced by ranch families. Men still did most of the 
work with the cattle while wives and daughters tended houses and gardens doing the “inside 
work.” But in isolated communities, rigid gender lines were hard to maintain. A woman 
who lived on a Wyoming ranch in 1899 wrote, “Th e heavy work of the ranch naturally falls 
to men, but I think most ranch women will bear me out in saying that unless the women… 
be always ready to do anything that comes along…the ranch is not a success.” Cowboys still 
worked on these ranches and urban Americans still ate beef, but the world of beef production 
and life on the plains was quite diff erent than it had been only a short time before. 
Most of a cowboy’s life was hard, lonely work.

Latino Resistance in the Southwest 
Mary A. Fulgenzi, a long-time resident of San Miguel County in New Mexico Territory, 
recalled the time in the late 1880s when tensions in her county exploded: 
In the early days of Las Vegas the wealthier people wanted to take possession of 
most of the lands. Th ey fenced in any land they fancied, whether it belonged to 
them or not. Th e poor people also needed land to graze their stock and felt that 
they should have their share, for, according to the land grant, lands not allocated 
to individuals were to be used by the community in general. 
Th roughout much of the West, the battle between those who wanted to fence and control 
the land and those who wanted free grazing land for their herds was one of the great 
divides. The emergence of cheap barbed wire changed the face of the West. The specifi 
c details about contained and open grazing were diff erent in diff erent places and for

WHAT NEW ECONOMIC 
PATTERNS EMERGED IN 
THE WEST? 
The second half of the 1800s brought quick 
expansion of the United States into the 
West. Railroads quickly spread across the 
region, spurring town development and 
creating a giant national marketplace that 
stretched from coast to coast. The federal 
government established post offi ces 
through the West to help further connect 
the nation. Settlers streamed from the East 
in search of cheap land on which to raise 
their crops and livestock. The West became 
an important agricultural region as farm 
products then moved along the railroad 
network linking western towns with eastern 
and international markets.

diff erent groups of people, but across the West there were clashes between those who 
wanted to fence off private property and those who wanted open prairies. 
At the heart of the battle in San Miguel County were two diff erent views of the 
nature of land ownership. Th e majority of Mexicanos—as people of Mexican descent 
in New Mexico preferred to be called at the time—saw themselves as las masas de 
los hombres pobres (the masses of the poor). Their assumption was that any land 
that was not specifically part of the home or the irrigated farmland of one family 
was held in common—open grazing land that all could use. By the 1880s, however, 
Anglo-Americans with very diff erent views of land ownership were arriving aft er the 
Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroad opened a line in 1879. Representatives of 
investors from the East Coast of the United States and from Britain, who could not 
imagine any alternative to private ownership of land, began buying up land and fencing 
off their property to create their own cattle ranches. 
For some longtime residents, if the fences were threatening their way of life, the remedy 
was simple: get rid of the fences. When the ranchers did not comply with requests 
to take down their fences, a secret organization called the White Caps cut the fences, 
destroyed the posts, and opened the range again. In response to widespread fence cutting, 
the territorial governor requested federal troops. In spite of federal troops, most citizens 
of San Miguel County were sympathetic with the fence cutters. By the summer of 1890, 
San Miguel County’s dissidents were running for political offi ce and soon controlled the 
balance of power between Republicans and Democrats in the territorial legislature. What 
had started as an outlaw movement had become part of the political process. 
Latino resistance took diff erent forms across the Southwest. In New Mexico, which 
retained a Mexicano majority well into the 1900s, it was possible for resistance to move 
into the political process and prevail. In Texas, where racial tensions were especially 
sharp and where the white majority grew rapidly, older Latino communities had fewer 
options. Police power rested with the Texas Rangers, who were seen by the Latino 
community as simply the force of the Anglo community. While the Rangers saw their 
opponents as outlaws, many in the Mexican-American community saw them as heroes. 
Perhaps most famous was the case of Gregorio Cortez (1875–1916) who came to Texas 
from the Mexican city of Matamoros. Cortez shot the sheriff of Manor, Texas, in 1901 
when he tried to arrest Cortez for a crime he did not commit. Aft er a long manhunt by 
the Texas Rangers, Cortez was arrested and sentenced to life in prison, but eventually 
pardoned by the governor of Texas. For generations, Latino songs and ballads—known 
as corridos —celebrated Cortez’s story within the Mexican-American community. 
Mexican-American resistance also took other forms. Carlos Velasco immigrated 
from Sonora to Tucson, Arizona, and in 1878 launched El Fronterizo , one of many 
Spanish-language newspapers in the southwest. Th e paper continued to be published 
until 1914, successfully supporting the election of Mexican-Americans to local offi ce 
and promoting Mexican customs, pride, and links across the international border. 
Farmers and Farm Towns 
As the cattle industry was transitioning to a more settled ranching industry, farmers were 
also arriving on the Great Plains in numbers never before thought possible on the arid 
grasslands. Large numbers of them were responding to massive advertising by the railroads, 
who also owned much of the western lands. New techniques of farming enabled these 
farmers to cultivate areas where only buff alo herds had roamed only a short time before. 
Th ose who began creating new homesteads and businesses as well as new lives in 
these lands of the West came from widely varying backgrounds. Th ey included people 
of diff erent faiths, Americans from eastern regions of the United States, immigrants 
from Europe and Mexico, former slaves, and Indians, among others. 
Joseph Fish, a Mormon, lived a little upstream from Salt Lake City in the village of 
Parowan, Utah, where he worked as a miller and a tanner as well as farmed, exchanged work 
with neighbors, pulled sagebrush, built fences, and harvested wheat and oats to make his living.

Gro and Ole Svendsen moved from Norway to Emmet County, Iowa, in 1863. Ole 
cut and sawed timber, broke ground, and harvested wheat. Gro made and sold butter 
and taught her children in Norwegian and English. Drops in agricultural prices and 
grasshoppers undermined their profi ts, but they carried on. For others, the challenges 
were too great. In the 1880s, a group of Ukrainian Jews created a utopian community 
in South Dakota, but the transition to the plains of South Dakota was too diffi cult and 
the community failed. Many other settlers and homesteaders also failed, and wagons 
traveling west to Kansas emblazoned with “Kansas or bust” met other returning wagons 
that said “Busted by gosh.” But people kept coming. 
Th omas Johnson, a former slave from Kentucky, joined over 300 former slaves, 
known as Exodusters, in settling Nicodemus, Kansas, a town that was attracting people 
across the post-Reconstruction South with advertisements that said, “All Colored 
People that want to GO TO KANSAS, on September 5, 1877, Can do so for $5.00.” 
Initially, there was not much to this town. The wife of the first pastor said that she 
“began to cry” when she fi rst saw it, but people stayed on, eventually building it up. 
Rosie and Henry Ise arrived at a new homestead in Osborne County, Kansas, in 
1873 with their team of horses and their small herd of cattle. Th e Ises were lucky. Th ey 
were moving to an already established homestead that had a small cabin with a bed, a 
stove, and boxes for chairs. It also had a sod chicken house and a patch of corn, wheat, 
and oats already planted. 
Mariano G. Samaniego moved north from the Mexican state of Sonora in the 1850s to 
Tucson, Arizona. He did not establish a homestead but opened a clothing store. Later, he 
earned a college degree from Saint Louis University and then expanded his business, supplying 
the Union army during the Civil War. By the 1880s, Samaniego shift ed his focus to 
cattle ranching and was known as a respected leader of the Mexican community in Arizona. 
Steven Arrow and Big Eagle took advantage of the Homestead Act and acquired their own 
homesteads in South Dakota, separate from the reservation land. Th ey were an exception to 
As Los Gorras Blancas, or the White Caps, formed a secret 
militia and cut fences in an effort to retain the traditional 
communal grazing lands in the face of new development in 
San Miguel County, New Mexico, they also announced the reasons 
for their illegal activity. In March 1890, members of the 
organization rode through the town of Las Vegas, New Mexico, 
posting Nuestra Platforma, a platform announcing their goals 
that said: 
Not wishing to be misunderstood, we hereby make this 
our declaration. 
Our purpose is to protect the rights and interests of the 
people in general; especially those of the helpless classes. 
We want the Las Vegas Grant settled to the benefit of all 
concerned, and this we hold is the entire community within 
the grant. 
We want no “land grabbers” or obstructionists of any sort 
to interfere. 
We will watch them. 
There is a wide difference between New Mexico’s “law” and 
“justice.” And justice is God’s law and that we must have at all 
hazards.…Be fair and just and we are with you, do otherwise 
and take the consequences.

the American Indian experience, but a Sioux Falls merchant said of the Sioux Homesteaders 
that they “gave more indication of civilization and industry and a show of living like white 
people than the same number of Norwegian families located a few miles below.” 
Fift een percent of homestead claims were fi led by single women. Married women could 
not fi le their own claim, being already part of a household. Elinore Pruitt Stewart wrote, 
any woman who can stand her own company, can see the beauty of the sunset, 
love growing things, and is willing to put in as much time at careful labor as 
she does over washtubs…will have independence, plenty to eat all the time 
and a home of her own in the end. 
Th e move by farm families into the West was relatively steady. Th e Homestead Act of 
1862 made 160-acre tracts available to those who settled, and Congress later allowed 
larger homesteads in the more barren lands. Th e railroads advertised for farmers to 
settle on their lands. James J. Hill arranged for the settlement of over 200,000 farmers 
on lands the Great Northern Railroad owned in Montana alone. People who had 
moved west wrote to friends and families and invited them to join them. Some farm 
families moved often in search of better prospects. Other families put down deep 
multigenerational roots, providing stability to their communities. 
Farms and homesteads dotted Minnesota, Nebraska, Kansas, and northwestern 
Iowa in the 1860s as well as California, Oregon, and Washington territory. Stage 
coach and wagon transport companies maintained links between rail centers and the 
isolated farms and towns. Th roughout the 1870s and 1880s, settlements continued to 
increase. Between 1881 and 1885, 67,000 new settlers claimed homesteads in North and 
South Dakota in the “Great Dakota Land Boom.” In 1889, homesteaders rushed in to 
Oklahoma when the federal government declared a large swath of the former Indian 
Territory to be separate from any tribal reservation and opened it to white settlement. 
As farmers and small town businesses fi lled the land, Indians felt the pressure on 
their reservations. Some sold land under the provisions of the Dawes Act, while the 
government sold off other previously tribal lands. In addition, cattle ranchers were forced 
to confi ne herds that had previously roamed freely. Long-standing Mexican communities 
in west Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California lost economic and political power 
to newcomers who had little respect for the older inhabitants of the region. Even so, the 
number of new farmers kept growing. In 1850, there were 1.5 million farms in the United 
States, just 119,000 of them west of the Mississippi River. By 1910, there were 6.4 million 
farms in the nation, and a very large number of them west of the Mississippi.

Many diff erent people fi led homestead claims, including Lizzie Chrisman and her three sisters, who established 
a claim and a sod hut in Nebraska in 1887. 

Chapter 16 Conflict in the West 501 
Successfully growing crops in these new areas required discovering which 
ones thrived best. While corn grew well in the eastern United States, the hot 
temperatures and the lack of water made it hard to grow in much of the West. 
Mennonite settlers brought Russian hard winter wheat with them, and in Kansas and 
the surrounding “Golden Belt,” this wheat became the staple crop by the 1880s. In 
other areas, spring wheat did better while, in the high plains, sorghum crops resisted 
drought well. Experimentation, luck, and watching what worked for the neighbors all 
were essential to the success of farming in areas never before farmed. 
Farming was not for the poorest people. It cost money to start a farm, even the most 
modest homestead. An 1862 farm publication estimated that the cost of starting a farm 
was $968. Homesteaders had to cover expenses in getting a family to a new place as well as 
in breaking the sod, clearing forest, building fences, buying farm implements, purchasing 
livestock and seed, and building a house. Nevertheless, there were thousands, eventually 
hundreds of thousands, of American families who saved or borrowed funds and began the 
farms that fed much of the world and settled much of the North American continent. 
Mining and Miners 
Th e Gold Rush to California was the fi rst rush of people to seek wealth in the minerals 
of the West, but it was far from the only mineral rush. As early as 1859, Henry Comstock 
found silver along the Carson River in Nevada, and thousands of California miners rushed 
east into Nevada to seek new opportunities for wealth. Comstock himself sold his claim, 
but corporate interests made fortunes in Nevada. In 1874, thousands of miners, many 
fresh from the now played-out California goldfi elds and the Nevada silver mines, made 
their way to the Black Hills of South Dakota. Th e land was part of the Sioux reservation, 
but neither the U.S. Army nor the Sioux were able to stop many of the more than 15,000 
prospectors who had come for gold. Some of them got rich, many of them died in the 
eff ort, and all of them helped launch some of the most intense of the Plains Indian Wars. 
Mining and the quest for mineral wealth continued to lead to fortunes and to death in 
the West. In 1882, a poor Irish immigrant, Marcus Daly, persuaded California investors to 
back his claim to a silver mine near Butte, Montana. Very little silver was ever found at the 
Anaconda mine, but it turned out to be one of the richest deposits of copper in the world, 
making millions for Daley, his backers, and the Anaconda Copper Company. Others found 
mining wealth in gold, silver, copper, and lead mines in Idaho, Montana, Colorado, and as 
far away as Arizona and Alaska. Th e mineral wealth of the West seemed endless, and many 
from around the world sought to fi nd it, though only a very few gained any real wealth. 
Seemingly overnight, new towns emerged wherever there was mining for copper, silver, 
and gold, including Carson City, Nevada; Deadwood, South Dakota; and Anaconda, 
Montana. Like the cattle towns, these overwhelmingly male mining towns made up of 
transients could be violent places where the smallest disagreement could erupt into 
violence. In addition, ethnic rivalries oft en divided the miners. As in California’s gold 
fi elds, Chinese miners were soon driven out of most mining operations, in spite of the 
fact that Chinese immigrants were 10 percent of Montana’s population and 25 percent 
of Idaho’s in the 1870s. When not driven out, the Chinese were forced to take low-level 
jobs working water cannons or doing laundry for other miners. Miners of European 
origin also drove Mexican-American miners out of the fi elds. 
Mining was male work and typically did not lead to a settled life. In 1860, the mining 
camps of Virginia City and Gold Hill, Nevada, reported a population of 2,300 
men and 30 women. Th e towns also refl ected the transient nature of the population. 
In 1879 Leadville, Colorado, had four banks, four churches, and 120 saloons, plus a 
fair share of brothels. While some mining towns later became important commercial 
centers, many soon became empty ghost towns once the mining played out. 
Most prospectors sought wealth from their individual discoveries, but most of 
the money in mining was made by large corporations like the Anaconda Copper 
Company that could aff ord expensive mining equipment to extract deeply buried ore. 
Work in the mines dangerous. Jobs were oft en divided by ethnicity, with Chinese and

Latino miners given the least-skilled and lowest paying jobs and miners from Europe 
getting the better paying positions. Nevertheless, with little attention to safety, all of 
the miners faced explosions, fl oods, cave-ins, and asphyxiation from poisonous gasses. 
Only the emergence of new unions among the miners began to address the dangers, if 
not the ethnic divides, in the 1890s (see Chapter 18 ) . 
Outlaws, Gunfi ghters, and Mythmakers—Legends of the Old West 
Th e West of the late 1800s could be a very violent place. Contrary to Hollywood images, 
cowboys and Indians tended to keep their distance from each other. It was the army that 
fought the Indian wars, not the cowboys. But there was plenty of violence among whites. 
Ranch owners and land developers hired professional gunfi ghters to eliminate people they 
saw as troublemakers. Angry people on the margins, or those pushed to the margins of society, 
struck back violently, cutting fences in New Mexico or becoming outlaws and counting 
on the vast distances and easy anonymity of the West to protect them. Cowboys in town at 
the end of a long and dull cattle ride shot each other. Much of the violence was local and personal, 
some was between people wanting very diff erent development in the region, especially 
between cattle ranchers and farmers, and some was also a carryover from the Civil War. 
In Tombstone, Arizona, the local elite hired Wyatt Earp and his brothers, Virgil, 
Morgan, and Warren, along with Doc Holliday to make the town safe enough to encourage 
investors from California and the East Coast. Th e local elite and the Earp brothers all 
had strong Union Army and Republican Party connections. Th ey were bothered by an 
outlaw group, ex-Confederate cattle rustlers led by the Clanton brothers and McLaury 
families. On October 26, 1881, at the O.K. Corral, the two sides met. Both Clanton brothers 
and one of the McLaurys were killed, and Tombstone became a more respectable place. 
Another crime wave took place in Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas. 
During the Civil War, Confederate raiders led by William Quantrill and including 
Jesse and Frank James terrorized Union supporters in Missouri and Kansas (see 
Chapter 15 ) . Quantrill was killed before the war ended, but the James brothers continued 
a long reign as postwar outlaws, starting with a bank robbery at Liberty, Missouri, 
on February 13, 1866, and continuing in the new and lucrative arena of train robberies 
well into the 1880s. Many robbers like the James brothers found widespread, 
though quiet, support by farm families who would never attempt illegal behavior but 
who hated the railroads and the large commercial ranchers. Th ese families privately 
cheered when those more powerful forces suff ered losses at the hands of these outlaws, 
however violent and self-serving the particular rebels might be. 
In New Mexico, the so-called Lincoln County War of 1878 pitted two groups of 
ranchers seeking to dominate the county. Both hired outlaws, one of whom was a 
young teenager named Henry McCarty who changed his name to William Bonney 
(a famous pirate) and who came to be known as “the Kid.” Aft er the Lincoln County 
War ended, the hired outlaws drift ed away. Aft er trying unsuccessfully to fi nd honest 
work, and aft er being promised a pardon but then having it revoked by New Mexico’s 
governor, “the Kid” turned to cattle rustling and robbery until he was shot by Lincoln 
County Sheriff Pat Garrett. But Billy the Kid, who was 21 when he died, had killed 10 
people in his short and violent life. His legend grew far beyond his life as a whole publishing 
industry came to thrive on the retelling and expansion of his legend. 
Stories of gunfighters like Billy the Kid and Wyatt Earp became legends of the 
American West, but the person who did the most to create the legend of the Wild West 
was a former army scout named William Cody who created his highly successful Buff alo 
Bill’s Wild West Show in the 1880s. According to his autobiography, Cody was born in 
Iowa in 1846, but his family soon moved to Kansas where his father was killed by the 
“border ruffi ans” from Missouri in the battles of “Bleeding Kansas.” Cody took a job 
herding cattle to support his family when he was 11 years old. During the Civil War, he 
was part of a local militia that protected the territory from attacks by Quantrill and the 
James brothers. Later, he hunted buff alo and served as a scout. On one occasion, Cody 
scouted for a party that included James Gorden Bennett of the New York Herald, one of 
16.2 
16.3 
16.1 

Chapter 16 Conflict in the West 503 
the nation’s great publicists. Bennett fi ctionalized Cody as the hero of one of the popular 
dime novels of the time, Buff alo Bill: the King of the Border Men, which gave Cody the 
chance to launch his “Wild West, Rocky Mountain, and Prairie Exhibition.” 
Buff alo Bill’s Wild West Show was everything eastern crowds wanted it to be. It 
included scenes from Indian battles, Indian dancing, stagecoach robberies, and always 
the shooting prowess of Annie Oakley, who epitomized the “good” frontier woman of 
wholesome character who could outshoot any man. In the 1880s, Sitting Bull himself 
traveled with the show, giving it an “authentic” aura for many who were anxious to 
see the leader who had defeated Custer in 1876. 
The Wild West show was a long way from any true representation of the West. 
Although the Indians performed amazing feats of horseback riding, they nearly always 
ended up fulfi lling stereotypical images in the minds of their white audiences. Similarly, 
while the true cowboys were an ethnically diverse lot—white, Mexican, Indian, and 
African-American—all of Cody’s cowboys were white. Th e U.S. Army units in the show 
were also white, in spite of the active role of African-American Buff alo soldiers in the 
West. Annie Oakley, who was an amazing shot with a rifl e, lived in Ohio and never traveled 
further west except on tour with the show. Indians almost never had the battles with 
the cowboys that Cody portrayed; Indians fought with the army, and cowboys avoided 
those battles. However, Indians facing desperate poverty on the reservations found work 
in the shows that brought needed income, and they were allowed to dance traditional 
dances in the shows that were banned by federal authorities on the reservations. 
Cody’s shows were performed all across the United States and in Europe, twice 
before Queen Victoria, and one of his riders performed in Outer Mongolia. Prince 
Albert I of Monaco came to Cody, Wyoming, to hunt with Buff alo Bill. When the show 
declined in popularity, Cody reinvented himself once again as an advisor to the new 
Hollywood studios—as did Wyatt Earp—on “realistic” ways to portray the old West in 
the new medium that was sweeping the nation. In the process, an image of the Wild 
West was formed that still persists. 
Becoming States 
For much of the 1880s, much of the western United States was organized into territories 
that were directly controlled by the federal government rather than as states 
that sent senators and representatives to Congress and voted in presidential elections.

California was admitted in 1850, just aft er the war with Mexico and the discovery of 
gold. Minnesota was admitted in 1858 and Oregon in 1859. Kansas became a state in 
1861, Nevada in 1864, Nebraska in 1867, and Colorado in 1876. More than a decade 
later, in 1889 and 1890, six new western states were all admitted almost at once—the 
former territories of North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Washington, Idaho, 
and Wyoming. Utah was admitted in 1896, Oklahoma in 1907, and New Mexico and 
Arizona in 1912. Several unique issues account for the time lags. 
In some cases, local elites found that they could prosper by controlling the federal 
appointments and federal funds in their territory while bypassing the democratic processes 
that statehood brought. Many in Congress also liked, and profi ted from, these 
arrangements. Th e federal government owned much of the land in western states, and 
until the Indian wars came to an end, the U.S. Army was the chief protector of western 
citizens. Th e U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers mapped 
and shaped the land of the West. Th rough the territorial stages and beyond, the federal 
government was a more important part of life in the West than in the East. 
Some of the states posed unique issues. Long before it was admitted as a state, the territorial 
legislature in Wyoming granted the 1,200 women living in the territory the right to 
vote. When Wyoming became a state in 1890, it also became the fi rst state to grant women 
the right to vote, allowing women in Wyoming to vote for president while their sisters elsewhere 
could not. Th ree years later, the State of Colorado granted women the right to vote. 
Aft er that, campaigns for women’s votes stalled. A commitment to women’s rights was not 
universal in the West, but it was more popular there than elsewhere (see Map 16-4 ). 
A more complicated issue arose in Utah and delayed statehood for years. Th e area 
around the Great Salt Lake had been settled by Mormon families in 1846 and 1847 when it 
was still part of Mexico (see Chapter 10 ). Aft er the region became part of the United States 
in 1848, the federal government initially left the Mormons on their own, and Brigham 
Young served as territorial governor as well as spiritual leader. However, in the late 1850s, 
President Buchanan forced Young out of offi ce and appointed a non-Mormon governor. 
The issue for Buchanan was the Mormon commitment to plural marriage. 
Mormon men—but not Mormon women—were encouraged to take more than one 
spouse. Th e majority of Mormon men had only one wife, but a signifi cant number 
had two, and Brigham Young himself had 27 wives and 56 children. As with more 
traditional families, some extended Mormon families succeeded quite well while others 
were torn. When questioned, the majority of Mormon women, including women 
whose husbands had other wives, defended their arrangement. 
Plural marriage horrified most people in the rest of the United States, however. 
While Presidents Lincoln and Johnson had been too preoccupied with war 
and Reconstruction to worry much about the Mormons, Presidents Grant, Hayes, 
Garfi eld, and Arthur all promised to deal with the “Mormon Question.” As early as 
1862, Congress passed the Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act, making it a federal crime to take 
multiple wives, but Utah was far away and Mormon juries were not about to convict 
anyone accused of that crime. 
In spite of all of the controversy and hostility generated by the issue of plural marriage, 
the Mormon community prospered. By the 1860s, there were enough people 
living in Utah Territory to qualify for statehood. By 1870, the population stood at 87,000. 
Unlike other parts of the West, where white men far outnumbered white women, Utah 
had a balanced gender ratio. Women and men prospered in a community of strict 
morality and hard work, including work for women outside of the household. Women 
ran their own industries, cooperative stores, as well as relief societies and charities. 
Th e rest of the United States remained dissatisfi ed with Utah’s practices, however, 
and eventually, the Mormon leadership decided that statehood was more important 
than maintaining plural marriage. In 1890, the Mormon Church announced the end 
of plural marriage, and although there were those who continued to practice it, the 
majority of members went along with the decision. With that key issue resolved, Utah 
16.2

Chapter 16 Conflict in the West 505 
was admitted as a state in 1896. One of the fi rst moves by the new state legislature was 
to, again, give women the right to vote and hold offi ce, making Utah the third state, 
aft er Wyoming and Colorado, to do so. 
Issues of race delayed the admission of the last three western states. Oklahoma had 
been established as Indian Territory when Andrew Jackson’s Indian removal policies 
forced some northern tribes and the fi ve southeastern tribes to move there. By the late 
1800s, the tribes had put down roots, developed new communities, and were thriving. 
Other western tribes had also been forced to settle in Indian Territory. Nevertheless, the 
Dawes Act and other federal policies opened much of the western part of the territory to 
white settlement. In 1905, representatives of the tribes proposed establishing two separate 
states—Sequoyah in the eastern portion would be made up of the Indian Reservations. 
Oklahoma in the west would be made up of the white areas. Indiana Senator Albert J. 
Beveridge, Chair of the Senate Committee on Territories wanted to have just one territory 
dominated by “Americans,” by which he did not mean Indians, and President Th eodore 
Roosevelt agreed. Oklahoma was admitted in 1907 as a single state. 
Th e Territory of New Mexico initially included all of Arizona and New Mexico. Th e 
population quickly reached the level required for statehood but, unlike the other areas 
acquired from Mexico, especially Texas and California, the majority of the people living

in New Mexico Territory were of Mexican descent. In spite of the fact that they were now 
U.S. citizens, Congress was not prepared to admit a self-governing state with a Mexican- 
American majority. In 1902, Senator Beveridge proposed uniting them again and admitting 
them as a single state since that would ensure a larger “American” (or non-Mexican) 
population, but that proposal failed. President William Howard Taft signed legislation in 
1912 admitting New Mexico and Arizona as the 47th and 48th states of the Union. 
Well before New Mexico and Arizona became states, the political, economic, and 
cultural shape of the vast region known as the West was settled. Th e original inhabitants 
who had fought with each other and with whites and had hunted buff alo across 
the plains or lived comfortably on the rich resources of the Pacifi c Coast were moved 
to distant reservations where they were alternatively ignored and challenged by federal 
authorities while building new cultures for themselves and the surrounding communities. 
By 1900, much of the West was divided into settled communities of farms, large 
and small, and growing towns connected by railroads. Th ere was still plenty of desolate 
empty country to be found, but the West of the 1800s was a receding memory. 
16.3 
Quick Review What were the major concerns involved in admitting new states in the 
West? How were these issues similar to or different from those involved in admitting states 
in the East? 
CONCLUSION 
Th e American West changed dramatically between 1865 and 1890. In the midst of the 
Civil War, Abraham Lincoln had urged tribal leaders to adopt the “peaceful ways of the 
white people,” without noticing the irony of such a plea in the midst of the Civil War. 
Th e end of the Civil War brought two of the most violent decades in the West as units of 
the U.S. Army fought with various tribes trying to force the Native Americans to give up 
their traditional hunting and nomadic ways to settle on reservations. By the 1890s, confl 
ict between whites and Indian tribes was over as tribes were defeated and moved into 
ever-shrinking reservations. While the impacts of white settlement and the Civil War on 
American Indians varied from tribe to tribe, in the long run, they were a disaster. 
Aft er the Civil War, white ranchers, farmers, and miners built new settlements across 
the West. What began as great cattle ranches were replaced by smaller farms producing beef 
and wheat for national and world markets. Th e agricultural developments of the post–Civil 
War era depended on new technologies—most importantly, railroads that brought supplies 
to isolated farmers and shipped their products to world markets. What had once been isolated 
regional economies quickly became part of a national and international commercial 
network because of railroads, and the United States was connected to the world as never 
before. As more and more people settled the West, access to vast regions for grazing cattle 
became limited and tensions began to mount. Still, the West was largely rural, and disputes 
were oft en settled by hiring outlaws rather than by more traditional means. Farmers came 
to the West for many reasons, including the desire for land, the search for better economic 
opportunities than were available in the East, and a longing for adventure. Although most 
farmers established homesteads in hopes of establishing permanent roots, mining towns 
sprang up around impermanent mines, and they were oft en violent places. 
Once a distant frontier, by 1890, the American West was becoming part of 
the nation’s cultural, economic, and political networks and by 1912 the last of the 
western territories had become a state. Th e large areas that had been governed as territories 
were not settled and populated enough to be considered as states, but some of these 
areas posed unique issues. However, despite debates over economic issues, voting rights 
of women, concern about the plural marriage of Mormon communities, and the racial 
diversity of parts of the Southwest, all of the once isolated territory of the American 
West had been divided into new states that were admitted to the Union by 1912.

Chapter 16 Summary and Review 
THE TRIBES OF THE WEST AND THE U.S. GOVERNMENT 
16.1 
Explain western development from an Indian perspective and 
the way Indian and white cultures shaped each other. 
Summary 
Th e impact of the Civil War on American Indians varied from 
tribe to tribe. For the Comanches, arguably the most powerful 
tribe on the western frontier in 1860, the Civil War was a 
great gift. The diversion of troops to distant battlefields gave 
the Comanches the opportunity to move back into parts of 
Texas they had been forced out of in earlier decades. For a time, 
the Comanches became major players in the regional trade in 
cattle, weapons, and human beings. By the mid-1870s, however, 
the Comanches had been forced onto reservations, defeated 
by a sustained military eff ort and the depletion of the buff alo 
herds. During the Civil War, the Apaches and the Navajos faced 
a relentless assault by U.S. forces. Over time, the Navajos were 
able to negotiate a reservation system with the U.S. government 
that allowed them to keep their way of life alive. An infl ux of 
settlers and miners from the 1850s onward put northwest tribes 
like the Modocs and Nez Perce under ever-increasing pressure. 
Eff orts to resist white encroachment were met with violence, 
and by the end of the 1870s, both the Modocs and Nez Perce 
had been decimated. Years of fi ghting between the Lakota Sioux 
and the U.S. Army led to the Treaty of Fort Laramie of 1868. 
Th e United States, however, failed to live up to the treaty, and in 
1876, a new round of warfare began. Once defeated, the Sioux 
were forced onto reservations. Rapid expansion aft er the Civil 
War complicated governmental Indian policy. Th e 1887 Dawes 
Act replaced the reservation system with the allotment of land 
to individual families. In the long run, it proved to be a disaster 
for Indian peoples.

THE IMPACT OF THE TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILROAD, 1869 
16.2 
Analyze the building of transcontinental railroads and its 
impact on the nation, especially the West. 
Summary 
The dream of a transcontinental railroad gained widespread 
support in the 1850s. A variety of routes were explored, but 
the coming of the Civil War ensured that a northerly one was 
chosen. The first transcontinental railroad was completed in 
1869, and by the early 1890s, there were four major lines across 
the country connecting to a large network of midwestern and 
eastern rail lines. Railroads became the essential economic link 
between American cities. Technological changes helped extend 
the railroads and the railroads then hastened further technological 
change. Th e railroads made a crucial contribution to the 
emergence of a national economy, connecting regional economies 
and facilitating American overseas commerce by moving 
American products quickly and effi ciently to American ports.

end of the 1800s, the region was becoming part of the nation’s

On May 10, 1876, Ulysses S. Grant, then in his 8th year as 
president, traveled to Philadelphia to open the Centennial 
International Exhibition of Industry. Th e event celebrated the 
100th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence 
with a massive show of the nation’s progress in science, technology, 
and industry. Th e exhibition covered 285 acres on the banks of 
Philadelphia’s Schuylkill River and included pavilions from each state 
and from many foreign countries. Among them, Colorado and Kansas 
displayed corn 20 feet high, and Germany displayed a giant artillery 
piece from the Krupp works. Between the pavilions were refreshment 
stands selling popcorn, waffl es, soda water, root beer, and German 
lager bier as well as a fountain built by the Sons of Temperance, which 
was serving ice water. Th e focus was on the great mechanical achievements 
of the United States, symbolized by the giant Corliss steam 
engine that provided power for all the exhibits in Machinery Hall and 
that seemed to be without vibration or noise (because its boiler was 
outside the building) as well as by the many mowers, reapers, sewing 
machines, typewriters, fans for ventilating mines, and the Pullman 
sleeping cars. Most of all, the fair told the world that the United States 
had arrived as a manufacturing and technological giant.

an appreciative audience that included the Emperor of Brazil. It was a fi tting opening 
to an era in which business, manufacturing, and technology would dominate the 
nation’s political, economic, and cultural life, bringing prosperity and power that 
was previously unimagined. It would also bring clashes between those who benefi ted 
and those who did not, which frightened many and nearly tore the nation apart. 
Th is chapter explores how the nation came to be that giant, at what cost to its people 
and the world, and with what results in the culture—or, rather, the many diff erent 
cultures—of the country. 
TECHNOLOGY CHANGES THE NATION 
Explain the inventions of the late 1800s and their impact. 
Alexander Graham Bell saw himself as a teacher more than an inventor. While teaching 
deaf students at Boston University, Bell sought new ways to help deaf people hear. In July 
1874, he discovered that if a person were to speak into a vibrating set of reeds, it created 
a fl uctuating current that could, at the other end of an electronic wire, be turned back 
into the same sound through another set of tuned reeds. He patented his new invention 
in March 1876 and demonstrated it fi rst by calling his assistant Th omas Watson from 
the next room. Later, he showed it at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and then 
at the World’s Fair. While Bell returned to teaching, others organized the Bell Telephone 
Company. By 1880, there were 30,000 telephone subscribers. By 1900, the number had 
grown to 1.3 million, and by 1920, to 13 million. In four decades, Bell’s experiment 
had become a necessity of modern life. For most Americans, the telephone replaced 
the telegraph, developed by Samuel F. B. Morse from earlier inventions in 1835. By the 
1840s, telegraphs were relaying messages and news in Morse code, consisting of dot 
and dash signals, over miles of telegraph wires—215,000 miles of wires by 1900. But the 
telephone quickly made the telegraph outdated. 
Before Bell gained fame for his telephone, Th omas Edison was already on his way 
to being known as the greatest inventor of the era. Edison was born in Milan, Ohio, 
in 1847, the same year as Bell. At 16, with little formal schooling, he became a telegraph 
transmitter. Several people in the telegraph industry were trying to design what 
they called a “diplex,” a way to send two messages—one in each direction—on the 
same telegraph wire at the same time. In 1873, Edison produced both a diplex and a 
quadruplex that could send two messages simultaneously each way on a single wire, 
greatly increasing the value of every telegraph line in the nation and securing Edison’s 
fame and fortune. While he was toying with that invention, Edison had also invented 
the Edison Universal Stock Printer in 1871, a greatly improved version of the stock 
ticker tape machine. 
In 1876, Edison established an independent research laboratory at Menlo Park, 
New Jersey. Th e many employees there were made to understand that they worked 
only at Edison’s direction and he got all of the credit. Eventually, he had 1,000 patents 
to his name, thus becoming the most productive American inventor of all time. He 
tinkered with ways to record a human voice and music. On April 18, 1878, he demonstrated 
his new phonograph at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington, DC, 
and, later that night, at a midnight show at the White House. 
Edison’s most important invention was the electric light bulb. In the 1870s, large 
meeting halls were lit by arc lamps, and gas lights were popular in many places. Th e 
rest of the nation—city as well as country—depended on kerosene lamps or candles 
when the sun went down. The electric light bulb changed things across the country. 
Given Edison’s fame, he was able to assemble a consortium of fi nanciers, led by 
J. Pierpont Morgan, to support his research. Aft er toying with diff erent options, the 
Edison labs created a bulb that lit a room for 16 hours on November 17, 1879. Almost 
immediately, everyone wanted electric lights, and Edison wanted everyone to have

them. He made London, Paris, and New York the priority cities because he knew that 
what happened in those places would quickly be reported elsewhere. Within 2 years, 
all three cities had buildings lit by electric lights. On September 4, 1882, Edison pulled 
the switch that lit a number of buildings in southern Manhattan, including the House 
of Morgan, the New York Stock Exchange, and the headquarters of the New York 
Times and New York Herald . 
Th e inventions just kept coming. George Westinghouse and Nikola Tesla found 
that alternating current was a much more effi cient way to transmit electricity than 
the direct current that Edison used. Edison was initially skeptical, but by the 1890s, 
alternating current produced at generating plants from New York to California was 
powering much of the nation. Frank J. Sprague introduced the fi rst electric streetcars 
in Richmond, Virginia, in 1888, and these cars, which were cheaper and cleaner and 
safer than horse-drawn or steam cars, caught on quickly. 
In 1892, the General Edison Electric Company merged with a rival to create 
General Electric, the company that not only produced light bulbs but also all things 
electric. By 1896, using fi lm developed by George Eastman of Rochester, New York, 
Edison moved from small-scale to large-screen moving pictures, and in 1902, the 
Victor Talking Machine Company began mass-producing recording disks and 
players. Th e country was radically diff erent because of Edison’s work and that of other 
prolifi c inventors who gave the country elevators invented by Elisha G. Otis, machine 
tools from Pratt and Whitney, steam boilers from Babcock and Wilcox, newspaper 
linotype compositors, and typewriters. A total of 440,000 patents issued between 1860 
and 1890 transformed modern life. 
In the 1890s, a number of independent manufacturers began experimenting with 
gasoline-powered vehicles, putting a gasoline engine on bicycles or carriages, which 
led to automobiles. Although by 1899 only 2,500 automobiles were produced per year, 
many were predicting that the new vehicles would replace horse-drawn carriages. 
Th ey were right. By 1916, 1 million automobiles were produced in the United States, 
which created massive change as work with horses declined and a new set of jobs in 
the automobile industry began and as more and more Americans experienced the 
freedom that an automobile gave them. 
Th e key to the vastly expanded production of automobiles was the vehicle itself, 
which was relatively simple, given other inventions that existed. Rather, expanded 
production was possible only aft er inventing a way to produce large numbers of cars 
at low cost. Th e genius who revolutionized the production of automobiles was Henry 
Ford. Ford, a former machinist, built his fi rst automobile in 1896 aft er many others 
had done so, but it was his invention of the assembly line that made possible the 
mass-production of cars at reasonable costs. Ford took the idea of interchangeable 
parts, fi rst developed for guns by Eli Whitney, and applied it to cars. Th en he created 
a process whereby those parts could be assembled in a routinized fashion that 
greatly speeded production, thus lowering cost, even if it made the role of most workers 
extremely boring. 
Ford opened a plant for the production of the Model T Ford in Highland Park, 
Michigan, in 1910 and added a moving assembly line in 1913. Each worker was 
assigned one small task to be repeated over and over. As Ford described it, “Every 
piece of work in the shop moves. Th ere is no lift ing or trucking of anything other 
than materials.” Worker aft er worker did his assigned task over and over again. At the 
end of the process, a fully assembled Model T emerged from the assembly line. Ford 
paid his workers well. He had to. Th ey found the work mind numbing, but valued the 
pay—high enough that they, too, could aff ord their own Model T. He transformed an 
industry, bringing the cost of an automobile to within the reach of many Americans 
and spawning a whole set of new industries from highway construction to automobile 
repairs. Th e success of the automobile dramatically expanded the nation’s need 
for oil, now refi ned into gasoline to power the rapidly growing numbers of vehicles 
(see Table 17-1 ).

While Ford, Walter Chrysler, and the founders of General Motors were creating 
the automobile industry in Detroit, Michigan, other inventors were tinkering with 
additional ways to advance transportation. Wilbur and Orville Wright, two bicycle 
makers from Dayton, Ohio, were determined to develop a flying machine. On 
December 17, 1903, on a deserted beach at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, their machine 
took off . By 1908, Orville Wright had a contract with the Army Signal Corps to conduct 
test fl ights at Fort Myer, Virginia. Th e Wright brothers conducted test fl ights 
around the country, including Los Angeles and Chicago. Air travel did not transform 
the lives of most Americans as quickly as the automobile because it remained ineffi 
cient and dangerous for some time. Nevertheless, watching people actually leave the 
ground on machines confi rmed for many that, in the realm of technology, anything 
was possible.

CORPORATIONS AND MONOPOLIES 
Analyze the role of the new giant corporations in American life. 
Th e kinds of inventions that were appearing in the 1880s and 1890s, like the earlier 
railroads and telegraph systems, could not be produced by a family business. Railroads 
crossed the continent. Electric generation required huge investments. Telephones were 
useful primarily if they connected large numbers of people. Most of the country’s earliest 
corporations had been for public benefi t—building universities and hospitals—or 
for temporary partnerships for specifi c ventures. New corporate structures emerged 
during the Jacksonian era in response to larger, more expensive ventures to process 
cotton and manufacture other materials. Aft er the Civil War, those corporate structures 
achieved a level of size and power undreamed of by earlier generations of manufacturers. 
Managing the investments involved in the great new industries also required 
a new kind of fi nancing. In the absence of a federal bank—nothing had replaced the 
Bank of the United States that Jackson had abolished in the 1830s (see Chapter 10 ) — 
private bankers played an increasingly important role. Post–Civil War corporations 
and banks were of a size and a level of power the nation had not seen before. Th ey 
made a few Americans extremely wealthy—richer than any American ever had been 
before—and they made other Americans very nervous about the new concentrations 
of wealth and the accompanying power. Th e outsized wealth of the era, sometimes 
lavishly spent, inspired the humorist Mark Twain to name this post–Civil War era the 
“ Gilded Age ,” a reference to coating items with gold. For some, the Gilded Age produced 
an excess of money, taste, and power; for others, it created poverty.

Chapter 17 The Gilded Age Building a Technological and Industrial Giant and a New Social Order 513 
Financing and Controlling the Railroads—Jay Cooke, Cornelius 
Vanderbilt, and Others 
At the end of the Civil War, the most powerful banker in the United States was Jay 
Cooke, who saved the Union’s fi nances during the war (see Chapter 14 ) . In the early 
1870s, however, he almost wrecked the nation’s economy. 
Cooke fi nanced the Northern Pacifi c Railroad (see Chapter 16 ) , telling European 
investors that a rail line from Duluth, Minnesota, to the Pacifi c coast would connect the 
world’s breadbasket to shipping across the Pacifi c and across the Atlantic. He insisted, 
“Th ere is nothing on the American continent equal to it.…Th ere is no end to the possibilities 
of wealth here.” Th e promise of wealth was enticing, and investment poured in. 
However, there were too many railroads, and few were making profi ts. At the same time, 
the end of the seemingly faraway Franco-Prussian War (1870–1871) caused world grain 
prices to drop precipitously as European countries produced more of their own wheat. 
Th e result was further reduced profi t on the rail lines that hauled American wheat. A 
government investigation into the Union Pacifi c Railroad’s shaky fi nances during this 
period undermined public confi dence in rail investments. As a result, Cooke could neither 
sell new railroad bonds nor meet obligations on the old ones. On September 18, 
1873, Jay Cooke and Company declared bankruptcy and closed its doors. 
Th e news that the nation’s most prestigious banker could not meet his obligations 
undermined fi nancial confi dence, launching what was known as the Panic of 1873 . Th e 
Nation magazine described Wall Street: “Great crowds of men rushed to and fro trying 
to get rid of their property, almost begging people to take it from them at any price.” Th e 
Stock Exchange closed for 10 days. Banks collapsed. Railroad construction stopped. By 
1874, 500,000 people had lost their jobs, and breadlines were seen not only in New York 
but also wherever railroad construction and the demand for steel rails, wooden ties, or 
products that moved by rail had been boosting the economy. Th e depression of 1873 
demonstrated the boom-and-bust cycle of the new economy and the degree to which 
railroads and banking connected all parts of the nation’s fi nancial structure. 
As the economy recovered aft er 1873, the man who profi ted more than any other 
was already very rich Cornelius Vanderbilt. Aft er Robert Fulton invented the steamboat 
in 1807, Vanderbilt created a steamboat empire, fi rst in New York Harbor, and 
then around the world. Aft er 1815, Vanderbilt’s steamers began to travel to Boston, 
New Orleans, and—during the California gold rush—to Nicaragua to meet other 
steamers that took gold seekers up the coast to California. Controlling the transit to 
California was far more profi table than seeking gold there. His style of doing business 
was illustrated on one occasion when, in an argument with competitors he said, 
“Gentlemen: You have undertaken to cheat me. I won’t sue you, for the law takes 
too long. I will ruin you.” During the Civil War, Vanderbilt kept his ships moving 
between New York and Union-held New Orleans and beyond to South America in 
spite of Confederate eff orts to stop them. 
Aft er the Civil War, Vanderbilt shift ed from steamships to railroads. Vanderbilt 
did not build railroads; he bought them. In addition, he created new and much 
more profi table ways to manage them. Vanderbilt created corporations of a size not 
previously known in the United States and launched a managerial revolution. Th e 
corporations that Vanderbilt led involved levels of managers reporting to powerful 
central offi ces. Th e new bureaucracies could ensure safety: trains that ran on schedule 
were less likely to collide, and trains that ran on well-laid tracks were less likely to 
derail. Th ey also created great new wealth even as they reduced the role of any one 
individual manager or boss. Vanderbilt was hardly alone in fostering either of these 
developments, but he was certainly an innovative leader. 
In 1863, Vanderbilt bought a major interest in the New York & Harlem Railroad, a 
small line that ran to the heart of Manhattan. Vanderbilt improved its tracks, cars, and 
service and purchased the connecting Hudson River Railroad. Th en in 1867, he forced

the directors of the state’s largest railroad, the New York Central, to sell to him or be 
shut out of New York City. His New York Central Railroad empire made Cornelius 
Vanderbilt the richest man in America when he died in 1877. 
Others also became major speculators in the United States in the 1860s and 1870s. 
Daniel Drew, along with Jay Gould and Jim Fisk, came to be known as corporate 
pirates. Th ey simply extracted wealth from a company. As a young man, Drew herded 
cattle from farms to slaughterhouses. He once claimed to have perfected a technique 
of feeding salt to his cattle and then, just before reaching the slaughterhouses, giving 
them all the water they wanted so they would arrive looking plump and, thus, fetch 
a good price. In later life, he certainly did the same thing with stocks: buying companies, 
issuing stock far beyond the company’s value—called watering the stock in 
honor of his experience with cattle—and then leaving the company almost bankrupt 
while he walked away with the profi t from the stock sales. 
Later, in 1869 Drew, Gould, and Fisk teamed up to corner the nation’s gold supply 
(see Chapter 15 ) . First, they convinced President Grant to appoint Daniel Butterfi eld to 
the key treasury post overseeing the nation’s gold supply. Th ey then bribed Butterfi eld 
to join in their conspiracy. As they kept buying and hoarding gold, the price kept 
going up and up because of the demand they were creating. Grant discovered, or at 
least guessed, what Butterfi eld and the trio were up to, and he ordered the government 
to sell up to $4 million in gold, bringing the price back down. Th e trio sold their gold 
just before Grant issued his order. Although they no longer controlled the gold supply, 
they emerged very well-off . Many others who had invested in gold were ruined, 
and what became known as “Black Friday” created a signifi cant drag on the nation’s 
economy. Henry Adams, grandson and great-grandson of presidents, who was just 
beginning his own career as one of the nation’s major intellectuals, wrote: 
For the fi rst time since the creation of these enormous corporate bodies, one of 
them has shown its power for mischief, and has proved itself able to override 
and trample on law, custom, decency, and every restraint known to society, 
without scruple, and as yet without check. 
It would be another 30 years before there were effective checks on the corporate 
gamblers. 
Th e fortunes that the Vanderbilts, Drews, and others like them made in the 1870s 
and 1880s allowed them to spend lavishly, creating the public image of gilding a lily— 
a fl ower that when cut would be thrown away in a few days—with gold, a lot of gold. 
In grand parties in New York and at summer “cottages” or mansions in Newport, 
Rhode Island, or elsewhere, they showed off their wealth to the delight of some and 
the disgust of others. 
New Industries: Rockefeller’s Oil, Carnegie’s Steel, and Morgan’s 
Banking 
Before the 1800s were over, however, a new generation of corporate leaders exceeded the 
most optimistic hopes of the Vanderbilts and their generation. Among them was John 
D. Rockefeller, who, though he did not discover any oil nor invent new ways to refi ne 
oil into kerosene or gasoline, did discover new ways to make money from oil, amassing 
more money from the fuel than anyone had previously imagined possible. Mark Hanna, 
a childhood friend who later became President McKinley’s closest advisor, remembered 
saying of John D. that he was “sane in every respect save one—he was money mad!” 
When Rockefeller was 20 years old, he heard news that got as much national attention 
as John Brown’s raid on Harper’s Ferry that same year. On August 28, 1859, Edwin 
Drake struck oil while drilling a well near Titusville, Pennsylvania. “Rock oil” as the 
oil that came from the ground was called (as opposed to whale oil and oil refi ned from 
coal), was in great demand. Before the invention of electric lights in 1879, kerosene 
lights were the brightest and most popular form of illumination. Th ey were signifi cantly

brighter than candles and safer than gas lights. With kerosene lights, families could 
read in the evening, and the mills could start earlier and operate later. In addition, the 
machinery that the country was using, from railway engines to factory presses and 
looms, needed to be lubricated with oil to avoid seizing up. However, the oil had been 
scarce and expensive. Drake’s oil well signifi cantly changed the potential supply of oil. 
A rush ensued to sink oil wells in western Pennsylvania. Rockefeller, however, did 
not like the dirt or the risk of drilling in which some struck it rich while others with a 
dry well or two went bankrupt. (He also did not like the risk of fi ghting as a soldier and 
quickly paid the $300 for a substitute to fi ght for him in the Union army.) He focused 
instead on refi ning the oil that others produced. With two partners, Rockefeller built 
a refi nery in Cleveland where he could take advantage of nearby supplies of crude 
oil and get his products to market by using Great Lakes shipping and the rail lines 
between the East Coast and Chicago that ran through Cleveland. 
Rockefeller was determined to dominate the Cleveland refi ning market. He kept 
his products better and his prices lower than any of the competition. He quickly 
bought out his partners, one of whom later commented, “John had abiding faith in 
two things: the Baptist creed and oil.” He might have added that Rockefeller also had 
great faith in his own ability to strike a good bargain and manage his business, which 
meant cutting costs in every possible way. He brought in a new partner, Henry M. 
Flagler, who was as religious and as cost-conscious as himself. Rockefeller’s Cleveland 
refi nery was soon shipping more oil than any other in the region, which gave him 
great infl uence with the railroads. Jay Gould off ered a rebate to Rockefeller if he would 
ship on the Erie system, and Rockefeller accepted but then convinced the Erie’s primary 
competition, the Lake Shore Railroad, to give an even better one. When word 
of the secret rebates leaked out, other oil producers complained, but Rockefeller and 
Flagler had already made enough money to buy several of the competitors. 
John D. Rockefeller (1839–1937) created the Standard Oil Company which came to have monopoly 
control of the sales of oil in the United States making Rockefeller an extraordinarily rich man as he drove 
competitors out of business.

17.4 
In 1870, the Rockefeller–Flagler partnership became the Standard Oil Company, and 
the two set out to gain control of the nation’s oil business. Th ey bargained with oil producers 
to keep costs low. Th ey bought up every rival refi ning company they could, leaving 
producers with little option but to sell their oil to Standard Oil at whatever price Standard 
Oil was willing to pay. When a company would not sell to them, they went into direct 
competition, cutting prices, until the competitor either sold to Standard Oil or went out of 
business. Th ey created the Standard Oil Trust, a separate corporation, to buy up virtually 
every other refi nery in the nation. While competition kept prices low, Rockefeller thought 
competition was a terrible waste of eff ort and a drain on his profi ts, and he meant to end it. 
By the 1880s, companies under the control of Standard Oil refi ned nine out of 10 barrels 
of oil produced in the United States. Th is control over oil production came to be known 
as horizontal integration or, in cases like Standard Oil where nearly all of the industry 
was integrated, a horizontal monopoly. Standard Oil kept growing. Rockefeller produced 
his own tank cars and leased them to the railroads, making it diffi cult for competitors to 
transport oil. When pipelines started replacing oil tank cars, Standard Oil bought the pipelines. 
In the 1890s, tired of haggling with oil producers, Standard Oil simply started buying 
oil wells and became the largest producer and refi ner of oil in the nation. In the 1890s, the 
United States had no meaningful antimonopoly laws in force, and Rockefeller’s tireless 
work had made him the master of oil from its production to its refi ning to its sales. 
Just as Edison’s light bulb was starting to reduce demand for kerosene, Henry 
Ford’s automobiles created a demand for gasoline, refi ned from the same crude oil as 
kerosene. Automobiles would dwarf all previous markets for Standard Oil’s products. 
In addition, the world’s navies were also turning from sail to oil-powered steamships. 
Aft er 1900, everyone knew that with the development of these gas- and oil-powered 
vehicles, Standard Oil’s greatest days were still ahead (see Map 17-1 ). 
Andrew Carnegie was only a little older than Rockefeller. In 1848, when he was 12 
years old, his family came to the United States from his native Scotland aft er his father, 
a successful linen weaver, was thrown out of work by the mechanization of the industry. 
Andrew Carnegie’s fi rst job was in a textile mill in Allegheny, Pennsylvania, where 
he earned $1.20 per week. He soon moved to higher paying jobs and eventually became 
the personal assistant to the division superintendent of the Pennsylvania Railroad, a 
position in which he quickly learned the inner workings of American industry. 
Like Rockefeller, Carnegie paid someone to serve as his substitute in the Union 
army—a practice that was entirely legal, though ethically questionable, during the Civil 
War. In 1863, he decided to leave salaried work because he was confi dent he could make 
more money by investing, and he valued his independence. He advised others that the 
key to success was “Put all your eggs in one basket and then watch that basket.” Carnegie’s 
basket was steel, which he quickly realized was coming to dominate American commerce. 
In the early 1870s, Carnegie persuaded several investors to join him in opening 
a new state-of-the-art steel mill just outside Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh was near the coal 
fi elds, and steel mills used a lot of coal. Th e location was also near rivers and competing 
railroad lines, so no one rail line could squeeze Carnegie’s profi ts. Having established 
himself as the head of a giant corporation, Carnegie, like Rockefeller, set out to 
dominate the fi eld. He found ways to track and cut costs. Seeing him around the plant 
looking at inventories, one foreman said, “Th ere goes that damned bookkeeper.” He 
replaced wood buildings, which could burn, with iron ones; he developed an assembly 
line approach to steel production; and he constantly updated and replaced equipment. 
Carnegie built or bought everything needed for the steel business, from the coal 
mines to the coke ovens that prepared fuel to the iron mines that produced iron ore. 
He purchased railroads and steamships to transport the coal and ore to Pittsburgh. 
In addition, he did whatever was needed to keep workers’ salaries as low as possible. 
He once said, “Show me your cost sheets. It is more interesting to know how well and 
how cheaply you have done this thing than how much money you have made.” Other 
steel mill owners who worried only about profi ts were defeated by Carnegie’s constant 
focus on costs.

By the late 1890s, Carnegie Steel was the largest single company in the steel 
business. In contrast to the Standard Oil Trust, which was the model of horizontal 
monopoly, controlling all of the nation’s oil refi ning, Carnegie Steel was the model 
of vertical integration , controlling all means of steel production from raw materials 
through sales. For Carnegie, those means included the materials of coal and iron in 
the ground, the mining and transport of the materials, and the production and sales 
of the steel that came from these materials. Like Rockefeller, Carnegie became a very 
rich man.

More important than enjoying a lavish lifestyle and sometimes supporting various 
charities, emerging corporate leaders used their money to ensure their political infl uence 
and power. While Rockefeller and Carnegie were the best known, and probably 
the most successful, builders of monopoly trusts, other leaders built monopolies and 
grew almost as rich. In 1892, the New York World listed 3,045 millionaires in the United 
States. Gustavus Swift dominated meat, Charles Pillsbury grain, Henry Havemeyer 
sugar, Frederick Weyerhaeuser lumber, and James B. Duke tobacco. In addition, companies 
in other fi elds established trusts as they replaced competition with easier and 
more profi table coordination—the cottonseed oil trust, the linseed oil trust, the lead 
mining trust, the whiskey distilling trust, and the cord (rope) manufacturing trust. Free 
enterprise, as previous generations had known it, was quickly being replaced by a single 
corporation or trust that had many employees who simply took orders while the trust 
dominated the market for its product, ending competition and setting prices that consumers 
large and small had no choice but to pay or do without the product. Th e owners 
of these trusts had enough political power to make sure that no government intervened. 
While Rockefeller and Carnegie were amassing their fortunes, another American 
was amassing the greatest economic power that the country had ever seen. Although 
never as personally wealthy as Rockefeller or Carnegie, John Pierpont Morgan was the 
banker that everyone else, including the richest industrialists and oft en the U.S. government, 
looked to. Like Rockefeller and Carnegie, Morgan was born in the 1830s, and like 
them, he paid for a substitute rather than let the Civil War divert him from banking. 
In the fi nancial chaos of the Civil War, Morgan launched J.P. Morgan & Company. 
During the war, Morgan made great profi ts. He once sold reconditioned army rifl es 
back to the federal government at a considerable profi t. Working with European banks, 
Morgan helped fi nance the transcontinental railroad in the United States and the Suez 
Canal in the Middle East (both of which were completed in 1869). Using his skill and 
formidable resources, Morgan helped pick up the pieces of the American economy 
aft er the collapse of Jay Cooke & Company had launched the Panic of 1873. 
In 1877, after Cornelius Vanderbilt died, Morgan helped Vanderbilt’s son, 
William, sell off some shares of the New York Central Railroad. In return Morgan 
got a $3 million fee but, more valuable to him, a seat on the board of directors of the 
New York Central. He helped others with similar sales and gained seats for himself 
on other equally powerful boards. As a result, Morgan knew more about American 
industries than any other banker. In particular, he knew that the railroads were overbuilt 
and he was determined to reduce the competition among them. 
In the late 1880s, two of the largest railroads, the New York Central and the 
Pennsylvania Railroad, ran competing lines from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh and from 
New York to Chicago. Morgan decided to be a very forceful peacemaker. He invited— 
or summoned—the principal directors of each railroad to his yacht, the Corsair , and 
then ordered the captain to sail up and down the Hudson until fi nally, in exhaustion, 
they agreed to a settlement. Th e result of the agreement—some called it collusion—was 
better organization and higher profi ts for both lines, especially for stockholders and 
directors like Morgan himself, who also always collected a heft y fee for his services, but 
at considerable cost to shippers who had benefi tted from the cutthroat competition. 
The Panic of 1893 showed Morgan’s power as much as prosperity did. In May 
1893, the National Cordage Company, known as the rope trust, which was producing 
far more rope than the market demanded and issuing far too many promissory notes, 
went bankrupt, launching a major drop in stock prices among related businesses. In 
an economy as deeply interconnected as the U.S. economy had become, a drop in 
one area meant a drop in many others. In the course of the ensuing depression, the 
Philadelphia and Reading, Northern Pacifi c, Union Pacifi c, and Santa Fe Railroads as 
well as a host of other businesses all followed into bankruptcy. 
People much lower on the economic scale also felt the depression, sometimes 
more so. In the fall of 1893, a Methodist minister from Lincoln, Nebraska, told the 
17.1

story of “an honest Methodist farmer” who sold his year’s harvest for $31 and “with 
this he paid his taxes and half his grocery bill, and went home without dinner because 
there was not a nickel left in his pocket.” A lot of honest Methodist, Baptist, and 
Presbyterian farmers were in the same boat, as well as factory workers and members 
of the rising middle class who lost their jobs and their hopes in the 1893 depression. 
As European investors watched the collapse of the U.S. economy, they started 
withdrawing gold held in U.S. banks. The European run on the U.S. gold supply 
almost bankrupted the U.S. government. At the beginning of 1895, the federal government’s 
gold supply, kept in vaults in New York City, was $100 million. By the end 
of January, it was down to $50 million and falling quickly as investors withdrew their 
gold. In early February, Morgan traveled from New York to Washington, DC, in his 
private rail car to off er help. President Grover Cleveland, a Democrat, did not want

by 1901) and laid the foundation for his late-in-life generosity that 
built Carnegie libraries and created the Carnegie Corporation of 
New York in 1911. 
The price which society pays for the law of competition, like 
the price it pays for cheap comforts and luxuries, is also great; 
but the advantage of this law are also greater still, for it is to this law 
that we owe our wonderful material development, which brings 
improved conditions in its train.…We accept and welcome therefore, 
as conditions to which we must accommodate ourselves, great 
inequality of environment, the concentration of business, industrial 
and commercial, in the hands of a few, and the law of competition 
between these, as being not only beneficial, but essential for the 
future progress of the race.…The question then arises…What is the 
proper mode of administering wealth after the laws upon which 
civilization is founded have thrown it into the hands of the few?… 
There are but three modes in which surplus wealth can be 
disposed of. It can be left to the families of the decedents; or 
it can be bequeathed for public purposes; or, finally, it can be 
administered during their lives by its possessors.…Why should 
men leave great fortunes to their children? If this is done from 
affection, is it not misguided affection? Observation teaches that, 
generally speaking, it is not well for the children that they should 
be so burdened. Neither is it well for the state.… 
As to the second mode, that of leaving wealth at death for public 
uses, it may be said that this is only a means for the disposal of wealth, 
provided a man is content to wait until he is dead before it becomes 
of much good in the world.…Besides this, it may fairly be said that no 
man is to be extolled for doing what he cannot help doing… 
There remains, then, only one mode of using great fortunes… 
Under its sway we shall have an ideal state, in which the surplus 
wealth of the few will become, in the best sense the property 
of the many, because administered for the common good, and 
this wealth, passing through the hands of the few, can be made 
a much more potent force for the elevation of our race than if it 
had been distributed in small sums to the people themselves.… 
This, then, is held to be the duty of the man of Wealth: First, 
to set an example of modest, unostentatious living, shunning 
display or extravagance; to provide moderately for the legitimate 
wants of those dependent upon him; and after doing so 
to consider all surplus revenues which come to him simply as 
trust funds, which he is called upon to administer, and strictly 
bound as a matter of duty to administer in the manner which, 
in his judgment, is best calculated to produce the most beneficial 
results for the community—the man of wealth thus becoming 
the mere agent and trustee for his poorer brethren, bringing 
to their service his superior wisdom, experience and ability to 
administer, doing for them better than they would or could do 
for themselves.… 
Such, in my opinion, is the true Gospel concerning Wealth, 
obedience to which is destined some day to solve the problem of 
the Rich and the Poor, and to bring “Peace on earth, among men 
of Good-Will”

Thinking Critically 
1. Documentary Analysis 
In Carnegie’s view, what importance should be attached to 
economic inequality? How did he believe the wealthy should 
use their fortunes? 
2. Crafting an Argument 
Defend or refute the following statement. “Andrew Carnegie’s 
views on wealth were nothing more than a thinly veiled effort 
to justify exploitation and social injustice.”

of—J. P. Morgan. However, by the time the two met, Morgan informed Cleveland 
(since Morgan always had the most up-to-date fi nancial information) that there was 
but $9 million in gold still available and that a $10 million draft was on its way. Th e 
banker told the president, “You can’t meet it. It will be over before three o’clock.” 
Morgan also had a solution to off er. He reminded the president and the treasury 
secretary of a long-forgotten piece of Civil War legislation that said, “Th e Secretary of 
the Treasury may purchase coin with any of the bonds or notes of the United States, 
authorized by law, at such rates and upon such terms as he may deem most advantageous 
to the public interest.” He then off ered $65 million in gold in return for 30-year 
government bonds. Th e president asked Morgan whether he could promise that the 
deal—which not only provided gold but put the full faith and credit of the House of 
Morgan behind the credit of the United States—would end the rush on the treasury 
and Morgan said, “Yes sir, I will guarantee it.” 
Th e deal worked. European bankers who had lost faith in the United States had 
faith in Morgan. Th ey bought the bonds and stopped demanding payments in gold. 
Th e government had been protected from going the way of National Cordage and the 
Reading Railroad. Th e publisher Joseph Pulitzer called the deal an “excellent arrangement 
for the bankers,” but “[f]or the nation it means a scandalous surrender of credit 
and a shameful waste of substance.” Morgan made a fortune on the deal but also saved 
the U.S. economy. In the absence of any federal bank, the House of Morgan essentially 
served that role until the Federal Reserve Bank was created in 1916. 
No project of J.,P. Morgan’s was as great, however, as the one he launched in 1900. 
It began with the kind of competition that Morgan always hated. Illinois Steel, which 
Morgan had helped fi nance, was making a direct run at Carnegie Steel for control of the 
market. Charles Schwab, one of Carnegie’s partners, organized a holiday dinner with 
Morgan to see whether they could work out a deal to end the competition. Carnegie 
had talked of retiring, and his wife was anxious for him to enjoy life and devote himself 
full time to his charities. Carnegie was asked his price and, aft er a night’s sleep, off ered 
to sell Carnegie Steel for $480 million. Morgan agreed and later shook Carnegie’s hand 
saying, “Mr. Carnegie, I want to congratulate you on being the richest man in the 
world.” Morgan, Schwab, and Elbert Gary, the head of Illinois Steel, then negotiated 
with Rockefeller, whom Morgan disliked personally, to buy out Rockefeller’s ownership 
of iron deposits in the Mesabi Range and the ore boats that went with them. In 
March 1901, Morgan announced the creation of the U.S. Steel Corporation, bringing 
together Carnegie’s formidable assets, Illinois Steel, the Rockefeller iron mines, and 
other assets worth a total of $1.4 billion, the largest corporation ever seen at the time. 
Th e giant monopoly corporation was now the dominating fi xture of the U.S. economy.

LIVES OF THE MIDDLE CLASS IN THE GILDED AGE 
Analyze daily life, popular ideas, and political direction for the middle class during the 
Gilded Age. 
During the Gilded Age, what came to be known as middle-class values emerged in 
the United States. More Americans than ever before achieved a level of comfort and 
social respectability that, while it was a long way from the wealth of the Rockefellers, 
Carnegies, and Morgans, was also a long way from the poverty of most of rural America 
or those who worked on the railroads or in the refi neries. As Americans moved from 
farms to towns, some of the urban residents became comfortable professionals and 
managers and, in the process, created a set of norms for “middle-class respectability” 
that had not been known before.

Middle-Class Life and Expectations 
John Lewis came to the United States from Great Britain before the Civil War and got 
a job in the wholesale grocery business in New York City. By the 1870s, Lewis was the 
proprietor of his own store and a solid member of America’s emerging urban middle 
class. While achieving a middle-class life for himself and his family, Lewis wrote letters 
to his brother in England describing his life. For the Christmas of 1875, Lewis took 
the train to visit relatives in Philadelphia. In addition to the feasting, which greatly 
impressed Lewis, he also noted the Christmas tree decorations: 
As large and fi ne a tree as can be accommodated being procured and set up, 
it is covered with every conceivable shape into which coloured and gilt paper 
and card can be cut and…little pictures, glass balls, chains, garlands &c, anything 
to make a gay and imposing display. 
Lewis also noted that the enjoyment of the trees seemed to be a prime adult occupation 
while the children wanted candy. He noted, “Th e candy stores are among the gayest 
and most prosperous, and the consumption of their wares by women and children all 
the year round is enormous and is oft en spoken of by writers as a great national failing.” 
In maintaining his own store, traveling easily from city to city, celebrating holidays 
with feasts, decorations, and parties, Lewis was participating in the emerging middleclass 
culture of the late 1800s. Before the Civil War, Christmas celebrations among 
American Protestants were limited aff airs, but aft er the war, the fondness for that holiday, 
and the economic resources to celebrate more grandly than ever before, grew 
rapidly. A larger group of people had the resources to own homes, decorate them, and 
travel to visit relatives than in any previous generation in the United States. 
Th ose in the rising urban middle class were redesigning not only their private homes 
but also their expectations, particularly for city buildings and services that supported 
their emerging tastes and desires. Huge new department stores off ered the opportunity 
to shop for the things that middle-class people, like John Lewis, wanted in their 
lives. Th e architect Daniel Burnham, the leading voice of what came to be known as 
the City Beautiful movement, designed public buildings in a classical style that showed 
a permanence and beauty that this emerging class expected. City Beautiful planned 
major revitalization eff orts in Washington, DC, Cleveland, San Francisco, and Chicago, 
designing buildings such as the grand new Boston Public Library, based on the model 
of a Renaissance palazzo; the new building for the Library of Congress, which was completed 
in 1897; and the new New York Stock Exchange that opened in 1903. 
Architect David Burnham’s City Beautiful movement made its debut in 1893 at the World’s Columbian 
Exposition, Chicago, Illinois. In this photograph, the Palace of Mechanic Arts and lagoon showcase the 
classical style that characterized the movement.

Th e architect Louis Sullivan, Burnham’s professional rival, sought a much simpler 
and, he said, more American style of architecture that refl ected the energy of a culture 
that constructed buildings soaring to heights previously unimagined. Sullivan hated 
classical Renaissance style and preferred more simple lines. Frederick Law Olmsted 
designed major new park systems, including Central Park in New York, Boston’s 
chain of connected parks around the city known as the Emerald Necklace, and the 
Mall in Washington, DC, all of which spoke to the commitment to beauty and permanence 
for a new and growing class of people who had the time and inclination to use 
such public spaces for leisure and uplift ing pastimes. 
While architects designed new buildings and park systems designed to show permanence 
and prosperity, other urban planners found ways to make cities more livable 
for the growing middle class or to help the middle class to escape what they found 
diffi cult to live with. Th ese planners found new ways to bring pure water into city 
neighborhoods, perhaps most important to the life—and health—of city dwellers. 
Cholera and other waterborne diseases had long been a fact of city life. Once a cholera 
epidemic began to spread, wealth and class did little to protect people from it. Cities, 
like small towns, tended to depend on well water and on small, individual cisterns that 
collected rain water for their water supply. However, in growing urban areas, stagnant 
cisterns were a breeding ground for disease, and wells easily became contaminated. 
Beginning in 1842, New York started building a reservoir for water to be piped into 
the city from rural areas to provide a healthier water supply. As New York grew, a 
large new plan—the New Croton Aqueduct—was built from 1885 to 1893 to bring 
water to all of the city’s neighborhoods. Other cities followed the same pattern. Water, 
which had been a source of disease, became one of the healthiest aspects of urban life. 
Even as city life improved, many in the middle class wanted to put some distance 
between themselves and the cities. Railroads, which had initially connected cities over 
long distances, began to build shorter lines that would allow people who worked in 
cities to live in suburbs—a new development in American life during the Gilded Age. 
Th ey commuted between their homes in semirural settings and their work in the commercial 
centers of urban America. Cities also quickly took to adding electric lights 
that kept cities alive at night, electric elevators that allowed much taller buildings to be 
built, and electric trolleys that made it easier to get from one part of a city to another. 
Th e cities of the Gilded Age were cleaner, brighter, and faster paced than anything 
known in the United States before that time. 
Gilded Age Religion 
The Gilded Age saw new levels of religious activity among white middle-class 
Protestants. Most of the middle class were, indeed, both white and Protestant, and they 
viewed themselves as living in a “Christian America,” by which they meant a Protestant 
Christian culture. Between 1860 and 1900, the major Protestant denominations—the 
Methodists, Baptists, Presbyterians, Congregationalists, and Episcopalians—tripled 
their membership from 5 million to 16 million. Americans not only joined Protestant 
churches but also participated in nondenominational religious organizations, including 
the YMCA as well as Bible, mission, and social reform societies. Th e theology that 
was being preached changed with the times, becoming more individualistic and more 
optimistic. And no one represented the changes in white American Protestantism as 
much as the great revivalist of the era, Dwight L. Moody. 
Like many Americans of his generation—the same generation as Rockefeller, 
Carnegie, and Morgan—Moody grew up on a farm but moved to a city. When the 
Civil War began, Moody gave up his shoe business to work full time for the YMCA. 
He led a Sunday school for poor immigrant children and supported the YMCA’s 
social service missions. By 1875, Moody had an international reputation. He launched 
the Northfi eld and Mount Hermon schools as well as a new Bible training school in 
Chicago in 1886 that eventually became the Moody Bible Institute.

Another prominent minister, Lyman Abbott, described Moody’s preaching 
in 1899 saying, “As he stood on the platform, he looked like a business man; he 
dressed like a business man; he took the meeting in hand as a business man would.” 
If other business men were dominating the culture and the economy, a preacher who 
acted like a business man could be a success. Moody did not shout. He gave a simple 
message focused on the need for conversion and the love of God. Th e preacher was 
deeply critical of both sides in the growing debates that pitted liberal biblical scholarship 
against those who insisted the Bible was the literal truth. He did not see any fresh 
views on either side of the argument and wondered whether both could not just “let us 
get on with the practical work of the kingdom.” 
Th e sins Moody denounced were attending the theater, disregarding the Sabbath, 
and believing atheistic teachings. Coming home to Jesus was the key for Moody, and 
home and Jesus oft en represented the same thing. He preached a gospel perfectly fi tted 
to the growing sense of individualism in the United States. In describing his mission, 
he said, “I look upon this world as a wrecked vessel. God has given me a lifeboat and 
said to me, ‘Moody, save all you can.’” 
Ira D. Sankey’s music was as important as the preaching at Moody’s revivals. 
Some of the most popular hymns that Sankey led people in singing were written by 
Fanny J. Crosby, who wrote over 8,000 of them. Th e hymns, like the popular Pass Me 
Not, O Gentle Saviour, refl ect an individualistic faith in which the focus is on divine 
comfort and love far more than on sin, divine judgment, or great social change. 
Protestant Americans sang these hymns during Sunday morning services and at 
home around a piano—which those of the emerging middle class could now aff ord. 
Electoral Politics 
Between 1876 and 1896, electoral politics refl ected the dominant middle-class interests 
of the era. While groups within the major parties and new political parties like the 
Populists (see Chapter 18 ) protested against the poverty and corruption that was part 
Electric lights, electronic trolleys, and fast-moving trains not only speeded transportation but also created a new 
kind of energized night life in cities like New York.

of the backdrop of the Gilded Age, the major parties, Republicans and Democrats 
alike, refl ected the ideas and aspirations of the middle and upper classes. In a nation 
where a few were growing exorbitantly wealthy and a larger number were moving 
into new comforts, the leaders of the political parties had no interest in challenging 
the status quo. 
In the 1870s and 1880s, the Republican Party was the political voice of most corporate 
leaders and most Protestants outside of the South. But the party was split 
between the heirs of the antislavery wing of the party— Stalwarts they called themselves—
and others who believed that it was time to forget about slavery and the goals 
of Reconstruction and simply embrace the nation’s growing prosperity. The party 
was also split along lines of personal animosity, none deeper than the hatred between 
Roscoe Conkling, Stalwart leader of the New York delegation in the Congress, and 
James G. Blaine, a Congressman from Maine since 1862 who had quickly risen over 
many more senior members to be Speaker of House. Blaine was among those ready 
to focus on the future; embrace the economy that Rockefeller, Carnegie, and Morgan 
were creating for the nation; and forget about reform eff orts, whether in the form of 
the now-fading Reconstruction goals or the needs of the urban poor. Blaine was a man 
of great charm and eloquence but oft en seen as being too smooth and probably a participant 
in some of the worse corruption of the Grant administration. 
After the tensions of the 1876 Hayes-Tilden election (see Chapter 15 ), the 
Republicans did not want to renominate President Hayes and turned instead to 
another Civil War veteran and compromise candidate from Ohio, James A. Garfi eld, 
who defeated the Democrats’ Union war hero Winfield Scott Hancock in the 
November 1880 election. Unlike many in either political party, Garfi eld was committed 
to civil service reform—ending the use of government jobs to reward political 
favorites—and to uniting Stalwarts and their opponents. His running mate was the 
New York customs collector Chester A. Arthur, better known for his ability to fi nd 
government jobs for friends than for any reform agenda. Th ree months aft er the inauguration, 
Garfi eld was shot by a disgruntled offi ce seeker, and although he seemed to 
be healing from his wounds, he died on September 19, 1881. Arthur became the president 
and, as some said, served a less undistinguished term than expected. 
In 1884, Blaine was determined to stop Arthur’s renomination. He tried hard 
to convince yet another war hero, William T. Sherman, to run for president, but 
Sherman’s unequivocal response was, “If nominated I will not run, if elected I will not 
serve.” Eventually, the Republicans gave Blaine his turn as their candidate. 
Governor Grover Cleveland was the Democratic nominee. Cleveland had fought 
corruption when he was mayor of Buffalo, New York, a reputation that propelled 
him to the governor’s offi ce in 1882 and only 2 years later to the White House. Given 
Cleveland’s reputation for honesty and Blaine’s for corruption, a number of long-time 
Republicans campaigned for the Democrats. Th ese party crossovers became known 
as Mugwumps , a word they claimed came from an Indian word for “big chief” but 
that their opponents said meant someone whose mug was on one side of a fence while 
their “wump” was on the other. 
In the midst of the 1884 campaign, a preacher from Buff alo revealed that Cleveland 
had fathered a child with a young widow, Maria Halpin, and then paid child support. 
Cleveland supporters said that Halpin had many boyfriends and that Cleveland was 
only protecting the others, some of whom were married. Th e nominee ordered his 
campaign to “Tell the truth.” While the nation faced serious economic choices, the 
campaigns fell to chanting “Blaine, Blaine, James G. Blaine, continental liar from the 
state of Maine,” against “Ma, ma, where’s my pa?” Just before the election, another 
preacher who supported Blaine castigated the Democrats as the “party of rum, 
Romanism, and rebellion,” a phrase that may have cost the Republicans key Catholic 
votes in New York state where Cleveland won by only 1,100 votes, which gave him a 
majority in the Electoral College.

A faction of the Republican Party in the 1870s 
and 1880s who wanted the party to stay true

Cleveland was not signifi cantly diff erent than the Republicans who served before 
him, though he did take a strong stand against the annexation of Hawaii and other 
expansionist eff orts that Republicans had been pursuing. But as African-Americans in 
the South suff ered from ever-increasing segregation and inequality, white and black 
farmers faced poverty, and workers began eff orts to organize unions to end starvation 
wages, Cleveland, like the Republicans, tended to ignore their needs or, when pushed, 
sided with the corporations and their owners (see Chapter 18 ) . 
In a close race, Cleveland was defeated for reelection in 1888 by the Republican 
nominee, Civil War general and presidential grandson Benjamin Harrison, whose 
main campaign issues were Cleveland’s veto of a pension bill for all Civil War veterans 
and Cleveland’s return of Civil War banners to Southern states. A tactic called “waving 
the bloody shirt”—reminding everyone in the North that Republicans had won 
the Civil War while Democrats represented the states of the Confederacy—seemed to 
win elections for Republicans. Yet 4 years later, Cleveland, in a return match, defeated 
Harrison and served a second term from 1893 to 1897—the only president in history 
to serve nonconsecutive terms. It was Cleveland’s bad luck to begin his second term 
just as the Panic of 1893 began, and while his negotiations with J. P. Morgan may have 
avoided even worse disaster, the economic crisis of 1893 hurt many Americans. Th e 
political stability of the 1870s and 1880s seemed to be coming to an end in the 1890s. 
Global Connections 
American influence around the world grew dramatically during the Gilded Age. 
Americans had been sending missionaries to foreign countries since the early 1800s, 
but far greater numbers went abroad in the 1880s and 1890s. Dwight L. Moody called 
on young converts to consider careers as foreign missionaries, and some of them 
launched the China Inland Mission to convert China. Another Moody convert, John 
R. Mott, organized the Student Volunteer Movement that eventually sent over 5,000 
missionaries to India, Africa, China, Japan, and the Middle East (the Movement later 
became the World Student Christian Federation). Individual churches and religious 
bodies sent their own preachers, teachers, and medical missionaries to all parts of the 
globe. Missionaries brought western values, a respect for human rights— especially 
women’s rights. However, they also brought American commercialism interests, 
17.3

While political leaders like Hayes, Garfi eld, and Cleveland vied for the presidency, many reformers were 
coming to the conclusion that the business trusts led by people like Rockefeller, Carnegie, and Morgan really 
controlled the country. This political cartoon from 1889 showed who many thought actually ran the Senate 
and the country.

perhaps unwittingly, to cultures that may or may not have wanted them. The missionaries 
were quickly followed by merchants and industrialists, though missionaries 
sometimes led the protests against the commercialization of international relations. 
Returning missionaries became the voice of the world in many American communities, 
describing people and cultures unfamiliar to American audiences. 
Missionaries were far from the only Americans to visit other parts of the globe 
during the Gilded Age. As the United States grew in population and industrial 
production, it became a player of growing importance in world markets, second 
only to Great Britain. After the Panic of 1873, many worried that the rapid 
growth in U.S. industrial productivity could become a problem rather than a 
boon. If the country produced more and more and depended only on domestic 
markets, then prices and income were doomed to keep falling. The only solution, 
some argued, was to find foreign markets, lots of foreign markets, to be sure 
that American products were sold all over the world, bringing new income to 
American producers. Exporting goods was nothing new to the United States, but 
after 1870, many U.S. business leaders intensified exporting efforts to sustain the 
nation’s economy. The total value of U.S. exports jumped from $234 million in 
1865 to $1.5 billion in 1900, and the country was transformed from a debtor to a 
creditor nation. 
In terms of commercial efforts, the United States had long been interested in 
Cuba. Southern Senators regularly suggested making the island a slave state before 
the Civil War, and in 1854, the American ambassadors to Europe’s leading powers 
issued the so-called Ostend Manifesto, demanding that Spain sell Cuba to the United 
States. Aft er the Civil War, Cuba was no longer of value as a slave state, but interest 
in the island never disappeared from American politics. When a rebellion against 
Spanish rule broke out in Cuba in1868, perhaps 100,000 Cubans died as a result while 
the island’s economy was devastated. U.S. merchants took advantage of the situation 
and bought sugar plantations, mines, and ranches in Cuba while U.S. diplomats 
forged an agreement with Spain for free and open trade between the island and the 
United States. By 1890, the United States was the dominant economic force on the 
island, and trade with Cuba was important for the U.S. economy. 
The United States also had longstanding interests in Mexico. During the Civil 
War, Napoleon III had sent French troops to Mexico, installing Austrian Archduke 
Maximilian and his wife Carlotta as rulers of the country. Secretary of State Seward 
warned the French that their meddling was an “act of hostility,” and U.S. General 
Philip Sheridan informed Mexican revolutionaries that he had placed a substantial 
supply of weapons at the border and would look the other way if they disappeared. 
Th e supply vanished, and Maximilian was overthrown by a new government led by 
reform-minded Benito Juárez. Maximilian was executed by a revolutionary firing 
squad in June 1867. Later, Porfi rio Díaz, who did not share Juárez’s reform agenda, 
claimed dictatorial power in Mexico. Diaz was anxious to expand U.S. investment 
in Mexico, and Americans bought railroads, mines, and oil exploration companies. 
By 1900, Americans had some $500 million invested in Mexico, enough to make the 
country a major trading partner and, indeed, to give American businesses signifi cant 
infl uence in the Mexican economy and political life. Some feared Mexico was becoming 
almost an economic satellite of the United States. 
U.S. commercial interests extended far beyond the Americas. In the 1870s, 
Belgium’s King Leopold II created a private colony around the Congo River in Africa. 
It was a brutal aff air. Residents of the Congo were pressed into slave labor on the vast 
rubber plantations that were meeting growing demands for rubber, and they were 
making Leopold very rich. Anxious to gain a new market, some businessmen persuaded 
President Arthur to recognize King Leopold’s rule as the legitimate government 
of the Congo in 1884; however, Arthur’s successor, Grover Cleveland reduced 
U.S. involvement in light of the violent conditions.

In Europe, the growth of U.S. exports almost provoked a trade war between the 
United States and Europe’s leading economic powers, including Britain, Germany, 
and France. Bad harvests in Europe starting in 1879 led to significant demand for 
American food, lift ing the U.S. economy out of the last vestiges of the Panic of 1873. 
But European governments became nervous about their growing dependence on U.S. 
food and claimed that U.S. pork and beef was not safe, leading to a huge fall off in 
exports. Th e New York Herald urged “avenging the American hog” with a boycott 
of French wine and German sugar, but an eventual compromise led meat exports to 
be doubled. 
In Asia, a U.S. Navy squadron sailed to Korea in 1867 but was sent away. But the 
U.S. Navy kept trying, as it had with Japan and China, and in 1882, Korea agreed to 
open itself to U.S. markets. Th e two governments signed the Treaty of Chemulpo 
aft er which Korean offi cers studied at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and 
the Brooklyn Navy Yard. While Korea remained a relatively small trading partner, 
the determination to open a country known as the “Hermit Kingdom” was typical 
of the era. From Korea to Latin America, the Congo, and Europe, the United States 
emerged from the Gilded Age as a trading partner of some importance not only in 
familiar countries but also in parts of the world previous generations had barely 
heard about.

IMMIGRATION 
Explain the reasons immigrants came to the United States in such large numbers during 
the Gilded Age and what their experience was. 
In the 75 years between 1815 and 1890, 15 million people immigrated to the United 
States, the great majority from northern Europe—Britain, Ireland, Germany, 
Scandinavia, Switzerland, and Holland. In the next 25 years, from 1890 until the start 
of World War I in 1914, 15 million additional immigrants came to the United States, 
and those immigrants came from new places—80 percent of them from Italy, Greece, 
Russia, the Empire of Austria-Hungary, Rumania, and Turkey, and others from Japan, 
China, and Korea, as well as Mexico and other parts of Latin America. With their 
arrival, they changed the complexion of the nation. What all these immigrants had in 
common was a “push-pull” experience in which various factors pushed them to leave 
their home countries and, at the same time, other factors pulled them to try a new life 
in the United States. 
The Push from Around the World 
When Sadie Frowne described the desperate poverty of Poland or when the Lithuanian, 
Antanas Kaztauskis, expressed his family’s fear that he was about to be draft ed into the 
Russian army, they were relating reasons that pushed hundreds of thousands of people 
to move not only from southern and eastern Europe—Italy, Greece, Poland, Russia, 
and so on—but also from China, Japan, and Korea to start new lives in the United 
States. Most of those who emigrated to the United States between 1890 and World War 
I did so in large part because something, oft en grinding poverty and fear of persecution, 
pushed them to get out of the places where they and their families had lived for 
many generations, and the pull of hoped-for new lives and new prosperity attracted 
them to the United States (see Map 17-2 ). 
Nowhere was the push to leave greater than in Russia and Russian-dominated 
parts of eastern Europe including the Ukraine, Lithuania, and Poland. Abraham 
Cahan, who came to the United States from Russia as a young man, explained what

drove him: “The government itself had set off the pogroms in order to save the 
throne from a revolutionary upheaval. By making the Jews the scapegoats, it had 
confused the common people so that in the end the peasants were certain that the 
Jews and not the Czar were the cause of their troubles.” Golda Meir, who became 
a school teacher in Milwaukee and one day would be Prime Minister of Israel, 
remembered, 
I can still recall distinctly hearing about a pogrom that was to descend on us… 
with the rabble that used to surge through town, brandishing knives and huge 
sticks, screaming ‘Christ killers’ as they looked for the Jews. 
Pogroms —anti-Jewish attacks —became increasingly common in Russia at the end 
of the 1800s. Th ey were not only tolerated but also oft en actively encouraged by the 
Russian government and the Russian Orthodox Church. 
Aft er the assassination of Czar Alexander II in 1881, the government ordered that 
all Jews in Russia must move to the Pale of Settlement, a region that stretched from 
the Baltic in the north to the Black Sea in the south. Jews were not allowed to travel 
into the rest of Russia. Within the Pale, though there was a thriving Jewish community 
and culture, there was desperate poverty. Jews were not allowed to own land. Another 
immigrant remembered, “Th ere were ten times as many stores as there should have 
been, ten times as many tailors, cobblers, barbers, tinsmiths.” Leaving Russia seemed 
the only solution to such conditions. 
For Italian peasants there were no pogroms, but there was plenty of violence and 
poverty. When Italy was united as a nation in 1871—following a movement known 
as the Risorgimento —wealth and industry were concentrated in the north and the 
Mezzogiorno , as southern Italy was known, was a land of poverty where massive soil 
erosion made farming almost impossible. In 1906, Mount Vesuvius erupted, destroying 
towns and some of the rich grape-growing farmland that remained. Facing

Chapter 17 The Gilded Age Building a Technological and Industrial Giant and a New Social Order 529 
Sadie Frowne’s account of her move from a small village in Russia 
to become a garment worker New York City’s Lower East Side is 
representative of the life experience of thousands of immigrants. 
My mother…kept a little grocer’s shop in the little village 
where we lived at first. That was in Poland, somewhere on the 
frontier…She had a wagon in which she used to drive about 
the country, selling her groceries, and sometimes she worked 
in the fields with my father. 
When I was a little more than 10 years of age my father died. He 
was a good man and a steady worker, and we never knew what it 
was to be hungry while he lived. After he died troubles began, for 
the rent of our shop was about $6 a month, and then there were 
food and clothes to provide. We needed little, it is true, but even 
soup, black bread, and onions we could not always get.… 
Mother wrote to Aunt Fanny, who lived in New York, and told 
her how hard it was to live in Poland, and Aunt Fanny advised her 
to come and bring me.…She said we should both come at once, 
and she went around among our relatives in New York and took 
up a subscription for our passage. 
We came by steerage on a steamship in a very dark place that 
smelt dreadfully. There were hundreds of other people packed in 
with us, men, women and children, and almost all of them were 
sick. It took us 12 days to cross the sea, and we thought we should 
die, but at last the voyage was over and we came up and saw the 
beautiful bay and the big woman with the spikes on her head and 
the lamp that is lighted at night in her hand (Goddess of Liberty).… 
So I went to work in Allen Street (Manhattan) in what they call 
a sweatshop, making skirts by machine. I was new at the work 
and the foreman scolded me a great deal.… 
In Poland I and my father and mother used to go to the synagogue 
on the Sabbath, but here the women don’t go to the synagogue 
much, though the men do. They are shut up working hard 
all week long, and when the Sabbath comes they like to sleep 
long in bed and afterward they must go out where they can 
breathe the air.… 
Some of the women blame me very much because I spend so 
much money on clothes. They say that instead of a dollar a week 
I ought not to spend more than 25c a week on clothes, and that 
I should save the rest. But a girl must have clothes if she is to go 
into good society at Ulmer Park or Coney Island or the theater. 
Those who blame me are the old country people who have oldfashioned 
notions, but the people who have been here a long 
time know better. A girl who does not dress well is stuck in a corner, 
even if she is pretty, and Aunt Fanny says that I do just right 
to put on plenty of style.

poverty, criminal gangs, and chaos, some 4 million Italians, almost all from the south, 
left Italy between 1880 and 1914. Unlike the Jews coming from Russia, many of the 
Italian immigrants hoped one day to return home aft er making some money, and perhaps 
one in four did return. Th ose who came, whether temporarily or permanently, 
settled in major American cities and took on some of the hardest work at the bottom 
ranks of the American economy. 
Russian Jews and southern Italian Catholics were far from alone. All across 
Europe, the population was growing faster than the land could support. Immigration 
provided a way out. Political upheaval in many places led to violence. Turkish violence 
against the Christian minority, especially the massacres of 1894, 1895, and 1896, 
led many Armenians to leave for America. Roman Catholics in Orthodox areas like 
Lithuania and Orthodox believers facing persecution in Catholic or Muslim countries 
wanted to move. 
Chinese immigrants had been coming to the West Coast since the Gold Rush of 1849, 
but poverty and continued political turmoil kept them coming, though the numbers 
were slowed signifi cantly aft er 1882 when Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act . 
Until 1882, immigration had been a relatively easy matter for the Chinese. If one could 
aff ord the passage, one simply booked it and then walked off the ship in San Francisco. 
Chinese Exclusion Act 
Federal legislation that suspended Chinese 
immigration, limited the civil rights of 
resident Chinese, and forbade their 
naturalization.

However, many in California and other parts of the West were threatened by the Chinese 
who by their sheer numbers increased the competition for jobs or mining claims. Aft er 
a string of anti-immigrant petitions led Congress to change the law—the fi rst time an 
entire nationality was barred from the country—only Chinese who could prove to the 
satisfaction of new immigration agents that they were either returning citizens or that 
they brought with them educational, economic, or diplomatic skills were allowed into 
the United States. Japanese immigrants, however, began to arrive, especially aft er 1885 
when the emperor ended a ban on emigration and increased taxes to build up the government, 
causing many farmers to lose their fi elds. 
In addition, about 300,000 French-Canadians moved from Quebec into the United 
States between 1860 and 1900, especially into New England and New York. Remote 
villages in Mexico experienced almost constant revolutionary violence in the late 
1800s and early 1900s as regime followed regime. As a result, many Mexicans moved 
across the Rio Grande into the United States to fi nd jobs on farms, mines, or fi elds 
in Texas and California, greatly expanding an earlier Mexican-American community 
that had been in the United States since the changing border made them Americans in 
the 1840s. Eventually some 4 million Italians, 2 million Russian Jews (one-third of all 
of the Jews in Russia), and 9 million other immigrants from almost every other part of 
the planet came to the United States in the 30-year period before 1920. 
The Pull from an Industrializing United States 
While there was good reason to leave Russia or Italy or Japan or Mexico, among other 
places, in the late 1800s, there were also reasons to want to come to the United States. 
The pull of opportunity was as important as the push of poverty and oppression. 
Although stories of the wealth to be found in the United States oft en led to terrible 
disappointment, the conditions in the United States were oft en still signifi cantly better 
than what immigrants had left behind. 
Prospective immigrants learned about jobs and opportunities from many sources. 
In a small village in Lithuania, Antanas Kaztauskis heard a man who lived in his village 
talk about the success of his son who was working in the stockyards in Chicago 
and who had sent his father a Lithuanian language newspaper from Chicago where 
the old man read of the rights of “life, liberty, and the getting of happiness.” 
American employers, oft en short of workers during economic boom times, advertised 
for help, even publishing a guidebook, Where to Emigrate and Why, in 1869. 
Steamship companies advertised for passengers, who could now, they claimed, take 
advantage of quicker travel times—14 days in 1867 and perhaps 6 days by 1900—all in 
safer and healthier conditions. 
In Japan, farmers heard that a plantation laborer in the Kingdom of Hawaii could 
earn six times more than in Japan. It might be possible in a few years of working in 
Hawaii or the United States to save enough to return home, buy new land and make a 
fresh start in Japan. Many Japanese women saw the opportunity to start a new life as 
a “picture bride” for a Japanese immigrant who was already in Hawaii or the United 
States. In a culture in which arranged marriages were the norm and in which women 
were encouraged to become educated and make their own way in the world, the idea 
of women, traveling to a new land, starting a new life with a new husband, did not 
seem so strange. Riyo Orite, said of her experience, “I was engaged at the age of 16 
and didn’t meet Orite until I was almost 18. I had seen him only in a picture at fi rst.… 
Being young, I was unromantic. I just believed that girls should get married.…[P] 
eople around me praised the match.” 
Mexicans who returned after spending time in the United States came back to 
families and friends with “shoes and good suits of clothes.” Others who moved north 
wrote to family and friends, “Come! Come! Come over, it is good here!” Jesus Garza 
remembered, “As I had heard a lot about the United States it was my dream to come 
here.” And many did come.

The Reality—Jobs, Cities, and Americanization 
When immigrants arrived in the United States, they did not always fi nd what they had 
been expecting or hoping for. Italian immigrants oft en summed up their experience: 
Back in the old country, the young and naïve immigrants had been told that 
the streets of America were paved with gold. But when they got here, they 
discovered three important things: First, the streets weren’t paved in gold; 
se cond, they weren’t paved at all; and third, they were expected to pave them. 
Few immigrants were quite as naïve as the story implies, but the popularity of the story in 
Italian immigrant communities says a lot about the reality of the immigration experience. 
When arriving immigrants from Europe first landed, the authorities were not 
always welcoming. New York was the prime point of entry. In 1892, the federal government 
built a new immigration center on Ellis Island in the harbor, which replaced 
the old one at Castle Garden at the tip of Manhattan. Ellis Island combined quarantine, 
customs, and reception. Twelve million people came through Ellis Island before 
it closed in 1954. It could be an intimidating experience as clerks asked a battery of 
questions, trying to be sure that no physically or mentally ill people or troublemakers 
were allowed into the country. Th ey did not make life easy for anyone. Nevertheless, 
only about two percent of those who arrived at Ellis Island were actually turned away. 
Th ose who were not permitted to enter typically either carried disease or came across 
in some way as unlikely to be able to support themselves. 
During this process at Ellis Island, the clerks oft en gave immigrants a new anglicized 
name. A Russian named Cooperstein became Cooper, a Finn named Huttama 
became Hanson, or a Greek named Kiriacopoulis became Campbell. In one case, a 
German Jew became so confused with all the questions he was being asked that he 
forgot his own name. When he responded to the clerk’s question about his name with 
“Ich vergesse” (“I forget”), the clerk registered him as Ferguson. 
Steamships from Europe also docked in Boston or Philadelphia where the government 
established similar centers. Immigrants from Canada and Mexico were sometimes 
processed at border crossing points, while at other times, they simply walked or 
rode across the long borders between the countries. In the Southwest, people had long 
traveled back and forth across the Rio Grande, and they did not stop doing so. 
On the Pacifi c coast, most immigrants came through the Port of San Francisco. In 
1910, the federal government created a processing center on Angel Island in San Francisco 
Bay that was designed to be a kind of West Coast Ellis Island. Over the next 30 years 
175,000 immigrants entered the United States through Angel Island, the vast majority of 
them Chinese. Similar but smaller stations were created in other ports, especially Seattle. 
Although Angel Island might have been designed as a counterpart to Ellis Island, it was 
a very diff erent place. At both islands, immigrants faced frightening medical inspections 
and batteries of questions from federal immigration agents. But while most of those coming 
through Ellis Island left within a day, many on Angel Island were kept for weeks or 
months, occasionally for years. From the time of the passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act 
in 1882 until changes in U.S. policy in 1943, only Chinese immigrants who could prove 
that they were returning U.S. citizens or the children of U.S. citizens were allowed into 
the country. Th e Chinese immigrant population was essentially frozen at its 1882 levels. 
However, the destruction of all federal records in the earthquake and fi re in San Francisco 
in April 1906 meant that if someone claimed to be a U.S. citizen, it was hard to disprove 
the claim. So-called “paper sons,” came to the United States with high hopes that they 
could answer the required questions and gain admission to a country where they could 
make some money and avoid the wars and famine in China. Some succeeded. Others were 
deported back to China. As a result, Angel Island became a place of constant tension. Paul 
Chow, whose parents had come through Angel Island, remembered the fear the place 
evoked in his family. “Whenever my mother would mention it, she’d say, ‘Angel Island, 
shhh,’” he said. “I thought it was all one word ‘Angelislandshh.’”

Although the phrase “ melting pot ” became a popular way to describe the infl ux 
of immigrants during the height of the immigration boom, the reality in United States 
was not quite what the popular phrase indicated. Th e term melting pot came from a 
play by Israel Zangwill, produced in New York in 1908, in which the hero wants to 
forget the pain of his life as a Jew in czarist Russia and announces that he is happy to 
be in America “God’s Crucible,” where he can be part of “the great Melting-Pot where 
all the races of Europe are melting and reforming.” In fact, many of those who arrived 
had no interest in “melting” into a common American culture but were, instead, creating 
a richly diverse nation of far more ethnic and cultural variety than had ever 
been seen before. 
For Jews arriving in New York, the next step aft er leaving Castle Garden or Ellis 
Island was oft en to make their way to the Lower East Side of Manhattan, the heart 
of the Jewish community. To be in the Lower East Side in the 1880s and 1890s was, 
as Rose Cohen said, as though “we were still in our village in Russia.” Th ere was little 
actual cultural melting going on, though people slowly took on more and more 
American ways. While one found friends there, living conditions were hard in some of 
those most crowded blocks in the country. Th e American Magazine described Lower 
East Side tenement housing in 1888: 
Th ey are great prison-like structures of brick, with narrow doors and windows, 
cramped passages and steep rickety stairs.…The narrow court-yard… 
in the middle is a damp foul-smelling place, supposed to do duty as an 
airshaft .…In the hot summer months…these fi re-escape balconies are used 
as sleeping-rooms by the poor wretches who are fortunate enough to have 
windows opening upon them. 
Bathrooms were at the end of the hall and were shared by multiple apartments. 
Most apartments were packed with people as families crowded into tiny rooms and 
took in borders who would help pay the rent. One 1908 survey found that 50 percent 
of families slept three or four persons to a room and another 25 percent had fi ve or 
more persons per room. 
Jewish immigrants found work where they could. Jewish peddlers sold nearly 
everything—fruit, vegetables, fish, clothing, kitchen utensils—filling streets like 
Melting pot 
An often popular idea that somehow immigrants 
from other countries should quickly 
lose their culture and language and “melt” 
into being just like other Americans. 
Arrival at Angel Island in San Francisco might mean long waits in confi ning conditions for Asian immigrants 
like these Japanese women.

Delancey Street with pushcart aft er pushcart, all selling something diff erent and trying 
to convince passers-by to purchase. Even more Jewish immigrants found work in 
the garment industry. Many Russian Jews had survived as tailors (the Singer sewing 
machine was a major export from the United States to Russia). In America, skill with 
a needle meant a job. Th e demand for uniforms for the Union army led to the establishment 
of standard sizes for clothing, fi rst for men and later for women, and this 
change allowed the development of mass-produced rather than individualized clothing. 
Because of the development of standard sizes, the garment trade was able to shift 
from made-to-order work for the elite to mass production of clothing for everyone. 
Men’s suits and pants, women’s dresses and shirtwaists, as blouses were called, were 
produced in the thousands, making the clothing business a major industry. 
At fi rst, garment work was done at home as families or small groups took in piece 
work and returned the fi nished products. Later, larger factories, known as sweatshops , 
brought together sometimes hundreds of workers who were expected to sew at a fast 
pace for long hours to ensure that they kept their jobs and the owners made a decent 
profi t. One could walk for blocks in southern Manhattan and see nothing but such 
Sweatshops 
Small, poorly ventilated shops or apartments 
crammed with workers, often family 
members, who pieced together garments.

In 1906, the Jewish Daily Forward , a Yiddish-language 
newspaper serving Jewish immigrants, began carrying an 
advice column in which the editor, Abraham Cahan responded 
to letters. One writer, a recent immigrant from Russia, said: 
Oh, my poor dear parents, how saddened they were at my 
leaving. The leave-taking, their seeing me on my way, was like 
a silent funeral.…I came to America and became a painter. 
My great love for Hebrew, for Russian, all my other knowledge 
was smeared with paint. During the year that I have 
been here I have had some good periods, but I am not happy 
because I have no interest in anything. My homesickness and 
loneliness darken my life.…I want to run back…and I beg you 
to be my counsel as to how to act. 
The editor was blunt noting that “almost all immigrants yearn 
deeply for dear ones and home at first,” but that the young man 
“must not consider going home, but try to take root here. He 
should try to overcome all these emotions and strive to make 
something of himself so that in time he will be able to bring his 
parents here.” 
That same year, Hamilton Holt, editor of the New York 
Independent, published The Life Stories of Undistinguished 
Americans As Told by Themselves, 27 accounts of the immigrant 
experience including several by those who considered a return 
to their homeland but who had decided against it. An Italian 
immigrant who shined shoes in New York City who wrote: 
We had said that when we saved $1,000 each we would go 
back to Italy and buy a farm, but now that the time is coming 
we are so busy and making so much money that we think we 
will stay. 
A Swedish immigrant who prospered as a farmer in 
Minnesota wrote: 
Father and mother kept writing to the children in America 
that now they had made their fortunes they should come 
home and live, but they put it off.…I am going over to 
Sweden soon to keep Christmas there.…but will come back 
again, and maybe bring other people with us. Some Swedes 
go to the old country every Christmas. 
A modern researcher, Erika Lee, found that her great-greatgreat-
grandfather, Moy Dong Kee, had come to California in 
1854, before the Chinese Exclusion Act limited Chinese mobility. 
Though he stayed in the United States for 52 years, he 
was able to make at least three trips to visit his family who 
remained in China. He finally retired to China in 1906 at the 
age of 72. 
Some immigrants indeed traveled back and forth often. 
Others made their fortunes in America and then returned to 
their homelands. Perhaps a quarter or more of all Italian immigrants 
eventually returned to Italy, an unusually high percentage 
among immigrant communities, but a little money earned 
in America could translate into land ownership in Italy. In other 
immigrant communities—especially among Russian Jews facing 
pogroms and conscription into the czarist army—very few ever 
returned. The pull of nostalgia and the usually stronger push to 
continue to make a life in their new adopted home was part of 
the life of almost every immigrant.

Thinking Critically 
1. Crafting an Argument 
What do the reasons immigrants gave for wanting to leave or 
wanting to stay tell you about their reasons for immigrating 
in the first place? 
2. Contextualization 
Why might some immigrants have found it easier than others 
to return to their home country? Why was such a trip almost 
impossible for others? 
THINKING HISTORICALLY 
The Pull of Nostalgia, the Push to Continue 
work going on from early morning to late evening. In spite—or perhaps because—of 
the harsh living and working conditions, New York’s Jewish community grew strong. 
Russian Jews had no intention of returning to Russia where pogroms and poverty 
reigned. Th ey established synagogues, foreign language newspapers provided news, 
and some 300 Hebrew schools maintained their language and culture. 
Italian immigrants also created their own neighborhoods. In Chicago, Taylor Street 
became the heart of Little Italy. In Milwaukee, the Th ird Ward on the east side was the 
heart of the Italian community where some 20 Italian grocery stores existed on Brady 
Street alone. In Boston, the North End and East Boston housed Italian communities. 
And in New York, many Italian immigrants, like Russian Jewish immigrants, moved 
to the Lower East Side of Manhattan. 17.4

Since most Italian immigrants came from the rural poverty of southern Italy, 
they had few marketable skills when they got to the United States. Like Russian 
Jews, some became pushcart owners, selling fruits and vegetables. Others opened 
restaurants. More than a few became the laborers who built the cities where they 
lived: New York, Chicago, Milwaukee, and Boston all have water and sewer lines 
dug by Italian laborers. Gender roles were, perhaps, more rigidly defined in the 
Italian immigrant communities than elsewhere. Italian families tried every way they 
could to encourage married women to stay at home and to depend on the men to 
earn a living for the family. 
For the 900,000 French Canadians who emigrated to the United States between 
1840 and 1930, the move south meant escape from rural poverty and a chance for a 
new start, especially in the mills of New England. More than most immigrant groups, 
those coming from Quebec tended to bring their priests (nearly all French Canadians 
were Catholic), doctors, lawyers, and grocers with them, all of whom were sure that 
life might be better—or at least marginally more prosperous—in rapidly industrializing 
New York and New England than in the isolated farms of Quebec. 
Like the Italians and the French Canadians, Mexican immigrants often moved 
back and forth between the United States and home communities, but in their case, 
that move meant crossing only a river rather than an ocean. Nevertheless, more and 
more immigrants from Mexico eventually made permanent homes in the United 
States, creating the barrios, which were oft en extensions of Mexican communities that 
had long stretched along the border from Texas to California. 
Mexican-American communities, like those of European immigrants, often 
reflected quite different home regions. One immigrant remembered, “We came 
to know families from Chihuahua, Sonora, Jalisco, and Durango. Some had come 
to the United States even before the revolution, living in Texas before migrating to 
California.” Th e barrio was also home in other ways. Immigrants from Mexico could 
fi nd familiar food, including tamales, frijoles, tortillas, and menudo. Th ey could see 
traditional clothing, enjoy traditional holidays and festivals, and feel much less like 
strangers in someone else’s land. 
For all Catholic immigrants, the Catholic Church was an essential link with their 
faith and their past. At the end of the U.S. Civil War, there were 42 dioceses and 
3,000 Catholic churches in the United States. By 1900, there were 70 dioceses and 
10,000 churches, many serving specifi c ethnic communities. Th e Italian parish, the 
Polish parish, the Mexican parish, and the German parish might be in very close proximity, 
but they served their own group, oft en off ering parochial schools and classes in 
a home language that was important to parents coping with children growing up in an 
English-speaking society. 
Th ose who entered the United States from Asia found diff erent kinds of work in 
their own ethnic communities. Chinese immigrants such as Lee Chew found work 
when they could: 
When I got to San Francisco…[a] man got me work as a house servant in an 
American family, and my start was the same as that of almost all the Chinese 
in this country. Th e Chinese laundryman does not learn his trade in China; 
there are no laundries in China.…All Chinese laundrymen here were taught in 
the fi rst place by American women just as I was taught. 
For the Japanese in Hawaii (an independent country until 1898), housing and work 
were found on the sugar plantations, which were new to them. Hawaiian companies 
encouraged whole families to immigrate, believing that “dependable married men” 
made better workers, though both women and men were given jobs in the fields. 
Japanese communities were able to establish themselves with their own traditions, 
religious practices including Buddhist temples, Japanese-language schools for children, 
and festivals including the Emperor’s Birthday when work ceased in spite of 
the frustration of the plantation owners. In time, Japanese, Portuguese, Chinese, and

CONCLUSION 
Th e well-named Gilded Age was a time of great extremes. In the decades aft er the Civil 
War, Americans built bigger corporations, cities, and buildings than ever before. Some 
made huge fortunes and lived a life of lavish spending. Other Americans created a new 
middle class. Still others, especially immigrants living in tightly packed urban communities, 
lived on the edge of poverty while also creating new cultures with their own 
values and norms. All of them created a vastly diff erent nation than any previous generation 
had known. 
During the Gilded Age, America emerged as an industrial giant. Technological 
innovation and vast reserves of coal, oil, steel, and timber, along with well-established 
but expanding railroad networks, fueled a growing economy. New forms of corporate 
ownership developed to direct and manage large-scale industrial operations, and private 
investment banks grew immensely rich and infl uential along with the industrialists 
whose ventures they helped to fi nance. Th e few who managed to generate great 
wealth oft en spent lavishly on homes and possessions as a refl ection of their power 
and position, sealing the reputation of the period as one of shameless excess gotten by 
ruthless economic exploitation. 
While a few grew enormously wealthy, a new middle class also emerged in 
the Gilded Age. Made up mostly of the families of men who worked at the middle 
levels and managed the large new corporations, the middle class created its 
own new lifestyle. City services—from a healthy supply of water to new high-rise 
buildings with elevators to giant department stores catered to the needs of this 
growing middle class. Many in the middle class also sought some distance from 
the cities, and the rail and trolley lines facilitated the growth of suburbs in which 
large private homes replaced apartments and people enjoyed a mix of urban and 
rural amenities. From religion to sports to politics, the United States catered to 
the new middle class. 
Th e rapidly expanding new industries needed workers, and the call for workers 
exerted a pull on people living in far distant places, including Russia, Italy, China, 
and Japan. At the same time, developments in these and other countries were creating 
a push that led many to want to leave. Whether it was the anti-Jewish pogroms in 
Russia or the grinding poverty of Italy or the civil wars that wracked China, the chance 
to leave for a better life was so appealing that the United States experienced a massive 
era of immigration between 1880 and 1914. Once in the United States, immigrants 
were not always welcomed. Many native-born Americans distrusted what they saw as 
foreign cultures. Many immigrants resisted giving up old ways. But the jobs—though 
low level and low pay—were there and immigrants began working in agriculture and 
in the booming urban sweatshops that were clothing the country and the world. 
As a result of all of these changes, by 1900, the United States was a very diff erent 
place than it had been only a few short decades earlier. 

TECHNOLOGY CHANGES THE NATION 
Explain the inventions of the late 1800s and their impact. 
Summary 
Th e late 1800s were an age of technological innovation. New 
forms of communication technology and new forms of energy 
transformed day-to-day life. In many cases, new technologies 
gave rise to new industries as inventors and their fi nancial backers 
formed companies to market their inventions and develop 
new applications for their use. In the case of the automobile 
industry, the creation of a mass market depended on innovations 
in both technology and methods of production.

CORPORATIONS AND MONOPOLIES 
Analyze the role of the new giant corporations in American life. 
Summary 
Th e development and application of the most important new 
technologies of the late 1800s required resources on a scale that 
only large organizations could provide. It is not a coincidence, 
therefore, that the period saw the rise of new forms of industrial 
corporations and new kinds of industrial fi nancing. Th ese new 
institutions controlled more wealth and wielded more power 
than any previous business organizations. Speculators played 
a major role in the expansion of American industry and commerce, 
sometimes with disastrous consequences for the public 
at large. Industrialists and fi nanciers won unheard of fortunes 
by consolidating their control over entire industries, using 
monopoly power to eliminate competition and increase profi ts.

Analyze daily life, popular ideas, and political direction for the 
middle class during the Gilded Age. 
Summary 
The same era that saw the rise of the super wealthy saw the 
emergence of a new middle class whose values would come 
to dominate American culture. The rising class of professionals 
and managers demanded new levels of material comfort 
and expected to live in cities that mirrored the value they 
placed on cleanliness and orderliness. Many white middle-class 
Protestants saw their own religious views and social values as 
the essence of American culture. In the 1870s and 1880s, most 
Protestants outside of the South and the nation’s corporate leaders 
supported the Republican Party, and the era saw the election 
of a string of largely undistinguished Republican presidents.

in such large numbers during the Gilded Age and what their 
experience was. 
Summary 
Between 1890 and 1914, 15 million immigrants arrived in the 
United States. Unlike previous immigrants who came largely 
from northern Europe, most of the new arrivals were from 
southern Europe, eastern Europe, Asia, and Mexico. A variety 
of forces, including poverty and fear of persecution, pushed 
immigrants to leave their countries of origin. At the same time, 
the pull of opportunity was as important as the push of poverty 
and oppression in bringing new immigrants to America.

When he accepted the nomination of the newly growing Socialist 
Party for president in the 1912 presidential elections, Eugene V. 
Debs said: 
The world’s workers have always been and still are the world’s 
slaves. Th ey have…produced all the world’s wealth and supported 
all the world’s governments. They have conquered all things but 
their own freedom. 
It was the goal of the Socialist Party, Debs said, to win that freedom. Debs 
had an expansive goal for his political organization—a party for women and 
men, blacks and whites, struggling farmers as well as factory and railroad 
workers. When the presidential election was held in November, Debs won 
some 900,000 votes, or 6 percent of the total. Although that percentage 
was small, it reflected nonetheless unusual support for a nontraditional 
candidate. 
In a nation in the midst of rapid social change, Debs sought to speak those being hurt by the changes. Although he failed to rally as many hoped to his political banner, his campaign refl ected the deep tensions in United States in the late 1800s and early 1900s. In the face of extraordinary

CONFLICT IN THE NEW SOUTH 
Analyze how the combined impact of industrialism and the end of Reconstruction created 
the unique character of the New South. 
In 1886, the young editor of the Atlanta Constitution , Henry Grady, was invited to New 
York City to speak at the prestigious New England Society of New York, one of the city’s 
most elite groups. Coming 20 years aft er the end of the Civil War, the invitation was 
quite an honor for a Southern newspaper editor. Th e society, like Grady, was ready for 
a fresh start regarding the nation’s regional diff erences. Grady was in New York to tell 
his audience that a New South had been born. Th e New South was not like the old version. 
It had been born, Grady said, out of the defeat of the South’s “brave armies” in the 
late war and the ending of slavery. A new day had begun. But it had begun under leaders 
who, though moving in new ways, were proud of their past and wanted to be clear, 
“Th e South has nothing for which to apologize.…Th e South has nothing to take back.” 
Th e New South meant several things to Grady. First, Grady was saying that that 
the South was done apologizing for the Civil War, for slavery, and for the increasingly 
rigid social, political, and economic segregation that was developing in place of slavery. 
On race relations, the South, Grady said, wanted to be left alone. Grady was also 
announcing that the South had come of age economically. It was building railroads 
and industrializing at an impressive pace, and Southerners wanted to be fully integrated 
into the economic prosperity of the rest of the nation. On the economic front, 
the New South that Grady was discussing was indeed diff erent from the Old South. 
Economic Development and Economic Optimism 
The pre–Civil War South had been dominated by agriculture. In the New South, 
sawmills, factories, mines, and railroads were being built, and old wooden buildings 
were being replaced with new brick ones in many towns. Optimism was growing, 
though not everyone was celebrating. Th e decline in the price of cotton was devastating 
farmers, and for most African-Americans, segregation and exclusion made life 
almost unbearable. Nevertheless, for a fortunate subset of white Southerners, the years 
between 1875 and 1900 were a time for optimism. 
Before the Civil War, the South had far fewer miles of railroad track than the North. 
Catching up on railroad construction was a key element in defining the New South. 
Th e new railroads brought all sorts of change. Th e investment in building railroads— 
much of it Northern or European money—brought work to many Southerners, not only 
those who did the actual work of laying track but also those supporting them. As one 
Mississippi resident noted, “Th e women and children were busy producing vegetable 
crops, chickens, eggs, milk and butter, and the men were butchering and delivering fresh 
meat and other supplies to the men working on the railroad.” Once the new lines were in 
place, there were also jobs working on the railroads. Th e work was dangerous and injuries 
were common, but the pay was better than anything many Southerners had seen. 
Th e rail lines provided Southerners with important new connections to the outside 
world (see Maps 18-1A and 18-1B ). A generation earlier, rail lines had connected 
many parts of the North, but when the rail lines fi nally reached an isolated town like 
Harrison, Arkansas, in February 1900, the local newspaper announced, “Harrison is 
a Rail-road Town At Last.” Henry Hammond, an astute observer of Southern life, 
pointed out that country people “who formerly were satisfi ed with their weekly paper, 
who went to town annually or semiannually, in some instances not more than two

or three times during a long life, can now go quickly, safely, pleasantly and cheaply 
several times a day.” Farms were connected to towns, and towns to cities beyond the 
imaginings of people’s parents and grandparents. 
Th e railroads that brought people to town also brought goods from around the 
world while shipping goods that the South produced to world markets. Country stores 
sold manufactured goods that made life easier and fertilizer that made the land more 
productive. 
In many small towns, stores also sold goods on credit, making them virtually 
banks. In this capacity, stores also accepted fi elds planted in cotton as collateral for 
loans, as cotton remained the prime cash crop of the South. 
In addition to cotton, new industries were growing in the South in the 1880s. 
Sawmills and turpentine camps produced lumber and turpentine that was shipped 
around the world. Phosphate mining expanded but was then eclipsed by coal mining 
as new markets demanded coal. Tobacco, which the South had shipped to the world 
since the 1600s, became a growth industry. Using eff ective advertising and marketing 
skills, Julian Carr shipped his Bull Durham tobacco bags worldwide, and Washington 
Duke and his son James shipped prerolled cigarettes that quickly became the most 
popular way to enjoy “clean, quick, and potent” tobacco. Iron and steel were produced 
at the South’s fastest growing city of Birmingham. Th e South’s textile production, 
which had involved 10,000 people in 1870 (as it had in 1850), employed almost 
100,000 by 1900. Finally, a new product, Coca-Cola, developed by Asa G. Candler 
in 1889, became highly popular and, eventually, a drink of choice for many on 
every continent. 
Nostalgia and Celebration of the “Lost Cause” 
The rapid changes in the South made some uneasy. The movement of 
Southerners—white and black—in search of jobs and economic opportunities 
created a sense of dislocation. C. L. Pettigrew of North Carolina, like 
many others, remembered a slower pace and complained about “that striving, 
rough and eager crowd.” Others mourned to see “the white-columned 
porticos of the favorite colonial architecture now maundering in decay,” as 
ambitious young people moved to opportunities elsewhere. 
Simmering in the South were deep generational tensions between 
Confederate veterans and those who had been born too late to remember 
the war. A Texas veteran wrote to the legislature, asking them to be sure 
that “the sons of Confederates and the public generally” remember the Lost 
Cause. Another ex-Confederate, Wade Hampton, insisted, “I believe now, 
as always, that the South was right.” For veterans like Hampton and others 
and for Southern widows of those who had died in the war, the memory 
of the “Lost Cause” as a glorious time and a righteous fight made the 
pain of a sometimes lonely and often economically challenging present 
more bearable. 
Southern writers produced romantic stories of the “Lost Cause” of 
the Civil War and the days of slavery that preceded it. Th omas Nelson 
Page, of a prominent Virginia family, created the “plantation school” 
of writing, recounting tales of a chivalrous past. Page also started the 
tradition of the wise and loyal slave, who, Page told his white readers, 
longed for the days before the war when everyone had a secure place in a 
well-ordered society. The most famous author of the plantation school, Joel 
Chandler Harris, created the fi ctional elderly black man, Uncle Remus, and his 
animal alter-ego, Brer Rabbit. The Uncle Remus stories first published in the 
Atlanta Constitution in 1879 and then as a popular book, portrayed the Old South 
as a romantic and happy place. 
This ad from the 1890s introduces the new drink, Coca Cola, 
which was one of the many new industries that emerged in the 
South.

Religion in the New South 
Religion also played a crucial role in the post-Reconstruction South. Southerners 
did not actually attend church in greater numbers than their Northern counterparts, 
but religious imagery and biblical language were a strong part of the South’s culture. 
With the coming of freedom, Southern blacks quickly joined or established their own 
churches. By 1890, there were 1.3 million black Baptists in the South. Northern black 
churches, especially the African Methodist Episcopal and African Methodist Episcopal 
Zion denominations, also built churches for Southern blacks. Th e black church became 
the place in the segregated South where former slaves could meet with a measure of 
safety, share and build and new communal identity, and control the intellectual and 
cultural life of their own institution. 
White Southerners also gravitated to churches in the 1880s and 1890s. Baptist bodies 
were the largest group of white churches in the South, but the Methodists claimed 
almost as many members. Also strong were the Disciples of Christ, the Presbyterians, 
and in certain areas of the South, Episcopalians and Roman Catholics. In white and 
black churches, nearly all of the clergy were male, but women could play a large role in 
the churches, particularly through women’s associations and mission groups, which 
provided necessary support to these churches and through which women could exercise 
a level of autonomy. 
Creating the Segregated South 
The railroads that knit the New South together quickly became the focus of the 
South’s great unresolved issue—race. Even though the political rights of African- 
Americans had been declining in the South since the defeat of Reconstruction 
in the 1870s, the South of the 1880s and early 1890s was not the rigidly segregated 
place it would become by 1900. Churches were segregated by custom and 
choice. Schools, hospitals, and hotels were generally segregated by law. Blacks 
were confined to the balcony in most theaters, and the races did not mix in 
restaurants. However, in many places of work, at many political gatherings, and 
in travel, blacks and whites could be found together in the South of the 
late 1800s. Th e railroads were certainly not going to build separate lines 
or even run separate trains, and most railroads saw all talk of racial 
segregation as potentially troublesome and expensive. Nevertheless, 
trouble was brewing. 
As passenger railroads developed in the South between 1865 and 1880, 
they generally off ered two classes of service—a fi rst-class car for women and 
men who did not smoke or chew tobacco, and a second-class car—oft en a 
section of the baggage car—for men who used tobacco or people too poor to 
buy a fi rst-class ticket. In some cases, blacks were assumed to belong in the 
second-class car with the tobacco-using white men; however, in many cases, 
blacks rode fi rst class without incident. In any case, a trip that might start 
without incident could quickly turn ugly. In the early 1880s, a black man was 
asked by the conductor to leave the fi rst-class car aft er the train crossed the 
state line from Tennessee to Georgia. When he refused, he was badly beaten 
by other passengers. In 1889, a delegation from the first African Baptist 
Church of Savannah, Georgia, started their journey to a church convention 
in Indianapolis, Indiana, on the East Tennessee, Virginia and Georgia 
Railroad. Th e well-dressed delegates started out comfortably in fi rst class, 
but they were met at a subsequent train stop by a mob of 50 white men with 
pistols and clubs who attacked them and threatened to “blow your G-d-d 
brains out.” 
While the railroads did not want to take action, state legislatures 
did. In railroad cars, people of different races—and equally important, 
A conductor evicts a well-dressed black man from a fi rst-class 
coach. Enforcing segregation on the railroad coach was seen 
by many white southerners as somehow essential to protecting 
white women.

genders—might mix in especially close contact given the close seating. During the 
late 1800s, whites were developing an especially great fear of any contact between 
black men and white women. As one person wrote, a man “would be horrified at 
the idea of his wife or daughter seated by the side of a burly negro.” Tennessee 
was the first state to respond, enacting a law saying, “All railroad companies shall 
furnish separate cars, or portions of cars cut off by partition wall, which all colored 
passengers who pay first-class rates of fare may have the privilege to enter and 
occupy.” The law seemed to imply that it was up to blacks whether they wanted 
to be segregated or not, but clearly that idea was not the way the arrangement 
worked. Across the South, trains were rigidly segregated a decade before the 
1896 U.S. Supreme Court’s 7-to-1 decision in Plessy v. Ferguson declared that 
“separate but equal” transportation—and, by implication, other matters—did 
not violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. 
Constitution. 
The Politics of Exclusion 
The end of the racially integrated governments of the Reconstruction era and 
the almost complete exclusion of African-Americans from the political life of the 
South took place in two distinct stages between the 1870s and 1900. These stages 
are often merged in the popular mind as if they happened all at once, though they 
did not. 
The first step in ending Reconstruction took place in the 1860s and 1870s (see 
Chapter 14 ) . Black legislators and white legislators who supported them (all of whom 
were Republicans) were defeated by white Democratic segregationists at different 
times in diff erent states, nearly always in elections marked by violence and voter intimidation. 
Virginia was the fi rst to shift from a Republican to a Democratic legislature in 
1869. Conservative Democrats soon also won large majorities in other states—North 
Carolina in 1870, Georgia in 1871, Texas in 1873, Alabama and Arkansas in 1874, and 
South Carolina and Mississippi in 1876. Finally, contested elections in Louisiana and 
Florida were awarded to the Democrats in 1877 as part of the same compromise that 
put Hayes in the White House. Th e withdrawal of most federal troops that the newly 
inaugurated Hayes ordered in 1877 was thus the culmination, not the cause of the end 
of Reconstruction. 
However, the defeat of Reconstruction was not the end of the story. While 
every Southern state had a conservative Democratic legislature and governor 
after 1877, quite a few blacks still voted and some were still elected and appointed 
to public offices in the South for another decade. Black voters could provide 
the margin of victory in close contests. Most state legislatures had at least a 
few African-American representatives, and many federally appointed officials 
from postmasters to census officials were black. In 1891, as the Arkansas 
legislature was debating railroad segregation, it was a black legislator, John 
Gray Lucas, who objected. It was also a black delegate to Mississippi’s 1895 
state constitutional convention, Thomas E. Miller, who told the majority that 
they needed to remember, “It was your love of power and your arrogance which 
brought Reconstruction on you.” 
In most cases, the few black offi ce holders remaining were too few in number to 
have an impact. Nevertheless, some whites objected to the close interactions that 
challenged racial and gender conventions in certain offi ces such as when a white 
woman visited the post offi ce to be helped by a black male postmaster. When the 
Republicans won the White House and Congress in 1888, some white Southerners 
feared a repeat of Reconstruction, perhaps even the appointment of federal election 
offi cials who would monitor Southern election procedures. At the same time, 
a new generation of Southern whites were tired of the Klan-style violence that

18.1

18.3 
accompanied elections. An1889 article in the Jackson, Mississippi, Clarion-Ledger 
said, “Th e old men of the present generation can’t aff ord to die and leave the election 
to their children and grandchildren, with shot guns in their hands, a lie in their 
mouths and perjury on their lips in order to defeat the negroes.” Th e solution to the 
election violence that the newspaper wanted was not to hold fair and race-neutral 
elections but, rather, to establish legal means to exclude all blacks from all political 
participation. 
Fears of black political involvement grew in the 1890s when the Populist movement 
disrupted Southern politics. It was one thing for a handful of blacks in the state 
legislature to raise questions about a bill before the white majority voted for whatever 
it wanted. It was a diff erent matter if the white Democratic majority was split between 
Populist and traditional factions and the black representatives had the tie-breaking 
votes or if, as happened in North Carolina, a Populist-Republican ticket, with black 
support, could actually win the majority of seats in a state legislature. In 1896, South 
Carolina’s arch-segregationist Governor Ben Tillman warned of an “unholy alliance 
between the independents and the negroes.” 
For many Southern whites, the solution was a new set of laws that would ensure 
“white supremacy” forever. Political leaders called new state constitutional conventions 
to ensure that they secured absolute power. Blacks and their white allies had 
been marginalized by the violence and the voting that ended Reconstruction, but the 
new state constitutions of the 1890s moved from marginalization to complete exclusion. 
When the work of these new constitutional conventions was done, extremely 
few black voters and no black offi ce holders remained anywhere in what came to be 
known as the “solid South,” which meant solidly white and Democratic. 
Mississippi rewrote its state constitution in 1890, creating what looked like colorblind 
obstacles that would, in practice, stop all blacks from voting. Th e most obvious 
restrictions—a literacy test or a poll tax or a property qualifi cation for voters—would 
also exclude many poor whites who were themselves illiterate and who could not meet a 
property qualifi cation or pay a poll tax. So Mississippi’s delegates created a complex set 
of limitations on voting and offi ce. To be able to vote, the new constitution said, a person 
had to have lived in the state for at least 2 years and in the election district for at least 1; 
a sharecropper who moved for a better chance at life thus lost the right to participate in 
elections at least for a time. Other states instituted “grandfather clauses” that said anyone 
whose grandfather had been a voter was exempt from other restrictions, a privilege no 
descendent of slaves could claim. Th ose intending to vote in Mississippi and elsewhere 
could not do so if they had been convicted of petty crimes such as arson, bigamy, or petty 
theft , crimes that blacks were routinely charged with. Ironically, conviction for murder, 
rape, or grand larceny did not exclude one from voting. Th e Mississippi convention did 
require a modest poll tax. Finally, the convention adopted a requirement that every voter 
be able to understand and interpret the state constitution. White state-appointed registrars 
would decide whose interpretation was “reasonable.” An editorial in the Jackson, 
Mississippi, Clarion-Ledger described the new system: “[I]f every negro in Mississippi 
was a graduate of Harvard…he would not be as well fi tted to exercise the right of suff rage 
as the Anglo-Saxon farm laborer.” Once the new Mississippi Constitution took eff ect, it 
had its intended impact. Once other Southern states observed what was happening in 
Mississippi, they too adopted the approach. 
Aft er the U.S. Supreme Court declared poll taxes and literacy tests to be constitutional 
in their 1898 ruling in Williams v. Mississippi, there was little chance that 
any Southern state would fail to enact such Mississippi-style voting tests. In 1908, 
Texas became the last state of the former Confederacy to add a poll tax, and across the 
region, that tax was usually one of several mechanisms that ended black voting. 
Then, as though all of the new laws were not enough, a new form of violence 
toward African-Americans emerged in the late 1800s. Where the Klan and other 
groups had terrorized black communities during Reconstruction, the spectacle of

18.1 
public lynching became widespread in the following years. Individual African- 
Americans, oft en young men, were singled out, oft en accused with little or no evidence 
of raping a white woman, and hung in a public spectacle. Th e issue was rarely 
an actual rape but, more oft en, a young black man’s failure to observe the customs 
of stepping out of the way for a white person to pass or a black man’s challenging 
the payment of a landowner at the sharecroppers settle, or a black man asserting his 
political rights. Most of all, lynching was a way to strike terror into the black community 
while asserting and celebrating white dominance. In 1900, the New South 
was fast becoming a region governed exclusively by white voters and white elected 
offi cials and would remain so until the black Civil Rights movement of the 1950s, 
1960s, and 1970s transformed the region and the nation. 
African-American Responses 
As the rigid segregation of “separate but equal,” which everyone knew meant 
separate and very unequal, settled on the South and, indeed, much of the country, 
especially aft er 1896, African-Americans debated how to respond to a legal system 
that excluded them from voting. In addition, they considered their response 
to being barred from access to quality schooling and to any but the most menial 
jobs as well as to being restricted from entering rail cars, hotels, or theaters that 
served whites. They also argued responses to cultural expectations that they 
“give way,” allowing whites to pass in front of them in stores and on sidewalks, 
that they call all whites by their last names while they were called by their fi rst 
names by whites, and that they live with the oppressive knowledge that even the 
slightest challenge to segregation could be met with not only ostracism but also 
unimaginable violence. 
Ida B. Wells (1862–1931) was one of the African-Americans who challenged 
the lynchings that were a key part of the violence used to maintain segregation. 
Between 1889 and 1918, 386 lynchings took place in Georgia, 373 in Mississippi, 
and similar numbers in several other states. Wells argued that the rape charge, 
which was oft en the excuse for lynching a black man, was a “thread-bare lie” 
and a cover for punishing any black man who challenged the rules of segregation. 
In response to her writing, a white mob destroyed her printing press at 
her Memphis Free Press, but throughout her life, she continued to write, publish, 
and organize legal challenges to segregation and especially its maintenance 
through the violence of lynchings. 
In the face of the harsh reality of segregation and exclusion, Booker T. 
Washington (1856–1915), perhaps the nation’s best-known African-American leader, 
argued that it was time to adjust to segregation rather than challenge the laws and customs 
excluding blacks. Washington urged blacks to create an economic foundation 
for themselves. In the midst of the harsh realities of the 1890s, Washington’s course of 
action seemed the only realistic option. 
Not all African-Americans agreed with Washington, and a young African- 
American scholar, W.E.B. Du Bois (1868–1963), became his harshest critic. Du Bois 
criticized compromises and wrote that “the problem of the twentieth century is the 
problem of the color line.” He described the kind of “double consciousness” or “twoness” 
that African-Americans were forced to develop in a country that proclaimed liberty 
but excluded them by law and custom. 
Ida B. Wells-Barnett became the most eff ective 
national spokesperson for the antilynching crusade.

In 1905, Du Bois joined other African-American leaders meeting at Niagara Falls— 
in a hotel on the Canadian side because no hotel on the American side would give 
them rooms—to begin a campaign for “every single right that belongs to a free-born 
American, political, civil, and social” without compromise. Th e Niagara Movement 
that emerged from the conference fought for an end to segregation and for full equality 
for African-Americans. Four years later, in February 1909, Du Bois, others from

African-American group organized in 1905 to 
promote racial integration, civil and political 
rights, and equal access to economic opportunity; 
the movement later helped organize 
the NAACP.

On September 18, 1895, Booker T. Washington gave a 
speech to a mostly white audience at the Cotton States 
and International Exposition in Atlanta, Georgia. Washington 
came to the exposition at the height of his career to offer what 
came to be known as the Atlanta Compromise —that African- 
Americans would accept segregation in return for being able to 
develop economically. So Washington said: 
To those of my race...I would say: “Cast down your bucket 
where you are”—cast it down in making friends in every 
manly way with the people of all races with whom we are 
surrounded. Cast it down in agriculture, mechanics, in 
commerce, in domestic service, and in the professions. . . . 
In all things that are purely social we can be as separate 
as the fingers, yet one as the hand in all things essential 
to mutual progress. . . .The wisest among my race understand 
that the agitation of questions of social equality is 
the extremist folly, and that progress in the enjoyment of 
all the privileges that will come to us must be the result of 
severe and constant struggle rather than of artificial forcing. 
No race that has anything to contribute to the markets 
of the world is long in any degree ostracized. It is important 
and right that all privileges of the law be ours, but it 
is vastly more important that we be prepared for the exercise 
of these privileges. The opportunity to earn a dollar in 
a factory just now is worth infinitely more than the opportunity 
to spend a dollar in an opera-house. 
At the time, the speech was greeted with great applause, 
most of all, on the part of Northern white philanthropists who 
poured money into Tuskegee and other ventures supported by 
Washington. 
Eight years later in 1903, W.E. B. Du Bois published The Souls of 
Black Folk. Du Bois was unsparing in his judgment, writing: 
Mr. Washington represents in Negro thought the old 
attitude of adjustment and submission . . . …In answer 
to this, it has been claimed that the Negro can survive 
only through submission. Mr. Washington distinctly asks 
that black people give up, at least for the present, three 
things— 
First, political power, 
Second, insistence on civil rights, 
Third, higher education of Negro youth— 
And concentrate all their energies on industrial education, 
the accumulation of wealth, and the conciliation of 
the South. This policy has been courageously and insistently 
advocated for over fifteen years, and has been triumphant 
for perhaps ten years. As a result of this tender of 
the palm-branch, what has been the return? In these years 
there have occurred: 
1. The disfranchisement of the Negro. 
2. The legal creation of a distinct status of civil inferiority 
for the Negro. 
3. The steady withdrawal of aid from institutions for the 
higher training of the Negro. 
These movements are not, to be sure, direct results of Mr. 
Washington’s teachings; but his propaganda has, without 
a shadow of doubt, helped their speedier accomplishment. 
The question then comes: Is it possible, and probable, 
that nine millions of men can make effective progress 
in economic lines if they are deprived of political rights, 
made a servile caste, and allowed only the most meager 
chance for developing their exceptional men? 
Considering these quotes, the lines between Du Bois and 
Washington could not have been starker. In reality, they were 
not as stark as the two documents imply. Privately, Washington 
provided funds for court challenges of segregation and challenged 
lynchings, but unlike Du Bois, he had been born in slavery 
and lived and worked in Alabama in the heart of a segregated 
world. Du Bois, a generation younger, was raised in the North, 
and had much less patience with any form of accommodation. 
Nevertheless, between them, the two leaders outlined differences 
that remained in the African-American community for decades.

THE POLITICS OF CONFLICT—FROM POPULIST MOVEMENT TO 
POPULIST PARTY 
Analyze how agrarian unrest and protest came to have a significant impact on 
American politics. 
In the 1870s and 1880s, American farmers were living very diffi cult lives. Th e work 
was backbreaking. Th ey had no time for much of an education and far too little time 
for family or community life. Th e economic cycles seemed structured against them. 
Whenever farmers started to get ahead fi nancially, they faced a downturn because of 
a glut of wheat in Russia or overproduction of cotton in Egypt or some other issue, 
leaving them in a pattern of debt. Even in good times, it seemed that the railroads and 
middlemen in New York or New Orleans or London or Paris took the profi ts that they 
produced. Perhaps most galling to many farmers was the sense that the rapid changes 
happening in the rest of the country seemed to be leaving them behind. It is not accidental 
that the derogatory word “hayseed,” entered the nation’s vocabulary at this time. 
Urban American saw itself as up to date and modern but saw farmers, living in isolated 
rural areas, as backward and out of date. Moreover, the new technologies that enabled 
rapid communication let these farmers know just what others in the country thought 
of them. Jeff erson’s agrarian ideal seemed like part of a very dim past. 
The Farmers’ Alliance and Other Farm Groups 
By the beginning of the 1880s, many farmers were deeply in debt to the banks on which 
they depended for their mortgages and for loans to obtain equipment and supplies for 
the planting year. Railroads, that might give a break to John D. Rockefeller’s Standard 
Oil, kept raising the rates to haul farm products to market. By the time farmers paid off 
their loans and paid to get the wheat, corn, and other farm products to market, they had 
little, if any, money left . Eventually, farmers started to do something to change their circumstances. 
Nelson Dunning of the Farmers’ Alliance, wrote, “Nothing could withstand 
their power, if the farmers of America would organize,” particularly, as he believed, in 
ways the Standard Oil Company had done. In the Farmers’ Alliance and eventually in 
their own political party, farmers, who had indeed been observing what the Rockefellers 
and Carnegies of the nation were doing, tried to create their own power base. 
The earliest nationwide farmer organization was the Patrons of Husbandry, also 
known as “ the Grange .” Farmers gathered in Grange Halls to celebrate their work and 
foster a sense of community, but they also organized to deal with the chronic debt and 
the sense that the nation’s fi nancial arrangements were stacked against them. Especially in 
the South, local Grange chapters organized cooperative buying and selling through their 
own cotton gins and warehouses, knowing that they would get better prices for their crops

The Grange, the fi rst national farmers’ organization, painted an idealized picture of farming. Later, farmers’ 
organizations were less idealistic and more militant. 
and better rates from the railroads if they banded together. Th e national leadership of the 
Grange focused on lobbying for agricultural colleges, attracting more people to farming, 
encouraging crop diversity, and promoting a richer home life for farm families. 
Farmers also started additional organizations. In 1882, Arkansas farmers launched 
the Agricultural Wheel . By 1885, the Agricultural Wheel had 1,105 local chapters in 
four states. Th e Wheel became a tough organization that excluded any but working 
farmers. Th e organization used its size to negotiate price reductions with manufacturers 
of farm implements and got up to 50 percent reductions on the prices of wagons, 
buggies, reapers, and mowers, while organizing its own warehouses to hold crops 
until prices met expectations. 
A number of similar organizations coordinated similar efforts, but the largest 
by far was the Farmers’ Alliance , which began as the Texas Alliance in Lampasas 
County, Texas, in the 1870s by ranchers who were dealing with issues of communal 
and private grazing lands. Aft er Charles W. Macune was elected president of the Texas 
organization in 1886, the Alliance grew rapidly. Macune had trained as a pharmacist 
and a physician before he settled in Milam County Texas in 1879 where he practiced 
medicine while farming on the side. But his rural medical practice gave him a sense 
of the problems the ranchers and the farmers faced, particularly, the isolation and the 
lack of economic clout.

18.3 
Under Macune’s leadership the Farmers’ Alliance became a business 
organization—organizing the farmers (including ranchers) of Texas, and eventually 
the nation, to use the best of corporate practices to fi ght with the organizations they 
saw oppressing them. Th e Alliance sought to get a better fi nancial deal for farmers 
through the negotiating power of a large organization demanding lower prices for the 
things they bought and higher prices for the products they sold. 
Th e Texas Farmers’ Alliance grew from 38,000 members in 1886 to 225,000 members 
in 1889—almost half of all of the eligible farmers in Texas. In 1887, the Alliance 
merged with the Arkansas-based Agricultural Wheel and continued to grow with local 
units stretching from North Carolina to California and from Texas to the Dakotas. In 
1890, Macune moved to a national headquarters in Washington, DC, and the Alliance 
had over 1 million members. 
Under Macune’s leadership, the Farmers’ Alliance steered clear of direct political 
involvement. Th e goal of the Alliance was simple: farmers would combine their power 
to equal the power of other businesses. Th ey were not opposed to monopolies; they 
wanted to be one. Th e Washington offi ce published the National Economist , mailed to 
farmers across the country, while sponsoring lecturers, organizers, and corresponding 
secretaries to spread Alliance ideas. Th e organization sought to overcome rural isolation 
and lack of educational opportunities through lending libraries, schools, conferences, 
and social occasions for farm families. Most of all, the Alliance sought to open a 
“new era” of prosperity for farmers through tough negotiations on their behalf. 
Macune believed that whites and blacks had diff erent economic interests and 
insisted that the Farmers’ Alliance should include only white farmers. When 
the Agricultural Wheel joined the Alliance, it dropped its black members. In 
response to Macune’s segregationist policy, African-American farmers created 
their own Colored Farmers’ National Alliance and Cooperative Union that 
had 1.2 million members by 1890. Given the political and social disenfranchisement 
that black farmers faced, they organized primarily through black churches. 
In many communities, the black Baptist Church and the Colored Farmers’ Alliance 
had virtually the same membership. Lacking the resources to publish their own 
materials or hire lecturers or organizers, the black organization never had the clout 
of the white alliance, even though it had more members. 
While the Farmers’ Alliance was racially segregated, it welcomed women as members 
and leaders, as did the Colored Farmers’ Alliance. Fully a quarter of the members 
of the Colored Farmers’ Alliance were women. In contrast to the Grange, which 
had special positions for women, the Farmers’ Alliance opened all positions to both 
women and men. Annie L. Diggs of Kansas was one of the senior editors of the 
National Reform Press Association, the white Alliance’s publishing house. Mary E. 
Lease of Kansas was the most famous of the Alliance’s many speakers, while Marion 
Todd of Illinois was considered to be the most eff ective theoretician for the movement. 
Bettie Munn Gay who had turned a highly mortgaged Texas farm into a successful cotton 
growing operation became one of the leaders in the Texas Alliance. Women and 
men within the Alliance debated women’s suff rage and occasionally argued over the 
prohibition of alcohol. But they were united in a commitment to improve the life of 
farm families, economically as well as intellectually and culturally, ending the terrible 
isolation that farm families experienced. 
Colored Farmers’ National Alliance and 
Cooperative Union 
An organization of Southern black farmers 
formed in Texas in 1886 in response to the 
Southern Farmers’ Alliance, which did not 
accept black people as members. It helped 
launch the Populist Party.

While Macune focused the Farmers’ Alliance on cooperative economic eff orts and 
stayed out of electoral politics, other leaders wanted more direct political involvement. 
In California, the president of the state Farmers’ Alliance, Marion Cannon, became 
convinced aft er long battles with the Southern Pacifi c Railroad that only public ownership 
of the railroads would allow farmers to get a fair deal. Alliance lecturer Marion 
Todd published Railways of Europe and America in 1893 in which she argued for

Mary E. Lease, a well-known speaker for the Farmers’ Alliance, 
rose to national fame telling Kansas farmers to “raise less corn 
and more hell” and then traveling the nation to recruit members 
and build support for the organization. In 1891, she gave a speech 
to the National Council of Women of the United States, part of 
which is presented here. 
Madam President, Friends, and Fellow-Citizens,—I use that 
term with somewhat pardonable pride when I remember that 
the Alliance League of Kansas has given to the women of my 
sunflower, humanity-loving, temperance-loving State of Kansas 
the right of political suffrage. 
The subject assigned to me to-day, Women in the Farmers’ 
Alliance, cannot be intelligently discussed nor fully understood 
until the necessity for the formation of the Farmers’ Alliance is 
first shown, and its aims and purposes briefly stated. It must be 
evident to every intelligent man and woman to-day that there is 
something radically wrong in the affairs of this Nation. . . . 
My friends, the lash of the slave-driver’s whip is no longer heard 
in this country, but the lash of necessity is driving thousands to 
unrequited toil. Conscienceless capital is robbing manhood of 
its prime, mothers of their motherhood, and sorrowful children 
of sunshine and of joy. Look around you! What do you behold 
to-day? A land which less than four hundred years ago we received 
fresh from the hands of God, a continent of unparalleled fertility. . . 
and yet, in this land of plenty and unlimited resources, the cry of 
humanity is going up from every corner of this Nation. The plaint 
of motherhood, the moans of starving children! Capital buys and 
sells to-day the very heart-beats of humanity. . . . 
Oh, yes; we can point to the rivers bridged, to the 
transcontinental railway connecting ocean with ocean, to 
wonderful churches and cathedrals; he can point to the most 
wonderful system of agriculture that ever brought joy to a 
hungry world; he can jostle his rags against the silken garments 
his toil has secured; he can walk shelterless and sad by the side 
of the home he has helped to build; he can wipe the sweat 
from his weary face, and reflect that the twenty thousand of 
American millionaires who own one billion five hundred million 
dollars, gathered from the toils and tears of sixty-four millions of 
American people, have it in their power to name their Governors 
and our legislators and representatives and Congressmen,— 
and they do name them, and they have named them for the last 
quarter of a century, and they have it in their power to fix the 
price of labor, to fix the price for every ton of coal.

a government takeover was the only answer. 
Even Macune came to advocate for what he called the subtreasury system , a unit 
he wanted to have created within the U.S. Department of the Treasury that would provide 
low-interest loans to farmers. Th ese loans would be secured by cotton, wheat, and 
other staple crops. Th e subtreasury would protect its investment and support farmers 
through a federal system of warehouses and grain elevators in 1,000 counties across 
the country where the government would ensure minimum prices for crops and 
hold them until they sold at that price. If speculators could use the telegraph to make 
money buying and selling crop futures, why couldn’t farmers, with the right government 
support, use the same technical arrangements to ensure their own profi ts? 
Although Alliance leaders took up the subtreasury idea and some politicians, like 
Tom Watson of Georgia, became advocates, the leadership of the Democratic Party 
resisted, as did virtually all Republicans. In the end, the subtreasury was never created. As 
a result, many within the Alliance began to question the value of staying out of politics.

More than public ownership of railroads or the subtreasury idea, the political issue 
that engaged U.S. farmers was federal fiscal policy. When the government limited 
the supply of currency, farmers had a very diffi cult time paying their debts, getting 
loans, or getting the price they wanted for their crops. When the government made 
more funds available, the resulting infl ation made it easier to pay debts (because the 
debt amounted to less in current dollars) and made it easier to sell the products of the 
farms. Although easing the supply of money improved the situation of farmers, one 
policy made it diffi cult to do: the nation’s adherence to the gold standard, requiring 
that every dollar in circulation be backed by a dollar’s worth of gold in a bank vault. 
During the Civil War, the federal government had temporarily dropped the gold 
standard. Instead, it created federal bank notes, known as “greenbacks” because of 
their color, essentially printing dollars based not on gold but on the “full faith and 
credit” of the government’s promise to pay. Th e government also allowed the additional 
use of silver as backing for currency during the war. Both of these policies eased 
the supply of money signifi cantly, but they also fueled infl ation since, with more dollars 
available, any dollar was worth less. Farmers liked infl ation, but investors and 
bankers hated it. Aft er the Civil War, the nation’s bankers demanded a return to the 
gold standard by gradually withdrawing greenbacks from circulation as the government 
paid down its Civil War debt and then in 1873 “demonetizing” silver so only 
gold, and not silver, could be used for coins or backing for dollars in circulation. Th ese 
policies were eff ective in curbing infl ation, but they led to an extremely tight money 
supply, tight credit, and challenging times for farmers. Th e tight money of the 1880s 
was thus a direct result of federal policy, and the Farmers’ Alliance as well as the other 
farmer organizations were determined to change the policy. Some advocated expanding 
the number of greenbacks, others supported the coinage of more silver and some 
called for both, but all agreed that something needed to be done. 
Populism Becomes a Political Party 
Th e rapid growth of the Farmers’ Alliance in the 1880s brought into the organization 
many state leaders who advocated direct political involvement. Leonidas L. Polk of 
North Carolina was the strongest of all these leaders. A Confederate hero, Polk made 
his fortune in real estate development when the Carolina Central Railroad crossed 
his old family plantation in 1873. He was active in the Methodist Church and in the 
Grange. He also helped ensure the end of Reconstruction in his state while helping recreate 
the Democratic Party there. Polk lobbied for the creation of a state Department 
of Agriculture, became its fi rst commissioner in 1877, and in 1886, published his own 
newspaper, Progressive Farmer . In 1888, he brought the state organization he led into 
the Farmers’ Alliance, and within the year, 42,000 North Carolina farmers were members 
of the national organization. 
Other states had similar leaders. South Carolina’s Benjamin R. Tillman had served 
in a militia that kept blacks and Republicans out of politics. He became active in the 
state Grange in the 1880s and became convinced that “the yoke of the credit system” 
was keeping farmers down. He convened a large meeting of white farmers in 1886, 
lobbied for a state agricultural college, and created a 20,000 member South Carolina 
Alliance that remained independent of the national organization. Georgia’s Tom 
Watson was a lawyer and “friend and follower” of the Farmers’ Alliance, though as a 
nonfarmer he could not join. Nevertheless, he was elected to Congress as a Farmers’ 
Alliance candidate in 1890, expanding the movement of the Alliance into politics. 
As the price of cotton fell to the lowest level in 30 years in 1891—and the farm 
economy continued to worsen in throughout the 1890s—Watson, Tillman, Polk, and 
others rallied for a change. Th e nation’s largest labor union, the Knights of Labor and 
the Women’s Christian Temperance Union had recently launched a new political 
organization, the People’s Party , also known as the Populist Party , at a convention 
in Cincinnati in 1891 that was advocating for many of the reforms to currency and 
People’s Party

third party of the 1890s formed to fight for 
the rights of working people.

regulation of railroads that the Alliance was wanting. If the Farmers’ Alliance were to 
merge with the People’s Party, they could win elections and have their voices heard in 
state capitals, in Congress, perhaps even the White House. 
Macune continued to oppose such political involvement, preferring farmercontrolled 
cooperative economic development. Polk became the leader of those 
who said yes to political involvement and specifi cally to joining the People’s Party. 
Everyone knew that the 1892 convention of the Farmers’ Alliance would decide 
the issue. Polk won. Macune retired from the Alliance and spent the next 30 years 
practicing medicine and law while preaching in Methodist churches in rural Texas. 
Th e People’s (or Populist) Party grew dramatically. Th e Colored Farmers’ Alliance 
and smaller groups like the Farmers’ Mutual Benefit Association also joined. The 
widespread assumption was that when the People’s Party, now a multiracial coalition 
of farmers, labor, and women’s groups, held their national convention in Omaha, 
Nebraska, in July 1892, they would nominate Leonidas Polk for president. A month 
before the convention, however, Polk suddenly died. Th e People’s Party nominated 
James B. Weaver of Iowa, a former Union general, and James G. Field, a former 
Confederate from Virginia, as his running mate. Polk’s charisma did not adhere to 
the new nominees. Nevertheless, Weaver won over a million votes in the 1892 presidential 
election that ultimately returned Cleveland to the White House. Not since 
the late 1850s, when the Republican Party had come out of nowhere, had the nation 
witnessed anything like the phenomenal growth of the Populists, as the members of 
the People’s Party quickly came to be known. Populist candidates won the governor’s 
offi ce in Colorado and Kansas in the 1892 elections. Populists elected Marion Cannon 
to Congress from southern California as well as Congressmen from Colorado, Kansas, 
Nebraska, and North Carolina. Th ey elected eight representatives to the California 
state legislature, a group that held the balance between the Democrats and Republicans 
and almost succeeded in electing California’s U.S. Senator. 
Two years later, Populist candidates won over 1.5 million votes, electing seven to 
the U.S. House, six to the U.S. Senate, and many to state legislatures. In a partnership 
with Republicans, Populists won control of the North Carolina legislature—the only 
time since Reconstruction when the Democrats had lost control of a state—and sent 
Marion Butler to the U.S. Senate. In 1894, Populist candidates won 41 percent of the 
vote for statewide offi ces in Colorado, 39 percent in Washington State, 39 percent in 
Kansas and 36 percent in Texas. Populists were elected to Congress from Alabama, 
Kansas, Nebraska, and North Carolina. Th e Populists, it seemed, were gaining power. 
As the Populists approached the 1896 presidential elections, the Republican and 
Democratic Parties were keeping a worried eye on them and, at the same time, borrowing 
parts of their message. No one borrowed more from the Populists than the 
young former congressman from Nebraska, William Jennings Bryan. Bryan was a 
Democrat, not a Populist, but his views on many issues, most of all his advocacy for 
the unlimited coinage of silver, were the same as those of the Populists and anathema 
to leaders of the Democratic Party, including President Cleveland who was not 
seeking reelection but who wanted a successor more like himself. Nevertheless, Bryan 
worked tirelessly for the Democratic nomination, courting as many “silver” delegates 
to the party’s 1896 convention in Chicago as possible. 
When the Democrats finally met in early July, the debate on the platform was 
intense, pitting those who wanted to hold to the gold standard against the “free silver” 
Democrats who agreed with the Populists. Bryan spoke to the convention, electrifying 
the gathering as he concluded: 
If they dare to come out in the open fi eld and defend the gold standard as a good 
thing, we shall fi ght them to the uttermost, having behind us the producing masses 
of the nation and the world. Having behind us the commercial interests and the 
laboring interests and all the toiling masses, we shall answer their demands for a 
gold standard by saying to them, you shall not press down upon the brow of labor 
this crown of thorns. You shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold.

After the cheering stopped, the Democrats not only adopted a silver 
platform but also nominated Bryan for president. Th e Populists were torn 
about what to do since Bryan’s views seemed so close to their own, and 
with him, they might actually win the White House. Although divided 
between those who wanted to maintain their independence and those who 
were willing to compromise, the Populist Convention that met in July 
nominated Bryan as their candidate for president. By joining forces with 
the Democrats, they were confi dent of victory. 
The Republicans nominated William McKinley, a genial Congressman 
from Ohio, and the last Civil War veteran to run for president. In the fall 
campaign, managed by Marcus Alonzo Hanna, a wealthy supporter who was 
emerging as something close to a modern professional political advisor, the 
Republicans equated a vote for Bryan with a rebellion against the nation. Th ey 
linked the Republican ticket with the fl ag, patriotism, and economic caution. 
Th ey called McKinley the “advance agent of prosperity” and some, like a young 
Theodore Roosevelt, described the Democrats and Populists as “plotting a 
social revolution and the subversion of the American Republic.” In the contest, 
the notions of patriotism, economic caution, and northeast regional distrust of 
the South and West won. A comfortable majority elected McKinley, though the 
results show how deeply divided the country had become (see Map 18-2 ). 
Th e Populists never recovered from their loss in 1896. Th ose who had 
supported Bryan and the alliance with the Democratic Party blamed those 
who did not. Populists who had not wanted to compromise blamed those 
who had “sold out” and supported a Democrat. African-Americans whose 
votes had been essential to Populist victories in many close contests, were 
deeply disillusioned at how quickly Populist leaders like Tom Watson 
turned into arch segregationists aft er 1897. 
Th e Populist Party continued for a short time, but the enthusiasm and confi dence were 
destroyed by the divisions over the 1896 election. In 1900 and 1904, the party nominated 
Tom Watson who, having courted black voters in the 1890s, now campaigned on a platform 
of white supremacy even while he maintained the Populist economic program. Th e 
Democrats renominated Bryan in 1900, but he did poorly without Populist support and 
in the face of prosperity and McKinley’s considerable popularity. Th e new Socialist Party, 
emerging from Northern labor unions, began to contest presidential elections, taking many 
of the Populists labor union supporters. A moment and a movement had passed, although its 
eff orts did, in the end, lead to the adoption of the silver standard. In the early 1900s, national 
interest turned elsewhere, although many elements of the Populist platform were adopted 
and became the basis for a later progressive movement championed by both Republicans and 
Democrats aft er 1900. Th e farmers of the South and West, who had organizing themselves 
so successfully and had bridged heretofore uncrossed gender barriers, were never able to 
resolve their racial divisions. Never again would they have the same level of political power.

traffi c on the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad had come to a halt. Th e management then 
fi red the strikers. In response, others joined the strike, and by July 19, rail workers prevented 
all freight from leaving Pittsburgh. Now mostly forgotten, the strike inspired 
some Americans, frightened others, and for decades shaped people’s responses to the 
country’s rapid growth and industrialization. 
Th e strike was marked by widespread violence. A large crowd of strikers and their 
supporters in Baltimore attacked state militia troops who then fi red on the crowd, killing 
11 people. In Pittsburgh, a huge crowd hurled insults and rocks at a militia unit 
who then started shooting, killing 20. Th e crowd vented its fury on the Pennsylvania 
Railroad, burning everything in sight. By July 22, some 39 Pennsylvania Railroad 
buildings, 104 engines, and more than 1,200 freight cars had been destroyed. As news 
of the violence spread, strikes took place all along the major rail lines from New York 
and New Jersey to Indiana and Illinois. Black and white workers went out on strike 
together. In St. Louis, Missouri, a week-long general strike led workers to take control 
of the city. Workers went on strike as far away as Kansas City and San Francisco. 
Women played a crucial role, and the Baltimore Sun reported about the “very 
active part taken by the women, who are the wives and mothers of the fi remen. Th ey 
look famished and wild, and declare for starvation rather than have their people work 
for the reduced wages.” 
In response to a plea from the railroad management, President Hayes declared that 
a state of insurrection existed and called out federal troops who, armed with rapid-fi re 
Gatling guns, put an end to the strike. Former President Grant criticized his successor, 
noting the irony that he himself had been criticized for sending the army to protect 
black voting rights but, “Now, however, there is no hesitation about exhausting the 
whole power of the government to suppress a strike on the slightest intimation that 
danger threatens.” But in the eyes of the new president, attacks on black voters and 
attacks on the property of the railroad companies were two diff erent things. 
Others drew their own lessons from the 1877 uprising. E. L. Godkin, editor of Th e Nation, 
called for doubling the size of the U.S. Army, but instead something new was created, the 
National Guard, made up of part-time soldiers who could be called out when needed. Aft er 
1877, states created National Guard units and built massive National Guard armories, stern 
stone buildings where arms might be stored in case of a new insurrection. Th ese National 
Guard armories can still be seen in many cities—a monument to the 1877 rail strike. 
Twisted track and the wheels of burned out rail cars show some of the $10 million damage caused by the 
1877 railroad strike.

The strikes also inspired the rise of labor unions that sought to help workers organize to 
demand new rights rather than just vent their fury. Th ese unions sometimes led to additional 
uprisings, but in addition, they brought about changes in how corporations did business. 
The Knights of Labor 
Founded by tailors in Philadelphia in 1869, the Knights of Labor , quickly emerged to 
become the country’s largest and most powerful labor union aft er the 1877 strike. Th e 
Knights welcomed white and black workers, immigrants as well as the native-born, 
and skilled and unskilled workers. Terence V. Powderly was the head, or Grand Master 
Workman, of the Knights of Labor in the 1870s and 1880s. Powderly believed that 
isolated workers and small local unions were doomed to defeat when facing railroads 
and other large corporations, and he wanted his union to have the same organizational 
power as the largest corporations. 
Under Powderly’s leadership, the Knights tried to avoid violence. The Knights 
believed that workers and owners had more in common than their diff erences and 
hoped that eventually many workers could become independent owners rather than a 
permanent labor force. Th e union campaigned for government support of agricultural 
cooperatives, an 8-hour work day, equal pay for women, and government ownership 
of railroads and banks. Powderly took the commitment to racial integration seriously. 
At their October 1886 convention in Richmond, Virginia, Powderly caused quite a stir 
in the local community by inviting an African-American delegate, Francis Ferrell, to 
introduce him to the meeting. In 1883, they organized a successful strike against the 
Western Union Telegraph Company and, in 1885, were strong enough to win a strike 
against several railroads that agreed to restore lost wages and hire back all striking 
workers. For Powderly, the success of the 1885 strike showed what a strong union 
could do. By 1886, the Knights had 700,000 members. In an even larger railroad strike 
that began in Marshall, Texas, in 1886, some 9,000 workers stopped freight on lines in 
Texas, Missouri, Arkansas, and Kansas. Strikes, it seemed, were becoming a national 
phenomenon, and the Knights were in the forefront. However, while national leaders 
of the Knights urged peaceful negotiations, in the 1886 strike, strikers pushed rail 
cars off tracks and set fi res to railroad buildings. To avoid further violence, the Knights 
called off the strike while claiming a victory that was not really theirs. 
Th e railroad strike of 1886 showed the power of a union to bring the trains, and 
thus the country, to a halt. It also demonstrated the split between many members of the 
Knights who harbored deep hatred for industrial owners and union leadership that still 
sought conciliation. While the Knights remained strong and were an essential element 
in the Populist political campaigns of the 1890s, the split was never fully healed. In time, 
other unions, some more moderate, some more radical, would replace the Knights. 
The American Federation of Labor 
While the Knights of Labor attempted to organize all workers, those in some of the more 
skilled trades created their own separate unions. In 1886, many of these small elite unions 
came together to create the American Federation of Labor with 50,000 members. 
Samuel Gompers of the Cigar Makers Union was elected as its president and, except for 
1 year, served as president of the A. F. of L. until his death in 1924, by which time it had 
grown to 3 million members, by far the strongest labor union in the United States. 
Under Gompers’s leadership, the A.F. of L. continued to organize workers in separate 
craft unions with membership in each union restricted to workers in a specifi c trade such 
as cigar makers or plumbers or iron molders. Gompers carefully avoided larger issues, 
preferring to negotiate specifi cally for immediate ends—increased wages, job security, an 
8-hour day, benefi ts, and the right of the union to bargain collectively for workers. “We 
fi ght only for immediate objects. . .that can be realized in a few years,” Gompers said. 
He was happy to leave political ideology and more far-reaching social change to others. 
If the growth in the A. F. of L.’s membership is a measure, it was a successful strategy.

Haymarket, 1886 
On May 4, 1886, many of the tensions in the United States exploded at Chicago’s 
Haymarket Square. Between 40,000 and 60,000 of Chicago’s workers went on strike 
on Saturday, May 1, chanting their demands for an 8-hour work day, “eight hours for 
work, eight hours for rest, eight hours for what we will.” Th e A. F. of L. supported the 
strike. So did socialists and anarchists in Chicago’s diverse immigrant communities. 
Socialism and anarchism, though quite diff erent political philosophies, were both 
very strong in Chicago. Socialists believed that the workers should own the means of 
production and that private ownership of factories, businesses, and lands should be 
abolished in favor of ownership by all, which often meant government ownership. 
Anarchists deeply distrusted any government—including a Socialist government—and 
disdained elections as fraudulent exercises in futility. In place of government, anarchists 
wanted small, local, voluntary organizations. Th ey believed that by abolishing higher 
authorities, a new era of peace and freedom would come. Nevertheless, for two anarchist 
leaders, Albert Parsons and August Spies, the 8-hour movement was an opportunity 
to bring skilled and unskilled workers together as a step toward their larger goal. 
As the strike continued on Monday, May 3, Spies issued a call for a mass meeting 
to be held the following night at Haymarket Square and asked Albert Parsons to join 
him. Perhaps 3,000 people showed up at the Haymarket rally. But just as the rally was 
ending and Parsons himself was enjoying a beer at a nearby tavern, a police contingent 
marched into the rally to end it. Someone—no one ever found out who—threw 
a bomb into the middle of the police ranks, killing one police offi cer. Six more offi cers 
soon died of their wounds. 
As news of the Haymarket bomb spread, newspapers blamed anarchists and socialists 
for the violence. Eventually, Albert Parsons, August Spies, and six others were tried 
and convicted for being part of “a general conspiracy to annihilate the police force and 
destroy property,” even though none of them could possibly have thrown the actual 
bomb. Appeals and a nationwide campaign for clemency ensued. Samuel Gompers, 
who certainly disagreed with anarchists, nevertheless said that Parsons, Spies, and the 
others had been “fi ghting for labor from diff erent sides of the house.” In spite of all the 
appeals, four, including Parsons and Spies, were hung on November 11, 1887. 
Haymarket —as the strike, rally, bombing, and executions all came to be called— 
was a pivotal moment in American labor history. For some, the trial and executions 
were a validation of the rule of law. For others, the trial and execution of men who 
never threw the bomb and did not have any known links to whoever did, provided 
proof that justice was not possible for those who protested in Gilded Age America. 
Lucy Parsons, Albert’s widow, spent the rest of her long life speaking and writing 
about their cause. Emma Goldman, a young girl at the time, traced her own career as a 
life-long radical organizer to the stories of the Haymarket martyrs. 
Homestead Strike, 1892 
While the 1886 strike for an 8 hour-day was a national event, other strikes followed, 
none more important than the 1892 Homestead Strike at Andrew Carnegie’s plant at 
Homestead, Pennsylvania. By the 1890s, Carnegie owned a dozen plants in western 
Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Workers at these huge mills turned out 
a quarter of the nation’s steel supply and earned $40 million per year in profi ts for 
Carnegie. Carnegie wanted to be seen as a friend to working people, but profi ts still 
came fi rst. In 1892, when workers at Carnegie’s Homestead Steel Mill went on strike, 
Carnegie left his top lieutenant, Henry Clay Frick, in charge while he remained at his 
castle in Scotland. Frick decided that the time had come to break the 24,000-member 
Amalgamated Association of Iron, Steel, and Tin Workers. 
In June 1892, when it came time to negotiate a new contract, Frick off ered only a 
cut in salary. When the union rejected the off er, Frick closed the plant, fi red all of the 
workers, and built an 8-foot fence around it. He then hired new nonunion workers

and 300 Pinkerton agents to protect them. Th e Pinkerton Agency had been created to 
support the North during the Civil War but turned into a quasi-police force for industrial 
owners who were caught in confl ict with unions in the late 1800s. Th e Homestead 
workers fought back. 
On July 6 when two barges of Pinkerton detectives came down the river to the 
plant, strikers who had been patrolling the area rushed the pier. No one knows who 
shot fi rst, but both sides kept shooting. Eventually, between fi ve and nine steelworkers 
and between three and ten Pinkerton agents were killed. Pennsylvania’s governor sent 
8,000 militia troops to Homestead to keep the peace, and Frick brought in new workers 
who began operating the mill. Union leaders were arrested, but were acquitted (it 
was hard to fi nd an antiunion jury in the region). Public opinion generally blamed 
Carnegie and Frick for the bloodshed. Nevertheless, Frick had won his battle. He had 
defeated the union and reopened the mills with nonunion workers. Unlike Andrew 
Carnegie, he did not care about public opinion. Carnegie also blamed Frick for the 
troubles, and the two never spoke again, but Carnegie also did not reinstate the union. 
Coxey’s Army, 1893–94 
In 1893, a grand world’s fair, the Columbian Exposition, opened in Chicago. Like earlier 
fairs, this one displayed the nation’s technological marvels and industrial success, including 
400 buildings lit with 10,000 electric lights. While the fair was a booming success, the 
nation’s economy was collapsing in the Panic of 1893. J. P. Morgan rescued the country’s 
gold reserves (see Chapter 17 ) but did not end the terrible unemployment. By the end of 
the year, one-fi ft h of those who had been working before the panic were out of a job. Many 
were desperate, and the contrast between the desperation and the fair’s glitter was obvious. 
An Ohio businessman, Jacob Coxey, was dazzled when he attended the Chicago fair, 
but deeply touched by the poverty and desperation he saw among unemployed in the city. 
Back in his hometown of Massillon, Ohio, near Akron, Coxey announced a plan to put 
the unemployed to work building roads. Coxey argued that America needed to improve 
its mostly dirt roads and also end unemployment. Th e solution was clear to him. Congress 
should appropriate $500 million in government bonds and off er every man who wanted 
to work $1.50 per day for an 8-hour day fi xing the country’s highways. (Coxey assumed 
that the key was putting men, not necessarily women, to work.) And, Coxey insisted, if 
Congress did not act, the unemployed should march to Washington and demand action. 
Although only about 100 marchers assembled at the beginning of the march, by 
the time the march got to Homestead, Pennsylvania, site of the Carnegie strike, it had 
grown to 600. All along the way, people gave them food and shelter. Coxey marched into 
Washington, DC, on schedule on May 1, 1894. Th e New York Times called the march a 
“Battle between Law and Anarchy.” Federal troops were put on alert. By mid-May, some 
800 Coxeyites were in the District of Columbia, a number that grew to 1,200 in August. 
But Congress, dominated as it was by the corporate interests, did not pass Coxey’s legislation 
or do anything else to aid the unemployed. In August, police scattered Coxey’s Army , 
as they were called by the press. Coxey returned to Ohio where he lived to the age of 97 
and died in 1951, still advocating federally fi nanced highway improvement and pleased to 
see his goals partially fulfi lled by the New Deal’s employment programs in the 1930s. 
The American Railway Union, the Pullman Strike of 1894, and the 
Socialist Party 
Th e American Railway Union was created in 1893 and led by Eugene V. Debs, who 
would go on to play an important role in American labor and political life for the next 
several decades. Debs was born in 1855 in Terre Haute, Indiana, and left school at 
15 to take a job on the railroads. In 1875, he joined the Brotherhood of Locomotive 
Firemen but soon came to believe that having diff erent unions for engineers, fi remen, 
brakemen, and for the workers who maintained the tracks, was a recipe for defeat. His 
response was to help organize one union for everyone who worked on the railroads.

Almost immediately aft er its founding, the American Railway Union won a strike 
against the Great Northern Railroad in 1894. It looked like a new force was emerging. 
But then Debs found himself pulled into a strike he did not want, and the early 
successes of the American Railway Union turned to failure when the new union was 
involved in another strike at the Pullman Palace Car Company. 
George Pullman did not operate a railway; he made railway cars—the very best railway 
cars anywhere in the United States. Pullman cars were elegant sleeping cars that cost 
four times as much as other railway cars and that allowed travelers who could aff ord the 
accommodations to cross the country in comfort. Having designed and manufactured 
the cars, Pullman leased the cars and their staff to various rail lines that attached them 
to regular trains. Both Pullman and the lines profi ted handsomely from the exchange. 
To keep his employees out of industrial strife, Pullman built his own town, 
Pullman, Illinois, 12 miles outside of Chicago. In Pullman, 8,000 workers and their 
families lived in 1,400 houses that they rented from the company. Th ey were provided 
with schools, an athletic club, free lectures, a local theater, and health care. Th e housing 
at Pullman was substantially better than housing available to most other industrial 
workers, but the rents were high and the rules strict. Pullman did not allow alcohol, 
and he had “spotters” who kept an eye on the behavior and home life of his employees. 
Facing the Panic of 1893, Pullman thought that the only prudent thing was to lay off 
some workers and cut wages for the rest. He did not, however, reduce rents in Pullman 
since he also expected the town to pay its own way. Nevertheless, in spite of the depressed 
economy, the Pullman Company paid its standard dividends to its shareholders. In 
response, the workers went on strike. Ninety percent of the residents of Pullman did not 
show up for work. Th ey called on Debs and the American Railway Union for support. 
Debs told the Pullman workers that the midst of a depression was a terrible time to 
call a strike and urged them to postpone. Th ey refused and Debs felt bound to support 
them. Th e American Railway Union refused to handle any train that had a Pullman 
car attached. By June, rail traffi c through Chicago had stopped. Th e union took special

care to keep the mail trains running so there would be no reason for federal intervention, 
but the federal government intervened anyway. 
Th e Cleveland administration obtained an injunction ordering the strikers back 
to work, and when they refused, Cleveland ordered 14,000 federal troops to Chicago 
to end the strike. When the army arrived in Chicago, there was a riot and 34 people 
were killed. Federal authorities not only ended the strike but also arrested Debs and 
disbanded the union. 
Th e strike and the jail term transformed Debs. He went to jail a charismatic labor 
leader. He came out convinced that the American economic system was permanently 
stacked against workers and their unions and that the only way to bring about change 
was political. He supported the Populist movement in the 1896 election but then 
founded the Socialist Party in the United States. Th e Socialists advocated government 
ownership of the nation’s major industries and a mandate for higher salaries for 
workers. In the national elections of 1904 through 1920—except 1916—Debs ran for 
president as the party’s candidate, winning hundreds of thousands of votes and giving 
himself a platform to advocate for a completely diff erent economic system. 
Miners and Their Unions 
Th e steel that was transforming America required two key ingredients, iron ore and 
coal to fuel the smelting process that turned iron into steel. Coal also heated most of 
the nation’s cities, and coal-fi red generators produced much of the nation’s electricity. 
Th ese two ingredients had to be mined from deep in the earth, as did several other 
resources of great importance to the United States. Gold and silver were still the most 
valued forms of exchange. Lead pipes provided water to most houses. Bringing these 
resources to the industrial process required the backbreaking and dangerous work of 
miners. As the United States industrialized, the need for mines and miners grew exponentially. 
However, since every dollar paid to a miner increased the cost of fi nished 
products, or reduced the profi ts of those who owned the manufacturing process, mine 
owners were determined to keep the pay of miners as low as possible; recruiting new 
immigrants who found themselves with few options. 
Federal troops, on orders from President Cleveland, escorted trains and destroyed the union in the aftermath 
of the Pullman Strike.

Chapter 18 Responses to Industrialism, Responses to Change 561 
Even before the Great Railway Strike of 1877, the country’s coal miners had been 
an angry lot. Coal had been mined in Pennsylvania’s Schuylkill Valley for generations, 
but in the 1860s and 1870s, miners had to dig deeper than ever, using pumps to lower 
the water table and machinery to ventilate the mines. Th ose deep mines were dangerous. 
Th e pumps could fail or a new stream could break through and drown miners. 
Tunnels could collapse. Methane or other dangerous gasses could collect and kill miners 
before they knew what was happening. And of course, the very properties that 
made coal valuable made fi re an ever-present danger. 
In the aft ermath of the Panic of 1873, the mine owners cut pay, and in response, the 
miner’s union called a strike. By January 1875, Pennsylvania coal production stopped. 
Since cities were heated with coal, midwinter seemed like a good time to win a strike, but 
the mine owners had stockpiled coal and the cities stayed warm while miners starved. By 
July 1875, the strike was defeated and the miners went back to work, at the reduced wages. 
Th e failure of the 1875 strike produced a secret organization among the Irish immigrant 
coal miners in Pennsylvania, the Molly Maguires, who attacked and sometimes 
murdered foremen, superintendents, and even a mine owner. Th e mine owners hired the 
Pinkerton Detective agency, which had played an important role in the Homestead Strike. 
A Pinkerton agent infi ltrated the Mollys, and eventually 10 men were convicted of murder 
based on their involvement in the Molly Maguires and were executed in June 1877. 
In the 1880s and 1890s, new efforts were made to create a new and stronger 
union among the coal miners of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Virginia, and West Virginia 
that was focused not on violence against owners but on victories for the workers. Th e 
United Mine Workers of America was founded in Columbus, Ohio, in 1890. Th e new 
union’s charter called for ensuring that the miners received a fair share of the wealth they 
created, “fully compatible with the dangers of our calling.” Th e United Mine Workers of 
America was open to all races and religions to avoid the divisions that had undermined 
earlier unions. During an 1894 coal strike in Alabama, the Chicago Tribune reported, 
“For the fi rst time in this district, no distinction as to color was made. Negroes marched 
in companies sandwiched between the white men. A negro and a white miner carried a 
banner.” It was an all too rare moment in American labor history. 
Under the leadership of a former Knights of Labor member, John Mitchell, who 
knew how to call a strike and when to call for arbitration, the United Mine Workers 
won a 10 percent raise in 1900 and then in 1903 won another raise along with recognition 
for the union and guarantees of fair weighing of the coal (since miners were paid 
by the weight of the coal they dug and oft en felt that they were cheated). By the early 
1900s, the mine workers of the Eastern part of the country were better paid and living 
in better conditions than had been thought possible even a few years earlier, although 
it had been a hard road for them to get there. 
Mining developed later in the West than in the East (see Chapter 16 ) but expanded 
rapidly. In 1883, gold was discovered in the Coeur d’Alene region of Idaho, the narrow 
northern part of the state. Before long, the gold was played out but deposits of silver, 
lead, and coal were found. Th e lead and coal, however, were buried much deeper than 
silver and gold, and Western miners found themselves working deep underground 
in dangerous conditions as employees of large corporations that were fi nanced by 
Eastern stockholders. Several unions merged in 1891 to create the Miners’ Union of 
the Coeur d’Alenes. When the price for silver and lead fell on national markets in 
1892, the Miners’ Union went on strike to protest a cut in wages from $3.50 a week to 
$3.00 a week, for a 7-day week of 10-hour days. 
As in Pennsylvania, the mine owners hired the Pinkerton agency to infi ltrate the 
union, and pitched battle broke out between unionized miners and nonunion workers. 
Th e governor of Idaho called for federal troops to end “a state of insurrection and rebellion.” 
In April 1899, striking miners used dynamite to blow up the Bunker Hill Mine 
in the Coeur d’Alene region aft er the mine superintendent fi red all union workers. Th e 
governor of Idaho, Frank Steunenberg, who had been elected with union support in 
United Mine Workers of America 
A new union organized in 1890 to bring 
together mine workers in the Eastern half of 
the United States in one organization that 
eventually became a national union.

1896, called for federal troops to restore order. When Steunenberg was assassinated in 
1905, the Western Federation of Miners was blamed, but none of its leaders were convicted. 
Th e struggles in the West continued, and some of the union leaders, especially 
the charismatic William D. (Big Bill) Haywood, became national labor leaders. 
The Industrial Workers of the World 
On June 27, 1905, over 200 delegates gathered in Chicago to found a new union, the 
Industrial Workers of the World , known as the Wobblies . Th e IWW’s founders wanted 
to create “one big union” of all workers no matter what their trade or skill. Western 
Federation of Miners leader Big Bill Haywood opened the convention saying, they were 
there to build, “a working class movement that shall have for its purpose the emancipation 
of the working class.” Eugene V. Debs expressed the hope that the time had come to “begin 
the work of forming a great economic or revolutionary organization of the working class.” 
Mother Jones, Lucy Parsons, and other labor leaders joined in launching the IWW. 
Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) 
Popularly known as Wobblies, organized in 
1905 to bring together the nation’s workers 
in “one big union” to fight for a radically different 
economic system that favored workers 
over owners. 
2 Costs Benefits Mother Jones became a union organizer and traveled the 
country supporting mine workers, other unions, and later 
the Socialist Party and the Industrial Workers of the World. She was 
arrested often but continued leading strikes with approaches such 
as described below from her autobiography, most likely an incident 
that took place during the United Mine Workers strike of 1897. 
In Arnot, Pennsylvania, a strike had been going on 4 or 
5 months. The men were becoming discouraged.…Sunday 
afternoon I held a meeting.…“You’ve got to take the pledge,” I 
said. “Rise and pledge to stick to your brothers and the union till 
the strike’s won!” 
The men shuffled their feet but the women rose, their babies 
in their arms, and pledged themselves to see that no one went to 
work in the morning.… 
Then the company tried to bring in scabs [nonunion workers]. 
I told the men to stay home with the children for a change 
and let the women attend to the scabs. I organized an army of 
women housekeepers. On a given day they were to bring their 
mops and brooms and “the army” would charge the scabs up 
at the mines.…I selected as leader an Irish woman who had 
a most picturesque appearance. She had slept late and her 
husband had told her to hurry up and get into the army. She 
had grabbed a red petticoat and slipped it over a thick cotton 
night gown. She wore a black stocking and a white one. She 
had tied a little fringed shawl over her wild red hair. Her face 
was red and her eyes were mad. I looked at her and felt that 
she could raise a rumpus. 
I said, “You lead the army up to the Drip Mouth. Take that tin 
dishpan you have with you and your hammer, and when the 
scabs and the mules come up, begin to hammer and howl. Then 
all of you hammer and howl and be ready to chase the scabs with 
your mops and brooms. Don’t be afraid of anyone.” 
Up the mountain side, yelling and hollering, she led the 
women, and when the mules came up with the scabs and 
the coal, she began beating on the dishpan and hollering 
and all the army joined in with her. The sheriff tapped her on 
the shoulder. 
“My dear lady,” said he, “remember the mules. Don’t frighten 
them.” 
She took the old tin pan, and she hit him with it and she 
hollered, “To hell with you and the mules!” 
From that day on the women kept continual watch of the 
mines to see that the company did not bring in scabs. Every 
day women with brooms or mops in one hand and babies in 
the other arm wrapped in little blankets, went to the mines and 
watched that no one went in. And all night long they kept watch. 
They were heroic women. In the long years to come the nation 
will pay them high tribute for they were fighting for the advancement 
of a great country.… 
The last of February the company put up a notice that all 
demands were conceded...before I left, the union held a victory 
meeting…. The women came for miles in a raging snow storm 
for that meeting, little children trailing on their skirts, and babies 
under their shawls. Many of the miners had walked miles. It was 
one night of real joy and a great celebration.

Th e convention adopted a constitution that began, “By organizing industrially we 
are forming the structure of the new society within the shell of the old.” Th is mission 
was very diff erent from the incremental goals of the American Federation of Labor. 
For the IWW, contract negotiations and strikes were only a step “within the shell of 
the old” to help launch the new world. 
In the early 1900s, workers were not embarrassed to sing about their dreams and 
the IWW Song Book described them in songs, including one that mocked the idea that 
the poor should hope that, “You’ll get pie in the sky when you die” instead of taking 
action now. Another IWW song promised that, “If the workers took a notion,” they 
could bring the current economy to a halt. 
Th e IWW was attacked by the press, the corporate world, and the government. It 
was also torn by ideological splits, personality tensions, and factional divisions. But 
for 15 years, the IWW was a major force in labor organizing around the country and 
included some of the country’s most charismatic labor leaders among its members. 
The Garment Industry and the Triangle Shirtwaist Fire of 1911 
Th e garment industry, one of the nation’s largest, employed mostly women. Between 1900 
and 1910, New York City became the nation’s center in the manufacture of ready-to-wear 
clothing. Led by innovative owners, much of the work moved from the small sweatshops 
of the Lower East Side to larger factories in the new high-rise buildings of 10 and 12 stories 
in southern Manhattan. Max Blanck and Isaac Harris operated their factory, the Triangle 
Shirtwaist Company, in Greenwich Village. Th ere, over 500 workers, most of them young 
Jewish and Italian women, assembled the popular shirtwaists (as women’s blouses were 
called) that were sold in department stores across the country. 
In New York City alone, over 40,000 people worked in the garment trades in the 
early 1900s. Although divided by language—Yiddish, Italian, English and a host of 
other languages—the garment workers joined together to protest low salaries. Th e 
International Ladies’ Garment Workers Union (ILGWU) had a tough organizer, Clara 
Lemlich, who had emigrated from Russia in 1903 and who led women in a number 
of strikes. During some of the strikes, factories hired replacement nonunion workers 
while police arrested strikers or thugs beat them up. Women from New York’s social 
elite, including Anne Morgan, daughter of J. P. Morgan, sometimes joined the picket 
lines and they, too, were sometimes arrested or beaten. 
In the late fall of 1909, as the ILGWU considered a general strike in the garment 
industry, many, including A. F. of L. president Samuel Gompers, urged caution. But 
Clara Lemlich said, “I have no further patience for talk. . . .I 
move that we go on a general strike.” Workers cheered and 
the strike began. Factories all over Manhattan were picketed 
that fall. Th e garment industry owners organized their own 
association and refused to give in to the striker’s demands. 
Striking garment workers got help from the national leadership 
of the A.F. of L., and from the Western Federation of Miners 
whose leader, Big Bill Haywood, sent word that “the Western 
miners are hearty admirers of your courage and fi ghting qualities.” 
They also got support from society women like Morgan 
and from African-American women who were being recruited as 
strikebreakers but who refused, though in a meeting they asked 
the union to “exercise a proper consideration of the claims and 
demands of the men and women of color who desire to enter 
the various trades.” Th e long strike ended in exhaustion for both 
sides in early 1911 when the union and the owners agreed to a 
compromise. 
On Saturday March 25, 1911, only a month aft er the strike 
ended, a fire started under one of the cutting room tables

at the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory. Perhaps a cigarette 
butt had been tossed in the bin of cotton scrap 
and dust, which exploded in a massive fi re. Workers 
tried to put the fire out with buckets of water they 
kept on each fl oor, but it spread too rapidly. Th e fi re 
started on the eighth fl oor and quickly fi lled the cutting 
room with smoke. Flames spread up airshaft s to 
the ninth and tenth fl oors. Workers ran for exits, some 
of which had been blocked by the owners who, fearful 
of theft , insisted that all workers use only one exit. 
New York’s fi refi ghters arrived, but none had ladders 
that could reach to the eighth or higher fl oors. Some 
workers were quickly consumed by flames. More 
than 50 jumped from the windows, and 20 were killed 
when a fl imsy fi re escape on the outside of the building 
collapsed. In the end, 146 workers, most of them 
young women, were killed in the Triangle Shirtwaist 
Factory Fire , the deadliest industrial catastrophe in 
Manhattan for decades. Eventually, the Triangle Shirtwaist Fire led to new industrial 
regulations and important labor reforms. At the time, however, when devastated husbands, 
parents, friends, and relatives lined up at the makeshift morgue on Twenty- 
Sixth Street to try to identify the bodies, only the terrible loss seemed real. 
Bread and Roses: The Lawrence Strike of 1912 
A few months aft er the Triangle Fire, on New Year’s Day 1912, a new Massachusetts 
law limited the work week to 54 hours, a cut from the 56-hour norm in the mills of 
Lawrence. The management of the mill companies complied with the law and cut 
wages accordingly. Th ey saw little reason to worry about any protest. Th e workers of 
Lawrence spoke 45 diff erent languages and were divided into diff erent craft s; less than 
one in ten was a union member. Cutting their pay seemed both prudent and low risk. 
But when the pay cuts appeared in the pay envelopes, workers immediately started to 
walk off the job. An estimated 14,000 workers were on strike by the end of the fi rst 
day. In response to the strikers’ spontaneous action, the IWW, then at the height of its 
infl uence, sent some of its top organizers to Lawrence. Th ey planned smaller meetings 
by language groups and large rallies on the Lawrence Common. To get around a city 
ordinance that banned gatherings in front of any of the mills, the strikers devised a 
new tactic—a moving picket line in which strikers did not stop but kept walking in a 
continuous line around the mill. 
When IWW leaders were accused of putting women in the front lines, the IWW’s 
Elizabeth Gurley Flynn responded, “Th e IWW has been accused of putting the women 
in the front. The truth is, the IWW does not keep them in the back, and they go 
to the front.” At some point in the strike, when women, with their babies in their 
arms, marched through the streets of Lawrence with signs reading, “We Want Bread 
and Roses, Too” the strike was given a new name. The public generally supported 
the strikers, and the mill owners eventually agreed to an increase in salary and no 
discrimination against strikers. Th e Bread and Roses strike was a success; probably 
the greatest success in the IWW’s short history. 
Ludlow, Colorado, 1914 
In the mountains of southern Colorado, brutal working conditions persisted in the 
coal mines that were owned by John D. Rockefeller. On September 15, 1913, delegates 
from the mining camps gathered at Trinidad, Colorado, and voted for a strike 
demanding recognition for their union, a 10 percent increase in wages, an 8-hour day, 
the right to elect those who would weigh the coal, free choice of stores and doctors

(rather than only company stores and doctors), and enforcement of Colorado mining 
laws. Mother Jones told the miners, “Don’t be afraid boys. . .Fear is the greatest curse 
we have.” Within a week, 80 to 90 percent of the miners were on strike. 
Th e strike lasted 14 months. It was long and bloody. Th e coal companies evicted 
the striking miners from their company-owned housing and the union arranged tent 
camps. Violence erupted between the coal company’s guards and strikers, and by the 
end of the fi rst month, more than 20 people had been killed. Worse violence followed. 
On April 20, 1914, militia troops recruited by the coal company took up positions 
around the miners’ camp at Ludlow, Colorado, and the nervous inhabitants then took up 
their own positions. No one knew who fi red the fi rst shot, but one shot quickly led to several 
hours of murderous fi ghting. Tents burst into fl ame, possibly from a bullet striking 
something explosive. Over 30 people were killed, including several women and 11 children 
found under one of the tents where they had huddled for safety. Th e Ludlow Massacre 
became a rallying cry for labor, and the loss of life, especially of children, permanently 
tarnished and troubled the Rockefeller family. President Woodrow Wilson sent U.S. army 
troops to restore order and the United Mine Workers Union declared that ending the 
strike was “doing the best thing possible for the men on strike who have suff ered so long in 
order that justice might be done.” Further justice would take much longer.

CONCLUSION 
Th e rapid industrialization of the United States aft er the Civil War generated wealth 
and progress for some Americans and serious new problems for others. Very quickly, 
the disparities that emerged created new and violent tensions in the United States. 
In the South, the end of Reconstruction set the region on a path that would continue 
to deny civil rights and economic opportunities to African-Americans for many 
decades to come. Combined with the country’s growing indiff erence to the original goals 
of Reconstruction, the New South successfully limited the advancement of African- 
Americans through legal exclusions. Even as the South was opening up to the world 
with the introduction of new railroad lines and the diversifi cation of its economy, power 
and prosperity came only to some. Th ose who were excluded fought back, particularly 
African-Americans, who challenged segregation, violence, and their economic exclusion. 
Farmers, white and black, also challenged their economic exclusion from the prosperity 
that Gilded Age America was generating. Th rough a number of organizations, 
especially the Farmers’ Alliance and later the Populist Party, farmers sought economic 
might equal to the giant corporations and political access at the highest levels. 
Industrial workers also organized to fi ght their for their rights. New Unions— 
the Knights of Labor, the American Federation of Labor, the United Mine Workers 
of America, and the Industrial Worker of the World—sought to protect worker’s 
rights. The nation was wracked by strikes, from the Railroad Strike of 1877 to the 
Miners Strike in Pueblo, Colorado, in 1914 as well as tragedies including the Triangle 
Shirtwaist Fire of 1912. Between the railway strike of 1877 and the Colorado strike of 
1914, American workers fought to better their lives and working conditions. While 
some owners were sympathetic, the nation was divided by a great gulf between those 
who owned the industries and those who worked in them. Grand visions of a diff erent 
kind of society were born but not achieved. More basic demands—for higher pay, 
safer conditions, shorter work days—were only partially met, and it would be another 
2 decades, during the Great Depression and New Deal era, that industrial workers 
could get much of what they were asking for from 1877 onward. 18.2

CONFLICT IN THE NEW SOUTH 
Analyze how the combined impact of industrialism and the 
end of Reconstruction created the unique character of 
the New South. 
Summary 
The end of Reconstruction brought about a new era in the 
American South. While cotton remained the prime cash crop, 
new industries and an expanded railroad network heralded the 
arrival of the New South. Southern religion and nostalgia for 
the “Lost Cause” and the pre–Civil War era contributed to the 
emergence of a distinctive Southern culture. Railroads became 
a focal point of racial tension as segregation grew more rigid in 
the 1890s. Th e persistence of black participation in politics in 
the decade following Reconstruction angered many Southern 
whites, and state and local governments took steps in the 1880s 
and 1890s to further disfranchise blacks. In the 1890s, the 
enforcement of white supremacy became an avowed goal of 
Southern state governments. Black resistance to the increased 
racial rigidity of the South took a number of forms.

signifi cant impact on American politics. 
Summary 
In the face of a diffi cult and rapidly changing economic landscape, 
farmers in the late 1800s banded together to advance their common 
interests. Th e earliest nationwide farmer organization was 
the Patrons of Husbandry, known as “the Grange.” The Grange 
worked to create a sense of community in rural areas, and its 
members organized to deal with the fi nancial problems that beset 
many farmers. Begun in Texas in the 1870s, the Farmers’ Alliance 
was the most powerful farmers’ organization in the late 19th century. 
It segregationist policies led to the formation of the Colored 
Farmers’ National Alliance. While some participants in farmers’ 
organizations wanted to stay out of electoral politics, others saw 
politics as the key to real change. Such leaders developed a national 
political agenda centered on making changes to federal fi scal policy. 
Farmers’ organizations, the Knights of Labor, and the Women’s 
Christian Temperance Union joined forces in the populist People’s 
Party. Th e People’s Party (or Populist Party) had a strong showing 
in the election of 1892, and seemed to gather strength in the 
years leading up to the election of 1896. Th e victory of Republican 
William McKinley in 1896 fatally wounded the Populists, leaving 
them a divided force with diminishing infl uence.

WORKER PROTEST AND THE RISE OF ORGANIZED LABOR 
Explain the tensions in industrial America that led to major 
labor strife between the 1870s and 1914. 
Summary 
Some of the same forces that gave rise to farmers’ organizations 
gave rise to new workers’ organizations in the second half of the 
1800s. Th e Great Railroad Strike of 1877 galvanized the labor 
movement and helped make the Knights of Labor the largest 
and most powerful labor union of the 1880s. Th e Knights 
welcomed white and black workers, immigrants as well as the 
native-born, and skilled and unskilled workers. In contrast, 
Samuel Gompers’ American Federation of Labor concentrated 
on skilled workers, organizing them into separate craft unions. 
Unlike the Knights who dealt with general social and economic 
issues, the A.F. of L. focused on immediate workplace-related 
issues. The death of six policemen in Chicago’s Haymarket 
Square in 1886 marked a turning point in labor history. 
For the next 50 years, battles between labor and management 
were often violent and nearly always contentious. The 1892 
Homestead Strike, the 1894 Pullman Strike, the 1912 Lawrence 
Strike, and the 1914 Ludlow Strike exemplify the intensity and 
violence of turn-of-the-century labor disputes. Th e early 1900s 
saw an eff ort by the Industrial Workers of the World to organize 
all American workers into one big union.

No one individual symbolized the Progressive movement as much as Theodore Roosevelt. As 
an advocate of the outdoor life, a “trustbuster,” and a conservationist, he captured the hearts of 
many Americans in the early 1900s. 
Theodore Roosevelt had been president for less than 4 months in 
December 1901 when he sent his fi rst annual message to Congress. 
Th e new president said that, in light of the “tremendous and highly 
complex industrial development” in the country, the “old laws, and the old 
customs which…were once quite suffi cient to regulate the accumulation and 
distribution of wealth…are no longer suffi cient.” He asked Congress for new 
laws and new presidential authority to meet the new situation. Roosevelt 
was ready to act. 
Roosevelt rejected the radicalism of Democrats like William Jennings 
Bryan or Socialists like Eugene V. Debs. He insisted, “it cannot too oft en be 
pointed out that to strike with ignorant violence at the interest of one set of 
men almost inevitably endangers the interests of all.” He was full of praise 
for the corporate leaders who had created great wealth. Nevertheless, he 
asserted, “Th ere is a wide-spread conviction in the minds of the American 
people that the great corporations known as trusts are in certain of their 
features and tendencies hurtful to the general welfare.” And since the “conditions 
are now wholly diff erent,” therefore “wholly diff erent action is called 
for.” As Roosevelt defi ned those “wholly diff erent” actions in the weeks and 
months that followed, it became clear that he was charting a new course in 
American politics. He was no radical, but he was not a McKinley Republican 
either. He was determined to address the anger that fueled strikes—though

he was committed to changing urban and industrial conditions and conserving the

As a result of his efforts, Roosevelt and the two presidents who followed him, 
William Howard Taft and Woodrow Wilson, came to be known as the progressive 
presidents. Presidential politics, however, were far from the only aspect of the larger 
Progressive movement that dominated American life between 1890 and 1917 and, 
indeed, led to the electoral success of Roosevelt and his successors. Th is chapter seeks 
to understand the many ideas that were labeled progressive and the impact of those 
ideas on life in the United States. 
THE REVOLT OF THE INTELLECTUALS 
Explain the role of muckraking journalists and intellectuals in shaping a progressive 
agenda. 
Long before Th eodore Roosevelt became president, numerous people in the United 
States were thinking about how best to respond to the extraordinary changes brought 
about by immigration, urbanization, and the rapid industrialization of the country. 
Upper-class reformers, newspaper reporters, ministers, writers, and college professors 
proposed new ways of ordering economic and political life. At the end of the 1800s, 
rapid industrialization and urbanization across the United States produced a radically 
diff erent intellectual climate. New ideas, and those who envisioned them, began to 
shape the future of industrialized America. 
Utopian Idealists 
Henry George, a young journalist in California, was deeply troubled by the railway 
strike of 1877. Two years later, he published Progress and Poverty . Th e book quickly 
became a bestseller. George understood that there were benefi ts from industrialization, 
but the result, he said, was that “[f ]rom all parts of the civilized world come 
complaints…of want and suff ering and anxiety among the working classes.” 
As a solution, George proposed a 100 percent tax on any increase in the value of 
land or any rents on land. He argued, “We already take some rent in taxation. We have 
only to make some change in our modes of taxation to take it all.” George said that 
his proposal would reduce the value and cost of land, thus allowing workers to turn 
to farming if they wished, which would create a labor shortage that would inevitably 
raise wages and improve conditions in factories. While many economists argued with 
George’s logic, the single tax movement became a political force, and single tax clubs 
sprang up everywhere. In 1886, New York’s Central Labor Union persuaded George 
to run for mayor of the city. Although George lost, his campaign led to a permanent 
reform coalition in New York. 
Ten years aft er George’s book, Edward Bellamy, a journalist from Massachusetts, 
published Looking Backward in 1888. Th e book described a new perfect society in 
which class and class warfare had disappeared in a country of prosperous citizens who 
enjoyed their lives free of poverty or wealth and also free of lawyers and politics. 
In contrast to Bellamy’s hopeful work, Ignatius Donnelly wrote Caesar’s Column 
in 1891, a book that described a country rigidly divided between a large working class 
living brutal lives and a small, comfortable elite. In Donnelly’s fi ctional story, a few 
Americans are able to escape from their world and start a happy new community 
organized around the platforms of the Greenback Party, the Knights of Labor, and the 
Farmers’ Alliance. 
George, Bellamy, and Donnelly and other authors like them were oft en unrealistic. 
Th eir images of a new perfect society seem romantic and their economic proposals 
unworkable. Nevertheless, in a county groping its way to a diff erent economic order, 
all of them gave ideas, energy, and optimism to other reformers. 
single tax movement 
Proposed by Henry George in 1879, the 
single tax—a 100% tax on any increase in 
the value of real estate—was designed to 
keep property values low and therefore limit 
the accumulation of wealth while spreading 
opportunity more broadly in the society.

The Professors 
John Dewey is best remembered for his educational ideas, but his goal was a wider 
philosophical response to industrialism. Dewey was born in 1859 in a small town in 
Vermont, studied philosophy at Johns Hopkins University, and taught at the University 
of Michigan. In 1894, Dewey was invited to the new University of Chicago. Dewey 
accepted the off er with enthusiasm. Chicago in the 1890s was the center of social reform 
in which Dewey and his wife Alice Chapman Dewey were deeply interested. When it 
came time to make the move, however, Dewey had a hard time getting to Chicago. 
When Dewey set out for Chicago in July 1894, most of the nation’s rail lines were 
shut down because of the Pullman strike. He found transit on a Michigan Central train 
that did not use Pullman cars. Traveling in the midst of a nationwide strike was informative 
to the young philosophy professor. He spoke with one of the American Railway 
Union organizers and wrote to his wife that “my nerves were more thrilled than they 
had been for years.” He wondered “if I had better resign my job teaching & follow him 
round till I got into life.” Dewey was considerably less impressed by another passenger 
who was “voluble on the outrage” of the strike because it was preventing him from 
getting home for dinner. For Dewey, the focus was on higher considerations. 
Young intellectuals like Dewey were then challenging the dominant economic 
theory of the time, “ Social Darwinism .” Th e foremost American exponent of Social 
Darwinism, the economist William Graham Sumner, opposed what he called “the 
absurd effort to make the world over.” For Sumner, Charles Darwin’s description 
of biological evolution showed that the fi ttest of each species survive and thus shape 
the future. So, Sumner argued, in the social order, the fi ttest were rightfully the owners 
and the dominant class of society. Th ose less fi t are condemned by their natural 
“un-fi tness” to be laborers and employees. Any interference with the system, Sumner 
argued, would destabilize the economy and weaken the nation. Herbert Spencer, a 
British writer, proposed similar ideas, coining the phrase “survival of the fi ttest.” He, 
too, had a large following in the United States, especially among the wealthy. 
Dewey saw the ideas of Spencer and Sumner as easy but unethical justifi cations for 
privilege. Instead, Dewey believed that wise people could and should intervene in the 
economy to make it more just. His thinking was shared by a generation of philosophers, 
including William James, Charles S. Peirce, and future Supreme Court Justice Oliver 
Wendell Holmes, who in the 1880s and 1890s doubted all ideological certainties and 
certainly did not want to see Social Darwinism become the dominant mindset in society. 
Another young scholar, Richard Ely at Johns Hopkins University, also attacked the 
Social Darwinists. Ely had visited the town of Pullman before the strike and noticed 
that workers would not talk to him, fearing that he was a spy. He called the town’s 
culture “benevolent, well-wishing feudalism.” As a counter to Social Darwinism, Ely 
was developing a very diff erent economic theory that allowed for—indeed called for— 
government to intervene directly in the economic aff airs of the country. 
While Dewey focused on philosophy and Ely on economics, Albion Small was 
helping to build the new academic discipline of sociology. For Small, sociologists did 
not simply study society; they meant to reform it. In 1896, Small sought to help defi ne 
his fi eld when he wrote in the new American Journal of Sociology that “action, not 
speculation, is the supreme teacher.” Dewey, Ely, and Small were all part of a generation 
of academics who shared the goal of changing society. 
The Muckraking Journalists 
Although newspapers had been important in the United States since well before the 
American Revolution, newspapers changed signifi cantly in the late 1800s. When Joseph 
Pulitzer bought the New York Evening World in 1887, he made it the largest circulation 
paper in the country with several innovations—banner headlines, comic strips, 
and investigative journalism. Th e World did an exposé of the speculative adventures 
of the managers of the Equitable Life Assurance Society, which the paper said were 
Social Darwinism 
The application of Charles Darwin’s theory of 
biological evolution to society, holding that 
the fittest and the wealthiest should thrive 
and lead, the weak and the poor “deserve” 
their fate, and government action is unable 
to alter this “natural” process.

“gambling with the people’s money.” Public anger over this news of the insurance industry’s 
excesses led to the election of a reforming Republican, Charles Evans Hughes, as 
governor of New York in 1906 and to new regulations on the insurance industry. In 
addition, the huge response to the exposé made the World a very successful paper. 
Almost a decade later, William Randolph Hearst, who had used the Pulitzer 
formula for his San Francisco Examiner exposés of the Southern Pacific Railroad, 
purchased the New York Morning Journal to compete directly with Pulitzer. Hearst 
hired some of the country’s best reporters, Edward Markham, Ambrose Bierce, and 
Winifred Black, and published his own exposés of New York City corruption. Many 
other newspapers began to imitate Pulitzer and Hearst. 
The trend toward investigative reporting to expose misconduct of important 
people or organizations was emerging even before Pulitzer and Hearst took advantage 
of it. Henry Demarest Lloyd, who wrote for Chicago newspapers, became one 
of the fi rst of the so-called muckraking journalists . Th e term muckraking referred 
to the job of raking through filth. Muckraking journalists saw it as their duty to 
expose the fi lth of corruption. Not everyone liked the new investigative journalism, 
and those who objected included more than just those being investigated. President 
Th eodore Roosevelt thought the journalists described problems but failed to off er 
solutions. It was Roosevelt who coined the term muckrakers . He said the journalists 
were simply raking up the muck from the bottom of society’s pond, and the name 
muckraker stuck. For many, however, it became a term of respect. 
Early in his career, Lloyd covered the 1877 railroad strike. He wrote that if something 
did not happen to improve the lot of the country’s workers, “the country will drift into 
a convulsion as much greater than the convulsion that wrecked the Roman Empire.” 
Lloyd’s 1881 exposé of Standard Oil Company and his 1894 book, Wealth Against 
Commonwealth , denounced the monopolies as a threat to the welfare of everyday people. 
Hearst also launched Cosmopolitan magazine as a vehicle for investigative journalism. 
In 1893, S. S. McClure launched McClure’s Magazine, which until 1926 was the 
muckraking journalists 
Journalism exposing economic, social, 
and political evils, so named by Theodore 
Roosevelt for its “raking the muck” from the 
bottom of American society. 
The Jungle, by muckraking journalist Upton Sinclair, exposed the inhumane and unhealthy conditions of 
meat processing in Chicago. One result was typical of progressive legislation designed to improve people’s 
lives, the Pure Food and Drug Act, which regulated the meatpacking industry.

leader in the investigative fi eld. Investigative journalists—writing with the conviction 
that if people knew more of what was wrong in society they would act to change it— 
played a key role in the Progressive movement. 
Th e January 1903 issue of McClure’s included articles by Ida M. Tarbell as part of 
her continuing analysis of John D. Rockefeller and the Standard Oil Company, later 
published as Th e History of the Standard Oil Company in 1904; Ray Stannard Baker’s 
report of visiting striking coal miners and their families; and the report by Lincoln 
Steff ens on “Th e Shame of Minneapolis” about the trial of the infamous four-term 
mayor of Minneapolis who got rich from payments from opium joints, unlicensed 
saloons known as “blind pigs,” and “disorderly houses” of prostitution. Issue aft er 
issue of McClure’s , Cosmopolitan , and daily newspapers were forcing cities to clean up 
corruption, compelling sometimes reluctant legislators to enact new restrictions on 
monopolies, and helping political reformers gain offi ce. 
In 1906, a young reporter named Upton Sinclair took a job in Chicago’s slaughterhouses 
to report, from the inside, on the meatpacking industry. He found a world 
where workers suffered terrible injury, animals suffered inhumane treatment, and 
unsanitary conditions poisoned the meat consumed by Americans. When Sinclair’s 
exposé, The Jungle , was published in 1906, the public response was immediate. 
Consumption of meat fell precipitously, and within months, Congress passed the 
Federal Meat Inspection Act and the Pure Food and Drug Act regulating the meat 
industry as well as the food and drug industries. While Sinclair’s main goal had been to 
draw attention to inhumane working conditions, the primary result of his eff orts was 
sanitary regulation of meatpacking plants. As Sinclair refl ected years later, “I aimed at 
the public’s heart and by accident I hit it in the stomach.” Nevertheless, the passage of 
reform legislation within months of a Sinclair’s book showed the power of such reporting 
and, at the same time, raised journalism to new heights as a respectable profession. 
Quick Review Which was more important to launching the Progressive movement: the 
theory behind it or the identifi cation specifi c of problems? Why? 
THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE CITIES 
Analyze the changes in urban life that inspired progressive reforms and the impact of 
those reforms on cities. 
The United States grew from a little under 40 million people in 1870 to just over 
75 million people in 1900 (for comparison, the 2010 census showed the United States 
at over 300 million people). Perhaps one-third of the growth between 1870 and 1910 
was due to immigration and two-thirds to a high-birth rate. While the population 
almost doubled, it also became concentrated in cities. Many of the nation’s cities were 
much larger and more densely populated in 1900 than they had been in 1870, when the 
majority of people still lived on farms and in rural communities. In 1870, the United 
States had only seven cities with over 250,000 people and none yet held a million 
people. Th irty years later, three cities had passed the 1 million mark—New York with 
3.4 million, Chicago with 1.7 million, and Philadelphia with 1.3 million. Th ere were 
also dozens of large cities scattered among most of the states and territories of the 
union. Americans were adjusting to urban life, and the adjustment was not always easy. 
The Rise of Machine Politics and the Progressive Response 
As cities grew, a new kind of urban politics took root in the United States, shaped by 
the fact that cities were the major points of entry for new immigrants to the nation. 
Many immigrants desperately needed services, especially help with a job. Some took 
quickly to city political life, fi nding in politics a way to gain social respectability.

Nowhere was the mix of urban growth, immigration, and the need for new services 
greater than in New York City. Within that mix in New York, a new kind of political 
organization, the political machine, was created. In political machines, constituents 
supported a candidate in return for anticipated favors, which would be repaid when 
that candidate was elected. New York’s Democratic political machine was known as 
Tammany Hall , named for the building where it fi rst met. Tammany eff ectively ruled 
New York for most of the years from the 1850s to the 1930s. Many other urban political 
machines were oft en associated with Irish political leaders, but Tammany predated 
the Irish infl uence. In fact, gaining access to Tammany was part of the Irish rise to 
power in New York City. 
Th e most famous, or infamous, of early Tammany bosses was William M. (Boss) 
Tweed, who led Tammany in the 1860s and 1870s. Tweed was a Protestant of English 
background. After holding the office of alderman (city council member) and then 
being elected to Congress, Tweed turned to where he saw the real power, in Tammany. 
In 1863 at the age of 40, Tweed became the chief of Tammany. He made sure one of 
his close allies, Abraham Oakley, was elected mayor while he stayed in the background 
and kept control of the political process. Tweed became immensely wealthy as he and 
his Tammany associates benefi ted from—some said stole from—development projects 
like the Tweed Courthouse in lower Manhattan (now the home of the city’s school 
department) and Riverside Park, built over the New York Central Railroad tracks— 
beautiful municipal improvements that provided jobs but cost many times what they 
should have, with large kickbacks going to the chosen developers and to Tweed himself. 
Tweed and the New York political bosses who came after him robbed the city 
shamelessly, by one estimate taking 45 million dollars (1 billion in current dollars). At 
the same time, the political machine made sure that the city’s poor—or more specifi - 
cally, those among the city’s poor who supported them on election day—got jobs when 
they needed them. When necessary, Tammany created more jobs than the city needed

War, that evolved into a powerful political 
machine after 1860, using patronage 
and bribes to maintain control of the city 
administration.

Political cartoons like this one showing a corrupt political boss handing out special privileges and demanding

to be sure that every loyal voter got one, even if that meant that the city had 20 inspectors 
for its four water pumps and Central and Riverside parks were kept immaculate by 
an impressively large number of park workers. Tammany and other political machines 
could also be counted on for more direct aid when it was needed—a handout to tide a 
family over a rough spot, a basket of food for the holidays, someone to show up at court 
and indicate to the judge or district attorney when charges should be dropped. 
Tweed’s corruption was attacked by the cartoonist Th omas Nast and eventually 
provoked a public backlash. Tweed was arrested, convicted of theft , and died in jail 
in 1878. Some of his collaborators fl ed the country. But Tammany survived, and the 
new leader, John (Honest John) Kelly was the fi rst of a long line of Irish politicians to 
direct Tammany. Kelly avoided the kind of theft that led to Tweed’s downfall. But he 
did ensure that a tightly organized political machine maintained close links to immigrant 
communities and Catholic parishes, as well as local and district bosses. Kelly 
controlled the city’s 40,000 jobs and made sure that loyal Tammany supporters— 
those who remembered to vote the Tammany ticket on election day—got those jobs. 
One of Tammany’s district leaders, George Washington Plunkitt, was also a state 
senator. In 1905, Plunkitt described how New York politics worked. He said that 
reformers failed to draw “the distinction between honest graft and dishonest graft . 
Th ere’s all the diff erence in the world between the two.” Plunkitt would have nothing 
to do with “dishonest graft —blackmailin’ gamblers, saloon-keepers, disorderly people, 
etc.” But there was another way, he said, “Th ere’s honest graft , and I’m an example of 
how it works. I might sum up the whole thing by sayin’: ‘I seen my opportunities and I 
took ‘em.’” He explained, “Well, I’m tipped off , say, that they’re going to lay out a new 
park at a certain place.…I go to that place, and I buy up all the land I can in the neighborhood.…
ain’t it perfectly honest to charge a good price and make a profi t on my 
investment and foresight?” It was an arrangement that Plunkitt saw no reason to hide. 
Reformers might not have liked it, but that was how cities worked in Plunkitt’s day. 
New York was far from alone in the rise of machine politics that was oft en Irish 
dominated. Most large cities had something similar. Politics in Boston was played at 
the neighborhood level, where a number of legendary fi gures—Patrick J. Kennedy in 
East Boston, John F. (Honey Fitz) Fitzgerald in the North End, P.J. Maguire and later 
James Michael Curley in Roxbury, and most powerful of all Martin Lomasney in the 
West End—each ruled their neighborhood. In 1905, Fitzgerald won election as mayor. 
He served two terms and was succeeded by his arch-rival James M. Curley, who dominated 
Boston politics for the next half century. Fitzgerald’s favorite daughter, Rose, 
married Patrick Kennedy’s son Joseph, and their son, John Fitzgerald Kennedy, 
became the fi rst Irish Catholic elected president. 
While the political machines met real needs for their poor and working-class constituents 
(and along the way made a few of their leaders very wealthy), the closeddoor 
deals, the graft —“honest” or “dishonest”—and the political favoritism dismayed 
many. Th e political machines greatly increased the cost of municipal government. 
Th ey also shut many out of offi ce, especially the children and grandchildren of the 
native-born elite who thought it was their duty and destiny to rule. A new generation 
of political reformers began challenging the political machines, making municipal 
reform an important element in the progressive agenda. 
The Progressive Challenge to City and State Government 
Progressive reformers believed that the country’s political and economic systems could 
be fixed if honest people of good will put their minds to it. They had little interest 
in radical reforms like socialism and little sympathy for the old-line politicians like 
Boston’s Martin Lomasney. Th ey were what they said they were, reformers, trying to 
reform current structures of government. 
In their campaigns for efficient urban management, progressive reformers 
sometimes came across as cold and heartless to residents who preferred the

face-to-face dealings of old-style political bosses. Moreover, in their desire to cut costs, 
some reformers attacked services that others thought essential. Progressive reform 
was also seen—sometimes accurately—as an eff ort by an older Protestant and nativeborn 
elite to reclaim power from more recent immigrant groups, especially the Irish, 
who had built up their own political organizations. 
Nevertheless, candidates committed to cleaning up urban corruption and 
providing more efficient urban services came to power in a number of cities. 
Progressive reform cut across the political parties. Republicans and Democrats alike 
included both reformers and those who resisted reform. 
Lincoln Steffens, one of the leading “muckraking” journalists, 
was invited to support a reform effort in Boston—called 
Boston 1915—by local businessmen in 1908. Boston taught 
Steffens some important lessons about not only the role of 
political machines but also the place of reformers like himself in 
the life of the urban poor. 
My sponsor, E. A. Filene, called together a group of earnest, 
representative men, some of them reformers, not all…I 
[asked them], Who was the worst, the most impossible, man 
in Boston? 
“Martin Lomasney,” they said, all in quick agreement. A politician 
he was.…and the next morning early I took my little 
dog, Mickey Sweeney, and went over in the bad wards where 
Martin Lomasney was the boss.… 
“Who do you want?” he demanded. 
“Martin Lomasney.” 
“That’s me,” he said. “Who are you?” 
I told him. “Sure,” he said. “I’ve read your stuff. What do you 
want?”… 
“The reformers sent me to you,”…“I asked them who was 
the worst man in town, and they named you. So I’ve 
come to get the low-down on things, and—will you give 
it to me?”… 
“You must want something,” Martin grumbled at me.… 
“Yes,” I said. “Police graft. What do you do about the petty 
crooks?” 
He was cross, or he pretended to be. “What do you mean 
by petty crooks?” 
“Oh, you know, the dips, the burglars and thieves, the 
regular professional crooks that we honest grafters call 
criminals.” 
“And what do you mean by what I do about them?” 
“Well, you go to the front for them, don’t you? See the district 
attorney or a judge or the cops—you get them off, 
don’t you?” 
“Yes, I do,” he said, dropping his feet and facing me with 
three fingers thrust under my nose. “Three times.” 
I laughed. “Ah, now, don’t you sometimes do it four times?” 
He was defying me. “Seven times? Martin, don’t you even 
get ‘em off seventy times seven times?” 
“Yes, I do,” he burst. “I never quit some of ‘em, not the way 
you do.” 
“Of course,” I said. “You stick, but tell me, how do you justify 
it to yourself, saving these hopeless crooks over and 
over and over again when you know they’ll come back 
and do it over and over and over again!” 
I did not expect him to answer this question. It was more 
of an exclamation on my part, but he did answer it; 
inarticulate people can sometimes express themselves. 
“I think,” said Martin Lomasney, “there there’s got to be 
in every ward somebody that any bloke can come 
to—no matter what he’s done—and get help. Help, 
you understand; none of your law and your justice, 
but help.” 
That hit me hard, and we got no further that day.… 
They provided help and counsel and a hiding-place in 
emergencies for friendless men, women, and children 
who were in dire need, who were in guilty need, with 
the mob of justice after them. And, as I sat there and 
thought I saw that if we were to build up in Boston an 
organization to replace the political machine and so win 
the town the loyalty that now went to the boss and his 
party, we must provide for that service.

Grover Cleveland was elected mayor of Buff alo, New York, as a Democrat in 1881 
with a promise to clean up the municipal corruption. Cleveland established a reputation 
for honesty, especially aft er he rejected a street-cleaning contract approved by the 
city council as a “bare-faced, impudent, and shameless scheme.” Cleveland’s honesty 
led to his election as a reform governor of New York and, only 2 years later, to the 
presidency and the White House. 
Hazen S. Pingree was elected mayor of Detroit, Michigan, as a Republican reformer. 
Born in Maine in1840, Pingree served in the Union army, then moved to Detroit 
where he went to work in a shoe factory, and by the 1880s, owned one of the largest 
shoe manufacturers in the Midwest. In 1889, Republican business leaders, determined 
to oust Detroit’s Democratic machine, sought out Pingree who quickly took to politics, 
was a tough campaigner, and became a popular mayor. Pingree challenged the awarding 
of city contracts for the schools, ferries, toll roads, and street and sewer services. 
When the private City Railway Company wanted a long-term contract, Pingree forced 
them to cut fares from 5 cents to 3 cents, a signifi cant benefi t to Detroit’s citizens. 
When the depression of 1893 put 25,000 of Detroit’s 250,000 people out of work, 
Pingree, who did not want to increase municipal spending, convinced owners of 
vacant lots to allow the city to use them, provided seeds and farm implements to the 
unemployed, and urged people all over the city to start their own potato patches and 
vegetable plots. In time, he became known as “Potato Patch Pingree” for his eff orts. 
Samuel M. Jones, known as “Golden Rule Jones,” served as mayor of Toledo, 
Ohio, from 1897 until 1904. Jones started work as a day laborer, but eventually started 
his own oil company. When Jones sold the company to Standard Oil, he emerged a 
rich man. Reform-minded business leaders nominated Jones for mayor in Toledo in 
an eff ort to dislodge a corrupt machine. Jones spent municipal funds freely, opening 
kindergartens, building parks, and instituting an 8-hour day for city workers. He also 
called on voters to renounce political parties, believing that a nonpartisan approach to 
politics would work best. Th e Republican Party, unhappy with Jones’s free-spending 
ways, refused to renominate him, but he was elected as an independent and continued 
to serve as a popular mayor until his death. His successor in offi ce, Brand Whitlock, 
continued his policies through four terms until President Woodrow Wilson appointed 
Whitlock as U.S. ambassador to Belgium on the eve of World War I. Between them, 
Jones and Whitlock gave Toledo a national reputation for good government and eff ective 
public services when many cities were still mired in corruption and ineffi ciency. 
Other cities were also known for their progressive mayors, including San Francisco’s 
James D. Phelan, 1897–1902, and Cleveland’s Tom Loft on Johnson, 1899–1909. 
Grover Cleveland and Hazen S. Pingree both moved from the mayor’s office to 
become governor of their states. Th e move was not merely upward political mobility. 
Many progressive reformers became convinced that legislation at the state level was 
essential to limit the power of corporations or corrupt urban machines. Other state 
reforms became core progressive issues, especially proposals for initiative , referendum , 
and recall , measures aimed at limiting the power of political elites by giving voters the 
chance to change government policy. South Dakota in the 1890s, Oregon in 1902, and 
then other states, especially in the West, began adopting these measures. Initiative laws 
allowed voters to put new laws on the ballot through a petition process while a referendum 
allowed a similar process to review legislation already in force in a state. Finally, 
recall petitions and votes allowed voters to remove public offi cials— legislators, mayors, 
governors—from offi ce before their terms ended. Never as popular east of the Mississippi 
as in the West, initiative, referendum, and recall were typical progressive measures, based 
on the same assumption that drove muckraking journalists: an educated and informed 
public would do the right thing once the right information was in hand. 
Governors and legislatures also adopted other reforms in the progressive era. 
Workers who were injured on the job had been left on their own or blamed for accidents, 
but progressives passed worker’s compensation laws. Some passed limits on

the length of the work day, especially for women, and tried to regulate the safety of 
working conditions. 
Reform came to New York City by a diff erent route. Seth Low, the president of 
Columbia University, was elected mayor of New York as an anti-Tammany candidate 
in 1901. He fought graft and instituted civil service reform, but Low was not popular, 
especially in communities that depended on Tammany, and he was defeated for 
reelection 2 years later. At that point, New York was back in Tammany hands, and 
Tammany’s boss, Charles Murphy, was also the most powerful politician in the state 
although he held no offi ce. Aft er state elections in 1910, however, Murphy launched 
his own reform efforts. He selected two Tammany loyalists who were among the 
youngest and newest in the legislature, 33-year-old Robert F. Wagner in the Senate 
and 38-year-old Alfred E. Smith in the House, to be the party leaders. Wagner and 
Smith were known as the “Tammany Twins.” In their long political careers, they were 
also among the most important reformers in American history. 
Aft er the Triangle Factory Fire in 1911 (see Chapter 18 ) , Murphy knew they had 
to do something or lose the support of families who had lost so many daughters and 
sons in the fi re. Murphy directed Wagner and Smith to sponsor the creation of the 
New York Factory Investigating Commission, which the legislature approved within 
3 months. Where Tammany-controlled police offi cers had harassed striking garment 
workers only months before, the Tammany-created Factory Investigating Commission 
hired some of the same strikers to investigate conditions in the city’s garment industries, 
where they found unsafe and unworkable fi re escapes and locked exits. A social 
worker, Frances Perkins, who had witnessed the Triangle Fire, was one of many to 
volunteer her services to the Factory Investigating Commission. Perkins also wrote 
much of the legislation that came from the commission’s work. In the 2 years, Wagner 
and Smith, working closely with Perkins, pushed 36 measures through the New York 
legislature, including those requiring sprinklers in high-rise buildings, fi re drills in 
large shops, unlocked exits, and a reorganization of the state Department of Labor to 
enforce the new regulations. 
Later, these New Yorkers would bring progressive legislation to a national 
stage. Frances Perkins served as the head of the state’s Department of Labor and 
then from 1933 to 1945 as the U.S. Secretary of Labor, the fi rst woman to serve in a

presidential cabinet. Robert Wagner went to Washington as a U.S. Senator where he 
sponsored legislation creating the Social Security system and legislation guaranteeing 
unemployment insurance and workers’ compensation. In addition, he sponsored 
the Wagner Act, which gave labor unions the right to bargain eff ectively—the most 
important piece of labor legislation enacted in the United States in the 1900s. Al Smith 
served as a progressive governor of New York in the 1920s and as the Democratic 
nominee for U.S. president in 1928, the fi rst Catholic nominated by a major party. 
Progressive reform had influenced one of the most powerful political machines, 
Tammany, and in turn, Tammany had cultivated powerfully eff ective legislators who 
generated historic reforms. 
Progressive Education 
In 1899, John Dewey wrote The School and Society, describing what he thought a 
progressive approach to education should be, one that he had tried to create with his 
wife, Alice Chapman Dewey, and Ella Flagg Young, a Chicago teacher leader (who 
would later be superintendent of schools in Chicago, the fi rst woman to lead a big city 
system). Together, they opened the Laboratory School at the University of Chicago in 
1896, a child-centered approach. For Dewey and others, the focus was not on structure 
at all, but on the child. Th ese child-centered progressives wanted to shift the emphasis 
in schools from the curriculum to the needs of the child. Progressive education meant 
many diff erent things to diff erent people, and Dewey represented only one aspect of 
it. Other educators who also called themselves progressives argued bitterly with him. 
For some, progressive education meant reorganizing schools to be more business-like, 
with centralized administrations and bureaucratic top-down modes of decision making. 
Progressive teachers wanted to restructure schools to give themselves more voice 
and more infl uence while also earning better pay and teaching smaller classes. For yet 
others, the goal was to make education scientifi c and to use standardized testing to 
improve schools. Certainly in the fi eld of education there were many movements that 
called themselves progressive, and no one defi nition fi t all of them. 
Jane Addams and the Settlement House Movement 
In 1913, when Jane Addams had been living at Hull House on Halsted Street in 
Chicago for more than 20 years, she summed up her belief about the role of the settlement 
house and all eff orts to improve society. “We have learned to say,” she wrote “that 
the good must be extended to all of society before it can be held secure by any one person 
or any one class; but we have not yet learned to add to that statement, that unless 
all men and all classes contribute to a good, we cannot even be sure it is worth having.” 
While many progressives might have agreed that society must fi nd a way to extend the 
good things of life to all citizens, far fewer would have agreed with Addams that all 
citizens needed to play a role in defi ning what “good” looked like. Nevertheless, she 
held fi rm on both points. At Hull House, social reformers met those they were trying 
to help in face-to-face encounters, and all involved learned from each other. 
Addams was born to a comfortable life in 1860 (her father was a friend of Abraham 
Lincoln’s) and moved to Chicago in 1889 when she and her friend Ellen Starr opened 
Hull House. Chicago’s Hull House, though not the fi rst American settlement house, 
became the model for most others. Addams said she was at Hull House to be a part 
of the community, not to off er help from above. She knew that she was living there as 
much to learn as to help her economically poorer neighbors. 
Hull House and similar settlement houses in other cities organized badly needed 
social services in poor urban neighborhoods. Lillian Wald and Mary Brewster founded 
the Henry Street Settlement and the Henry Street Visiting Nurse Services in New York 
City’s Lower East Side. Others settlement houses, including Hull House, did the same. 
Visiting nurses based in settlement houses visited the tenement apartments of the 
poor and brought medical help.

Jane Addams (1860–1935) spent all of her adult 
life at Hull House in Chicago, living among the 
city’s poor. She not only provided social services 
but also learned much from her neighbors.

Under Addams leadership, Hull House did more than provide services to the 
poor. It also took the side of the poor in labor and legal disputes. When Addams 
realized that young women strikers were in danger of losing their company housing, 
Hull House launched a cooperative women’s boarding house. Such direct support for 
strikers did not endear Addams to some of Chicago’s most powerful leaders who were 
willing to tolerate, even support, social services but were hostile to her involvement 
in a strike. Nevertheless, such eff orts solidifi ed her base within the communities that 
mattered the most to her. 
Quick Review Why were political reforms, school reforms, and assistance for the working 
class deemed necessary to improve life in American cities? Which were the most benefi - 
cial? Were some harmful? 
Jane Addams was a younger contemporary of Mother Jones 
but from a very different background. She and her good 
friend Ellen Starr opened Hull House in one of Chicago’s poorest 
neighborhoods in September 1889, and Addams lived there 
for the next 45 years serving successive generations of Chicago’s 
poor. In the process, she became a nationally and internationally 
known advocate for settlement houses and, later, for political 
reform and an end to war. Nevertheless, for all of her national 
and international travel and fame, her home and her roots 
remained on Halsted Street where she lived until she died in 1935. 
The next January [1889] found Miss Starr and myself in 
Chicago, searching for a neighborhood in which we might 
put our plans into execution. In our eagerness to win friends 
for the new undertaking, we utilized every opportunity to set 
forth the meaning of the Settlement as it had been embodied 
in Toynbee Hall, although in those days we made no appeal for 
money, meaning to start with our own slender resources.… 
In those early days we were often asked why we had come 
to live on Halsted Street when we could afford to live somewhere 
else. I remember one man who used to shake his head 
and say it was “the strangest thing he had met in his experience,” 
but who was finally convinced that it was “not strange 
but natural.” In time it came to seem natural to all of us that 
the Settlement should be there. If it is natural to feed the hungry 
and care for the sick, it is certainly natural to give pleasure 
to the young, comfort to the aged, and to minister to the 
deep-seated craving for social intercourse that all men feel. 
Whoever does it is rewarded by something, which, if not gratitude, 
is at least spontaneous and vital and lacks that irksome 
sense of obligation with which a substantial benefit is too 
often acknowledged.… 
From the first it seemed understood that we were ready to 
perform the humblest neighborhood services. We were asked 
to wash the newborn babies, and to prepare the dead for 
burial, to nurse the sick, and to “mind the children.”… 
But in spite of some untoward experiences, we were 
constantly impressed with the uniform kindness and courtesy 
we received. Perhaps these first days laid the simple human 
foundations which are certainly essential for continuous 
living among the poor: first, genuine preference for residence 
in an industrial quarter to any other part of the city, because 
it is interesting, and makes the human appeal; and second, 
the conviction in the words of Canon Barnett, that the things 
which make men alike are finer and better than the things 
that keep them apart, and that these basic likenesses, if they 
are properly accentuated, easily transcend the less essential 
differences of race, language, creed, and tradition. 
Perhaps even in those first days we made a beginning 
toward that object which was afterward stated in our charter: 
“To provide a center for a higher civic and social life; to institute 
and maintain educational and philanthropic enterprises, 
and to investigate and improve the conditions in the industrial 
districts of Chicago.”

RELIGIOUS RESPONSES TO THE GILDED AGE 
Explain the main currents of religiously based reform movements during the 
progressive era. 
In the late 1800s, reform movements seeking to improve the lives of working people, 
bring an end to municipal corruption, and build a just economic order oft en took on 
the language and style of evangelical religion. Both reform movements and religious 
revivals emphasized personal and social transformation. Both wanted changes in people’s 
hearts and were unafraid to use government to bring about changes in behavior. 
Many reformers were themselves Protestants, and reform eff orts were oft en rooted in 
the ideas and individualistic ethos of Protestant Christianity. 
Temperance and the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union 
Certainly no political renewal movement was more rooted in Protestant Christianity than 
the women’s campaign against alcohol that began in the 1870s (see Map 19-1). Early in 
the 1800s, many Protestant ministers began to oppose excessive drinking, and some 
Protestants took a strong stand against liquor. Still, most Americans continued to drink 
alcohol. Th e Panic of 1873, however, led a group of Midwestern women to start a new temperance 
movement. Many women seemed to reach the same conclusion at about the same 
time: liquor was consuming their husbands’ wages while leading the men to arrive home 
drunk and ready to abuse wives and children. Th e answer to this problem, and the key to 
defending their homes and families, they said, was a campaign against “Demon Rum.”

In Hillsboro, Ohio, women began to meet to pray and then to take their prayers 
into the local saloons or, if banned, to stand outside and pray. Th rough the depression 
winter of 1873–1874, Ohio women claimed credit for closing some 3,000 saloons. Th e 
following fall, in November 1874, 200 women from 17 states met in Cleveland and 
formed the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU). Th ey were determined 
to make temperance—abstinence from liquor—the key moral and political issue of 
the decade. In the process, the WCTU empowered a generation of women who had 
been taught that ladylike behavior meant quietly taking care of home and family and 
leaving politics to men. 
When the WCTU began, Frances E. Willard, dean of women and professor at 
Northwestern University in Chicago, was too busy with her academic duties to pay 
much attention. Soon thereaft er, however, she left Northwestern to become a full-time 
organizer for the WCTU. Five years later in 1879, Willard became its second president, 
and she led the WCTU for the next 24 years until her death in 1898, becoming 
probably the most prominent woman in the United States at the time. 
Under Willard’s leadership, the WCTU broadened its goals while never losing 
sight of ending the use of alcohol. Willard was convinced that “much of the evil by 
which the country is cursed,” especially the evil of drink, is the fault of “the men in 
power whose duty is to make and administer the laws.” She took the organization 
into the political arena, demanding for women the right to vote so they could vote 
on matters aff ecting drink and the home. She coined the phrase “home protection” 
to describe the WCTU’s agenda. If drink was destroying families, she argued, then 
women needed the right to defend their families. If the WCTU was going to pursue 
its mission of saving homes and reconstructing the nation, then Willard insisted, “We 
must show power.” 
By the time Willard died, the WCTU had almost 200,000 members, a 12-story 
national headquarters in Chicago, and a powerful national presence. 
Others took the temperance cause in very diff erent directions. Carry Nation, from 
Kiowa, Kansas, was married to a man who turned out to be a hopeless drunk. Aft er he 
died, Nation moved and married a nondrinker. In response to what she believed was a 
call from God, Nation went back to Kiowa and smashed up the local saloon, breaking 
bottles, mirrors, and pictures. She followed up with “hatchetations” of other saloons 
and became a national symbol of one version of the temperance movement. 
Whether in the direct action of Carry Nation or the more organized approach of 
Frances Willard, the temperance movement changed the United States. It laid a solid 
foundation not only for the Eighteenth Amendment that in 1919 banned the manufacture 
and sale of liquor but also for the Nineteenth Amendment that a few months 
later in 1920 gave women the right to vote. Th e temperance crusade also demonstrated 
the power of organized religion, both in churches led by clergy and in extradenominational 
organizations oft en led by women. Th e United States in the late 1800s was still 
an overwhelmingly Protestant country, and a movement that could tap the Protestant 
religious fervor of the nation’s majority could go far. 
The Social Gospel 
In 1897, Charles M. Sheldon, a young Congregationalist pastor in Topeka, Kansas, 
published a novel, In His Steps, which eventually sold 15 million copies. In His Steps 
told of a fi ctionalized minister who asks his congregation, “What would be the result, 
if in this city every church member should begin to do as Jesus would do?…What 
would Jesus do in the matter of wealth?” In the novel, the question “What would Jesus 
do?” transformed the town. Similarly, In His Steps also struck a chord in the country. 
Sheldon’s question, “What would Jesus do?” led many Protestants to embrace reform 
movements. 
Other religious leaders began to talk of what they called the Social Gospel , which 
was based on the idea that improving society was both the right thing for religious

Jacob A. Riis, an immigrant from Denmark working as a 
newspaper police reporter, published How the Other Half Lives 
in 1890. In that book, Riis sought to describe to the city’s well-off 
residents the housing conditions of New York’s poor, especially 
through his photographs. He described parts of lower Manhattan: 
The death of a child in a tenement was registered at the 
Bureau of Vital Statistics as “plainly due to suffocation in 
the foul air of an unventilated apartment.”…Another was the 
case of a hard-working family of man and wife, young people 
from the old country, who took poison together in a Crosby 
Street tenement because they were “tired.” There was no other 
explanation, and none was needed when I stood in the room 
in which they had lived. It was an attic with sloping ceiling 
and a single window so far out on the roof that it seemed not 
to belong to the place at all. With scarcely room enough to 
turn around in they had been compelled to pay five dollars 
and a half a month in advance. There were four such rooms 
in the attic, and together they brought in as much as many a 
handsome little cottage in a pleasant part of Brooklyn. 
Riis said, “the proprietors frequently urged the filthy habits of the 
tenants as an excuse for the condition of their property, utterly 
losing sight of the fact that it was the tolerance of those habits 
which was the real evil, and that for this they themselves were 
alone responsible.” In pinning responsibility for poverty and misery 
directly on those who profited from it, Riis created considerable 
hostility toward himself but also great publicity for the book. 
Later, Riis described the difficulty he had in getting the How 
the Other Half Lives published: 
For more than a year I had knocked at the doors of the various 
magazine editors with my pictures, proposing to tell 
them how the other half lived, but no one wanted to know.… 
[I]n the church one might, at all events, tell the truth unhindered. 
So I thought; but there were cautious souls there too. 
Eventually, Riis met Dr. Schauffler, the manager of the City 
Mission Society, and Dr. Josiah Strong, the author of Our Country . 
They were impressed with the photos and arranged for Riis to 
tell the stories within How the Other Half Lives to a group at the 
Broadway Tabernacle, a Congregational church associated with 
Schauffler and Strong. Riis continues the account: 
One of the editors of Scribner’s Magazine saw my pictures and 
heard their story in his church, and came to talk the matter 
over with me. As a result of that talk I wrote an article that 
appeared in the Christmas Scribner’s , 1889, under the title 
“How the Other Half Lives,” and made an instant impression.... 
It could not have been long after I wrote “How the Other Half 
Lives” that he [Theodore Roosevelt, then Police Commissioner 
of New York City] came to the Evening Sun office one day 
looking for me. I was out, and he left his card, merely writing 
on the back of it that he had read my book and had “come 
to help.”…There is very little ease where Theodore Roosevelt 
leads, as we all found out.…Mr. Roosevelt was a member of 
the Health Board, and sometimes it was the tenements we 
went inspecting when the tenants slept. He was after the 
facts, and learned speedily to get them as he could. When 
as Governor, he wanted to know just how the Factory Law 
was being executed, he came down from Albany and spent 
a whole day with me personally investigating tenements in 
which sweating [sweatshop manufacturing done at home] 
was carried on.

people to do and, indeed, God’s will. Th ere were many social gospel preachers, but 
the most prominent was Walter Rauschenbusch whose 1917 book A Theology for 
the Social Gospel broadened the defi nition of sin from a focus on individual fl aws to 
include social institutions that oppressed others. Rauschenbusch was far from alone 
in advocating a social gospel. George D. Herron was a pastor whose most famous sermon, 
“Th e Message of Jesus to Men of Wealth” claimed simply that “a rich Christian 
is a contradiction of terms.” Josiah Strong edited a social gospel magazine, Th e Gospel 
of the Kingdom, and published a book, Our Country , pleading for missionary work 
within American cities and around the world. In every city, local city mission societies 
carried out their own social gospel mission.

PROGRESSIVE POLITICS ON THE NATIONAL STAGE 
Analyze the three “progressive presidents” and their administrations. 
A significant turning point in American politics came early in the morning of 
September 14, 1901, when President William McKinley died in Buff alo, New York. 
He had been visiting the Pan American Exposition when he was shot by a lone anarchist, 
Leon Czolgosz, on September 6. Th e president survived the bullet but died of the 
infection that followed. McKinley was the third American president to be assassinated 
While the social gospel was a Protestant movement, social issues also swept 
Catholic America. Cardinal James Gibbons, the long-time archbishop of Baltimore 
and nominal leader of American Catholics, defended the American labor movement 
and the role of Catholics in it to a wary Vatican. Gibbons argued that the rise of 
monopolies with their “heartless avarice” demanded action. 
Not all religious communities shared in the social gospel movement, however. 
Many fi rst-generation Jewish immigrants put all of their religious energy into secular 
political reform and labor movements. Some rabbis, in turn, worried that the 
focus on secular politics would undermine the spiritual world of the immigrants. 
Parish priests in Italian, German, and Czech parishes in Chicago tangled with the 
anarchists and union radicals whom they saw as taking people away from the faith. 
Some Catholics focused on private devotional activities or large street festivals oft en 
devoted to the Virgin Mary, seeing their faith as a refuge from the larger society 
rather than a way to change society. They valued the ministry of individuals like 
Frances Xavier Cabrini—Mother Cabrini—sent to the United States by an Italian 
bishop in 1889 to serve the needs of the Italian immigrants but who, unlike Cardinal 
Gibbons, avoided labor organizing and politics. Religious people, like others, had 
widely diff ering ideas about how to live well in the new urban and industrial society 
of the United States. 
Quick Review How were religiously inspired progressives similar to or different from other 
progressive reformers? 
Even more than his writing, the photographs that Jacob Riis made, like this one titled “Sleeping Quarters 
Areaway, Mulberry St.,” showed middle-class America the poverty in which “the other half” lived.

aft er Abraham Lincoln in 1865 and James A. Garfi eld in 1881. Th e fact that Czolgosz 
described himself as an anarchist led to a strong backlash against the anarchist movement, 
just regaining its political standing aft er the widespread hostility to anarchism 
engendered by the Haymarket violence of 1886 (see Chapter 18 ) . 
Vice President Th eodore Roosevelt, who had been on a camping trip with his 
family in New York’s Adirondack Mountains when McKinley was shot, arrived 
in Buff alo to take the oath of offi ce. Sitting on the train bringing McKinley’s body 
from Buff alo to Washington, DC, was Ohio Senator Mark Hanna, who had helped 
McKinley select Roosevelt as Vice President. Hanna understood what the transition 
meant for many like him who constituted the old guard of the Republican 
Party. “Now look!” Hanna muttered, “That damned cowboy is President of the 
United States!” 
Th ere was a reason that some referred to the new president as a cowboy. Th eodore 
Roosevelt had already had an extraordinary career in and out of politics when he 
ascended to the presidency. Born to a wealthy New York family whose roots went back 
to Dutch New York, he grew up as a sometimes awkward and sickly child. He compensated 
by lift ing weights and learning to box. He attended Harvard College, was elected 
to the New York state assembly at 23, a year aft er his marriage to Alice Hathaway Lee. 
When his wife died, Roosevelt abandoned politics for a cowboy life in the Dakotas. 
He soon returned to New York, married Edith Kermit Carow, and started on his rapid 
political ascent. He was appointed U.S. civil service commissioner at age 31, police 
commissioner of New York at 37, and assistant secretary of the Navy at 39. During 
the Spanish-American War, Roosevelt took command of a unit in Cuba known as the 
Rough Riders, making himself a war hero. He was elected governor of New York when 
he had just turned 40 and was already plotting his own campaign for the presidency. 
Roosevelt’s hopes for the presidency were almost derailed by his diff erences with 
the old guard in the New York Republican Party. As governor, Roosevelt wanted to 
end corruption, tax the street railways, and provide for industrial safety as well 
as workmen’s compensation for those injured on the job. He had advocated for the 
inspection of tenement housing since being shown their conditions by Jacob Riis. But 
not everyone in New York, Democrats or Republicans, liked those new ideas. 
Th e boss of the Republican Party in New York, state Senator Tom Platt, supported 
Roosevelt for governor in November 1898 because his war hero popularity 
and anticorruption image seemed the only way to win the election and maintain 
Republican power. But once Platt discovered that Roosevelt actually meant what 
he said, the boss decided he needed to get rid of the governor before he wrecked 
the Republican machine. Platt planned to sideline Roosevelt by getting him 
the nomination as McKinley’s running mate for 1900. Roosevelt did not want 
the nomination. In 1900, no sitting vice president had been elected president 
since Martin Van Buren succeeded Andrew Jackson more than half a century earlier. 
Even so, the nomination was hard to reject without seeming disloyal to the 
party. McKinley and Roosevelt won the election, and state politics in New York 
returned to normal. Th en, only months into McKinley’s second term, the president 
was dead and the reforming politician from New York was the president of 
the United States. At the age of 42, he was also the youngest president ever. 
Teddy Roosevelt—Progressive President 
Taking the oath of offi ce, the new president promised “to carry out absolutely 
unbroken” the former president’s policies. One observer responded, “yes, the 
same way one carries out the trash.” Th at comment represented an accurate 
view of the new president. Aft er a brief period of mourning, very brief for him 
personally, the White House and the country started to experience Roosevelt’s 
considerable reforming energy, w hich New Yorkers had known for some time.

THE TRUSTBUSTER AND THE SQUARE DEAL Roosevelt soon outlined his departure 
from McKinley and his determination to limit the power of industrial corporations. 
TR (as he came to be known to everyone) told Congress that “there are real and grave 
evils” that come from the power of the great corporations, and the federal government 
needed to assume the authority to supervise and limit that power. 
Only a month before Roosevelt spoke to Congress, James J. Hill, owner of the 
Great Northern Railroad, and E. H. Harriman, who controlled the Union Pacific 
Railroad, met with representatives of J. Pierpont Morgan, who controlled the 
Northern Pacifi c Railroad. Th ese three lines were competitors across the northern 
plains. Th e competition among them kept prices low and helped farmers and industries 
who wanted to ship their products. As had been the case with steel less than a 
year before, such competition struck Morgan as terribly ineffi cient and a drain on 
profi ts. Hill, Harriman, and Morgan solved their problem by creating a new entity, 
Th e Northern Securities Company Limited, to which they then sold all of their railroads. 
In place of competition, the transcontinental railroad routes would now be 
one happy family. 
Roosevelt did not mention Northern Securities in his December speech, and some 
industrialists hoped that his speech was mere rhetoric. Th en in February 1902, the 
attorney general announced that, at the president’s request, he was fi ling suit under 
the 1890 Sherman Antitrust Act to break up Northern Securities. To the new president, 
the Northern Securities Company was too big and too powerful, and the lack of 
competition on the rails meant that the new trust could charge virtually any rates it 
wanted to haul freight and passengers. 
Roosevelt’s actions were not the fi rst time that the Progressive movement led the 
federal government to take action. In response to the assassination of President Garfi eld 
by a disappointed offi ce seeker in 1881, Congress passed the Pendleton Civil Service 
Reform Act of 1883, which sought to replace political patronage with merit in the 
selection of government employees. Chester A. Arthur, the vice president who became 
president when Garfi eld died, strongly supported the act and lost the backing of the 
bosses in his own party for doing so. Th e act created the Civil Service Commission 
whose job it was to give federal employees a measure of protection from losing their 
jobs over their political ideas while keeping federal civil servants—not elected officials—
from actively fundraising or campaigning. In addition, in response to public 
pressure about the power of monopolies, Congress had passed the Sherman Antitrust 
Act in 1890, which its sponsor Senator John Sherman of Ohio said was to outlaw any 
business practices that would unfairly raise costs for the consumer. 
Th e Pendleton Act, however, covered only about 10% of federal employees when 
it was passed and none at the state or local level. Th e Sherman Act had been a virtual 
dead letter after a series of court cases reduced its scope soon after it was passed. 
Suddenly, with the Northern Securities suit, a new administration was bringing the 
Sherman Act back to life and warning of further progressive initiatives to follow. 
Soon aft er the suit was announced, J. P. Morgan visited the White House for a private 
meeting with the president and the attorney general. Morgan told the president, 
“If we have done anything wrong, send your man to my man and they can fi x it up.” 
Roosevelt, who saw things quite diff erently said, “Th at can’t be done,” and Attorney 
General Philander Chase Knox added, “We don’t want to fi x it up, we want to stop 
it.” Morgan then asked if the government was now going to attack his other interests, 
especially U.S. Steel, and Roosevelt responded, “Certainly not—unless we fi nd out that 
in any case they have done something that we regard as wrong.” Aft er Morgan left , 
Roosevelt told Knox he found it quite revealing that Morgan could deal with him only 
as “a big rival operator,” with whom to make a deal. But there would be no deal. 
Th e Northern Securities case took 2 years to move through the federal courts, but 
in March 1904, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed Roosevelt’s interpretation of the 
Sherman Act. The majority opinion said that “No scheme or device could…more

eff ectively and certainly suppress free competition” and ordered the Northern Security 
trust broken up into competing lines. From then on, Roosevelt would be known as the 
“trustbuster,” and he liked the title. 
Roosevelt kept up the pressure for change. In a series of speeches in the summer 
of 1902, he told audiences, “Th e great corporations which we have grown to speak 
of rather loosely as trusts are the creatures of the State, and the State not only has 
the right to control them, but it is in duty bound to control them wherever need of 
such control is shown.” His natural inclination to expand the government’s power 
to supervise corporations was supported by many in Congress and by muckraking 
publications like McClure’s , which Roosevelt may have disliked, but which nonetheless 
provided him with new ammunition with every issue. Roosevelt wanted a new 
cabinet-level Department of Commerce with investigative authority, a ban on secret 
deals between railroads and specifi c companies (of the sort that launched Rockefeller’s 
oil empire), and additional funds for the Department of Justice to expedite antitrust 
cases. Ironically, once Roosevelt had won his Northern Securities victory and gained 
the tools that Congress gave him, he did not pursue many other antitrust cases. Th e 
Taft and Wilson administrations would use the new tools more than Roosevelt himself. 
Th e president had made his point. As was oft en the case during his 7 years in 
offi ce, having done so, he moved on to other issues. 
CONSERVATION IN NATURE As a child, Th eodore Roosevelt was a birdwatcher and 
developed an intense love of nature. Years later, he walked into a cabinet meeting and 
asked, “Gentlemen, do you know what has happened this morning?” Th e members 
of the cabinet waited for important news. Roosevelt told them, “Just now I saw a 
chestnut-sided warbler—and this is only February!” Th e birds did not usually appear 
in Washington on their return from Central America until much later in the spring. 
While Roosevelt loved nature, watched birds, and as president saved thousands of 
acres of land from development, he was also an avid hunter who loved to shoot bear, 
cougar, or just about anything in the wilderness. However on one bear hunt in 1902, 
Roosevelt refused to shoot a bear that had been captured and tied to a tree so the president 
could have the honor of the shot. He was happy to kill many other bears on real 
hunts, but attacking a tied-up bear was unsportsmanlike. His refusal made national 
news and sparked a new craze, fostered by the Steiff and Ideal toy companies—a new 
toy known as a Teddy Bear in honor of the president who would not shoot one. 
Just before he became vice president, Roosevelt published Th e Strenuous Life in 
which he argued that Americans were getting far too little time to replenish their 
bodies and souls in the great outdoors. But the strenuous life in nature that he 
advocated was only possible if the wilderness and the wildlife were preserved for 
future generations to enjoy. Once he became president, Roosevelt combined all of this 
considerable enthusiasm for nature with his political skill to become perhaps the most 
co nservation-minded of any president. 
Although a keenly passionate advocate, Roosevelt was not, however, the fi rst president 
to care about conservation. Harrison, Cleveland, and McKinley all set aside federal 
lands for permanent parks, and both Yellowstone and the Grand Canyon were 
federal reserves before Roosevelt took offi ce. But from Roosevelt’s perspective, too few 
animals were protected, too little land had been put aside, and too little was being 
done to protect the environment. 
Even though his attack on the trusts got most of the headlines, a short line in 
TR’s December 1901 message to Congress said, “Th e preservation of our forests is an 
imperative business necessity.” People like his friend Giff ord Pinchot and members 
of the Audubon and Sierra clubs cheered. Western senators were furious at an attack 
on the prime source of wealth in their states. Again, some hoped that it was a mere 
rhetorical fl ourish. Th ey soon learned diff erently. When Roosevelt came to the presidency 
in 1901, 43 million acres of land were included in U.S. forest reserves. When he 
left offi ce in 1909, that number had increased more than fourfold to 194 million acres. 
19.1 
19.4 

Chapter 19 Progressive Movements, Progressive Politics 587 
19.2

Roosevelt also professionalized the protection of nature. He wrote that the “Nation 
as a whole should earnestly desire and strive to leave to the next generation the National 
honor unstained and the National resources unexhausted,” and only new conservation 
eff orts would preserve either honor or resources. He appointed a former Rough Rider, 
David E. Warford, as a federal forest ranger with authority to protect the 4.15 million 
acres of federal land in Arizona and Colorado. He nominated Giff ord Pinchot, who 
shared the president’s commitment, to be head of the Division of Forestry and, later, 
head of the U.S. Forest Service in the Department of the Interior and gave him “an 
absolutely free hand.” 
Between 1906 and 1908, Roosevelt used—or misused, as his critics said— 
authority given to him by the Antiquities Act of 1906 to declare a 295-acre stand 
of giant redwood trees just north of San Francisco as Muir Woods National 
Monument; 800,000 acres in Arizona as the Grand Canyon National Monument; 
and 2,500 acres, later expanded to 26,000 acres, as the Pinnacles National Monument 
in California. He also set aside the Natural Bridges National Monument in Utah and 
a dozen other similar monuments, ensuring that the land would never pass into 
private hands (see Map 19-2). 
The president’s continued expansion of the amount of land protected by the 
federal government provoked resistance in Congress. In early 1907, Senator Charles 
W. Fulton, a Republican from Oregon, attached an amendment to the Department of 
Agriculture’s appropriations bill that said that no further forest reserves or expansions 
of reserves could be created within six western states without an act of Congress. When 
the bill reached the president, he had 10 days to sign it or risk having no funds to 
operate the Department of Agriculture. Roosevelt quickly approved a total of 21 new 
forest reserves in the six states—Medicine Bow Forest in Colorado, Priest River Forest 
in Idaho and Washington, Toiyabe Forest in Nevada, Blue Mountain in Oregon, and

Olympic and Rainier forests in Washington. When the paperwork creating these new 
forests was done, Roosevelt then signed the agriculture bill with Fulton’s amendment, 
saying that no additional forests would be created. 
Roosevelt and African-Americans 
One of Roosevelt’s fi rst moves as president was to invite Booker T. Washington, the 
country’s best known African-American, to the White House for a meeting and then, in 
October 1901, for dinner with the president and his family. No African-American had 
ever before eaten a meal as a guest at the White House. Roosevelt was making a very 
public statement about race relations in the United States. He was also taking a fi rst step 
toward securing a full term as elected president for himself. Booker T. Washington 
controlled a block of delegates to the Republican nominating conventions since even 
though blacks could not vote in the segregated South of Roosevelt’s day, they could and 
did win election as delegates to national Republican nominating conventions. 
Although neither Roosevelt nor Washington discussed the dinner in public, the 
press made a great deal of the evening. While some reports were positive, papers like 
the Memphis Scimitar called the dinner “Th e most damnable outrage which has ever 
been perpetrated by any citizen of the United States.” 
For the rest of his 7 years in the White House, Roosevelt had a decidedly mixed 
record on African-American concerns. He did not mention black disenfranchisement 
or lynching in his fi rst presidential message to Congress. However, in his 1906 annual 
message to Congress, he said, “Th e members of the white race…should understand 
that every lynching represents by just so much a loosening of the bands of civilization.” 
Th ey were important words, though with too little follow-up. In symbolic ways—the 
White House dinner and speeches on lynching—Roosevelt did more to support 
African-Americans than several of his predecessors or successors. In comparison to 
the energy he gave to other issues he considered important, however, his track record 
was certainly lackluster. 
Roosevelt’s Continuing Popularity 
Roosevelt’s obvious joy at life and enjoyment of the presidency was infectious. People 
loved having a young and enthusiastic chief executive. A friend once said of Roosevelt 
that he “wanted to be the bride at every wedding and the corpse at every funeral.” 
Roosevelt’s large family brought life and vitality to the previously staid White 
House. Alice, daughter of his fi rst marriage, was a young adult who fl irted with and 
charmed everyone she met, including Ohio Congressman Nicholas Longworth whom 
she married in a White House wedding. She would continue to charm Washington 
society for the next three-quarters of a century. Th e president and Edith’s younger 
children, Ted, Kermit, Ethel, Archie, and Quentin played at the White House, chasing 
rabbits on the White House grounds, marching with the White House police, and riding 
bicycles on the lawn and occasionally down the stairs. 
In 1904, the Republicans easily nominated Roosevelt for a full term. Having lost 
with Bryan in 1896 and 1900, Democrats were looking for a fresh face and nominated 
Alton B. Parker, chief justice of the New York Court of Appeals. It was not a close 
contest. Parker was a colorless candidate, but it is unlikely that any Democrat could 
have won. Republicans were the country’s major party and Roosevelt’s energy carried 
the day. He won by a landslide. 
Aft er his reelection, Roosevelt’s popularity only grew, and he and everyone knew 
that he could easily win a third term or, as his daughter Alice kept saying, “a second 
elected term” if he were a candidate in 1908. Nevertheless, he had promised himself 
and the country in 1904 that he would not seek a third term, saying as he claimed 
victory in November 1904, “The wise custom which limits the President to two 
terms regards the substance and not the form.” As 1908 approached, the president 
was tempted to break the pledge but did not. Roosevelt’s goal in 1908 was to fi nd a

candidate who would carry on the policies that he had championed. He thought he 
had found just the right candidate in Secretary of War, William Howard Taft . 
Taft Wins, Taft Loses—The Elections of 1908 and 1912 
William Howard Taft , who had served as a federal district court judge in Ohio before 
becoming governor general of the Philippines and then secretary of war, would have 
loved an appointment to the Supreme Court, one he fi nally won in 1921 when Warren 
Harding appointed him. But in 1908, Roosevelt had picked Taft as the successor most 
likely to continue his programs, and once Roosevelt had made up his mind, there was 
little that Taft or anyone else could do to stop him. 
Having failed miserably with the conservative Alton Parker in the 1904 election, 
the Democrats returned to William Jennings Bryan for a third try for the White 
House. Th e Socialist Party was also growing in strength and their candidate, Eugene 
V. Debs, made a respectable showing. But the election was never really in doubt, and 
Taft won easily on the promise to continue Roosevelt’s progressivism. 
TAFT’S ADMINISTRATION, TAFT’S POLICIES Not surprisingly, given their very 
different personalities, tensions between the outgoing and the incoming president 
began even before Taft ’s inauguration. Roosevelt expected Taft to keep most of the existing 
cabinet; Taft wanted some of his own people. Most disappointing to the conservationist 
Roosevelt, Taft replaced Secretary of the Interior James R. Garfi eld, an ardent 
conservationist, with Richard A. Ballinger, a Seattle lawyer and former reform mayor, 
who was more interested in exploiting public lands than conserving them. Nevertheless, 
Taft kept Giff ord Pinchot on at the U.S. Forest Service, and Roosevelt sailed for Africa 
soon aft er the inauguration, confi dent that the country was in good hands. 
Taft kept a key Roosevelt-Taft pledge and called Congress into special session in 
early 1909 to lower the nation’s tariff rates. Ida Tarbell, one of the best known muckraking 
journalists, insisted that the poor could not aff ord warm clothing because of 
the high tariff charged on imported wool, and many economists felt that overly high 
tariff s were protecting industries that no longer needed protection. Income and inheritance 
taxes seemed more equitable ways to pay for the government. But not everyone 
in Congress agreed, especially Rhode Island Senator Nelson Aldrich and House 
Speaker Joe Cannon. 
New York Representative Sereno Payne proposed reducing the tariff rates and 
substituting an income tax. But when the bill reached the Senate, Aldrich dropped 
the income tax and revised the tariff s up—signifi cantly. Aldrich acknowledged that 
the Republican platform had promised to revise the tariff , but he asked, “Where did 
we ever make the statement that we would revise the tariff downward?” Everyone 
knew that the downward revision had been the promise, but it was not the outcome. 
Even most moderate Republicans criticized the Payne-Aldrich tariff , but Taft signed 
the bill. When Congress later passed bills to lower the tariff on cotton, wool, steel, 
and iron, Taft vetoed them. In the process, he built an alliance with the conservative 
Aldrich wing of the party, losing the support of many Roosevelt progressives. 
While Roosevelt was in Africa, word came to him in January 1910 that Taft had 
fi red Pinchot. Pinchot wrote to the former president, “We have fallen back down the 
hill you led us up.” Th e tariff might be abstract to Roosevelt, but conservation was the 
issue nearest and dearest to him, and Pinchot was the agent TR had counted on to 
keep the movement alive in the new administration. 
On many fronts, Taft kept his pledge to carry out Roosevelt’s policies, in some 
cases with more vigor than TR had ever shown. It was Taft , not Roosevelt, who decreed 
an 8-hour workday for government employees and who advocated the Sixteenth 
Amendment to the Constitution, passed in 1913, to ensure that federal income taxes 
could be collected. In addition, Taft was a far tougher trustbuster than Roosevelt, 
breaking up John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil Company and bringing more antitrust 
suits in his 4 years than Roosevelt did in 7.

THE UNIQUE ELECTION OF 1912 Roosevelt was not alone in his estrangement from 
the Taft administration. Critics abounded, and Senator Robert La Follette of Wisconsin 
was hinting broadly that he might challenge Taft for the Republican presidential 
nomination in 1912. La Follette was a diff erent kind of progressive from Roosevelt. 
He advocated a more open nominating process for candidates and an income tax to 
limit the power of the very rich. He wanted to destroy the monopolies that Roosevelt 
wanted only to regulate. La Follette was also appalled by concessions to the white 
South, believing that if African-Americans “had been fairly treated,” then they would 
have been able to take the places now denied them as farmers and businessmen. 
As Roosevelt waited, La Follette campaigned for the nomination. Th en in February 
1912, La Follette gave a speech in Philadelphia in which, either exhausted or drunk, 
he went on for over 2 hours, repeating himself again and again. He lost not only his 
audience but also the nomination with that speech. A week later, seven Republican 
governors asked Roosevelt to run. TR announced, “My hat is in the ring” and wrote, 
“I will accept the nomination for President if it is tendered to me.” He also set out to 
be sure that the 1912 nomination was, in fact, so tendered. 
Through the spring, Taft and Roosevelt fought it out—Taft always reluctantly, 
Roosevelt with his usual exuberance. In the South, Taft used the party machinery to 
control the delegates. Roosevelt defended his challenge saying, “If that be revolution, 
make the most of it.” Taft responded, “Th is wrenches my soul.…I do not want to fi ght 
Th eodore Roosevelt, but sometimes a man in a corner fi ghts. I am going to fi ght.” 
Taft won in the states where delegates were controlled by caucuses while Roosevelt 
won nearly all of the states that held primary elections, including Pennsylvania, 
California, Minnesota, Nebraska, Maryland, South Dakota, and even Taft ’s home state 
of Ohio. Aft er seeing the primary returns, Idaho Senator William E. Borah declared, 
“There can be but one result, and that is the nomination of Mr. Roosevelt,” and 
Nebraska’s Senator George Norris happily said, “Taft is out of the race.” 
Taft , however, was not out of the race. He still controlled the party machinery. 
When delegates were contested—and 254 convention seats were contested—the 
Republican National Committee decided who should vote at the convention. The 
committee awarded 235 of the contested delegates to Taft and only 19 to Roosevelt, 
sealing the nomination for Taft . 
Two months after the Republican convention, in early August 1912, a new 
Progressive Party held its convention in the same hall. Th e 14,000 delegates were mostly 
middle-class reformers—social workers, teachers, and owners of small businesses. 
A widely distributed cartoon showed former president Roosevelt’s disappointment with his hand-picked, 
but ensnarled, successor president Taft.

It was the fi rst major political convention to include female delegates, and there were 
many. Also attending were a few African-American delegates from border states and 
New England, none from the Deep South where Taft controlled the party. Few of the 
farmers and laborers representing past Populist Party conventions were there. Th e platform 
included support for the rights of labor unions, conservation, women’s suff rage, 
the 8-hour workday, workplace safety, as well as unemployment and old age insurance. 
In a doomed eff ort to court white Southern votes, the platform was silent on the rights 
of African-Americans. By acclamation, the convention nominated Th eodore Roosevelt 
for president and California Governor Hiram Johnson for vice president. In the fi rst 
convention speech by a woman, Jane Addams seconded Roosevelt’s nomination. 
Roosevelt, saying that he felt “as fi t as a Bull Moose,” happily accepted the nomination. 
A convention like no other launched a presidential election like no other. 
Many Democrats saw the Republican split as the chance for a Democratic 
presidency. Champ Clark of Missouri, the speaker of the house, was the frontrunner. 
He was popular within the party, but was a dull speaker. Oscar Underwood of Alabama 
was more conservative, but perhaps a better speaker than Clark. Others hoped to 
be kingmakers. Charles Murphy, the boss of Tammany, controlled the New York 
delegation while William Jennings Bryan controlled many other delegates. Finally, the 
governor of New Jersey, Woodrow Wilson, campaigned for the nomination. 
Wilson had only held elected offi ce for 2 years. He was an expert on constitutional 
law with a Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins, who had served as the president of Princeton 
University from 1902 to 1910. He had sought to transform Princeton from a country 
club for rich boys to a serious academic institution. He battled with faculty, alumni, 
and trustees and showed little aptitude for compromise. 
In 1910, just as Wilson saw some of his most cherished goals defeated at Princeton, 
the political bosses who ran the Democratic Party in New Jersey were looking for 
an appealing candidate for governor. Th ey off ered Wilson the nomination, and he 
surprised even his supporters by being a magnetic candidate, winning easily. Th en, 
to the surprise of the bosses, Wilson kept his word that he would be independent, 
broke with those who had put him in the governor’s offi ce, and refused to follow their 
lead in patronage. He governed as a progressive, getting the state to adopt workmen’s 
compensation, a commission to regulate public utilities, and more open election laws, 
winning great popularity as well as the undying hatred of political bosses. Wilson 
entered the Democratic nominating convention as a strong candidate, but not the 
leader. While Clark led on the first ballots, Wilson kept gaining; on the 46 ballot, 
exhausted delegates gave Wilson their party’s nomination. 
With the nominations of Roosevelt, Taft , and Wilson—a former, the current, and 
a future president—the 1912 election was unique. In addition, a fourth candidate, 
Eugene V. Debs, was once again the candidate of the Socialist Party, and by 1912, the 
Socialists were a force to be reckoned with. In local elections the year before, Socialist 
candidates had been elected as mayor in 56 cities and towns, and one of the party’s 
candidates, Victor Berger, was elected to Congress from Wisconsin. The Socialist 
Party, always highly factionalized, enthusiastically nominated Debs as their standard 
bearer for a fourth time. Some Socialists worried that Roosevelt’s Progressive Party 
would steal their platform, but while the Progressive Party called for governmental 
oversight of the monopolies, the Socialists called for government ownership of all 
large-scale industries—especially the railroads. Like the Progressives, the Socialist 
platform also called for shorter working hours, workers’ compensation, electoral 
reform, and giving women the right to vote. However, unlike the Progressives, it also 
called for ensuring blacks the right to vote. 
Wilson wrote to a friend that “Roosevelt’s strength is altogether incalculable. Th e 
contest is between him and me, not between Taft and me.” He was right. It was diffi 
cult for Wilson, who was running as a progressive Democrat, to diff erentiate himself 
from Roosevelt’s Progressive Party. If the contest was to be one of personal popularity, 
no one was more popular than Teddy Roosevelt. Boston attorney Louis D. Brandeis

suggested a way forward to Wilson. While Roosevelt spoke of the New Nationalism 
and governmental controls over the monopoly trusts, Brandeis suggested Wilson 
should speak of a New Freedom that would give people the greatest freedom by simply 
breaking up the great trusts and fostering competition at every level. Four years 
later, Brandeis would receive his reward when Wilson appointed him as the fi rst Jew 
to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court. 
In the fall campaign, Wilson called Roosevelt a “self-appointed divinity” who 
wanted to control the trusts and people’s lives. Wilson, in contrast, wanted freedom 
from trusts and from government regulation. “Ours is a program of liberty,” he 
said, “theirs is a program of regulation.” Roosevelt struck back, saying that Wilson’s 
approach was “simply the laissez-faire doctrine of…three-quarters of a century ago.” 
Taft morosely stayed on the sidelines. Debs went aft er them all. 
While Roosevelt was speaking in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in October, a would-be 
assassin shot him at close range. Th e bullet lodged in Roosevelt’s chest but a heavy 
coat and the text of a long speech that was in the coat pocket prevented a serious 
injury. Roosevelt, with typical pluck, went ahead with an hour-long speech before 
allowing himself to be taken to a hospital. His chances of victory improved as stories 
of his courage spread. In the end, however, the deep division within the Republican 
ranks, their failure to crack the Democrats’ hold on the “solid South,” and Wilson’s 
use of Brandeis’s antitrust rhetoric all ensured the outcome. Wilson won the popular 
vote with over a million votes more than Roosevelt, who defeated Taft by another 
half-million. Debs came in fourth with just over 900,000 votes (see Map 19-3). 
Woodrow Wilson’s New Freedom 
Woodrow Wilson planned four major initiatives for his administration—conservation, 
access to raw materials, banking and fi nance, and the tariff and taxes. He announced 
that he would call the new Democratic-majority Congress into a special session 
in April 1913, a month after his inauguration and months ahead of when it would 
normally meet. 
While Wilson spoke to the importance of conservation in his 
inaugural address, and while he did push the creation of the National 
Park Service, his commitment to conservation did not come close to 
Roosevelt’s. Wilsonian progressivism focused elsewhere. 
Only a month aft er the inauguration, Wilson broke a custom followed 
by every president since Jeff erson and gave a speech in person 
to a joint session of Congress. Widely televised presidential addresses 
to Congress are now such a normal feature of American life that is 
it easy to forget that no president from Jeff erson to Taft ever spoke 
directly to Congress. Nevertheless, Wilson did, and he continued to 
do so throughout his two terms in offi ce. 
Wilson’s first congressional victory was the passage of the 
Underwood-Simmons tariff, which the new president signed in 
October 1913. Cleveland, McKinley, Roosevelt, and Taft all failed to 
get tariff reductions through Congress, mostly because of the power 
that lobbyists had with the Senate. But Wilson managed to embarrass 
several senators with a very public investigation of the role of 
lobbyists. He also met privately with several Democratic senators to 
hear their concerns and shore up their support. In the end, Wilson 
got a new tariff that reduced the tax on goods imported into the 
United States by at least 10 percent across the board, more on some 
things. Th e new law also used the power given in the new Sixteenth 
Amendment to introduce the fi rst federal income tax since the Civil 
War, starting at 1 percent on incomes above $4,000 (considerably 
more than most Americans made in 1913).

Wilson then turned to reform of the nation’s banking system. Since Andrew 
Jackson closed the Bank of the United States in the 1830s, the federal government’s 
role in the nation’s banking system had been very limited. In the financial panics 
of 1893 and 1907, J. P. Morgan had acted as the nation’s banker, ensuring that the 
nation’s credit system stayed intact. While Morgan’s interventions were essential to 
protect the government and the nation’s largest banks, they did little to help farmers 
or proprietors of small businesses or to allow the government to control the supply of 
money, a role that Bryan and his followers had been demanding for a long time. 
Working closely with Virginia Senator Carter Glass, Wilson was able to create 
the Federal Reserve system in a matter of months. Following the advice of Brandeis 
that “concessions to big business interests must in the end prove futile,” the president 
spent no time with representatives of business but, instead, built a coalition of the 
many factions within the Democratic Party and of progressive Republicans. Th e fi nal 
bill passed the House 287 to 85, and the Senate, aft er a desperate last-minute attempt 
to derail the bill by Frank A. Vanderlip of the National City Bank of New York, passed 
the bill 54 to 34. Before the end of his fi rst year in offi ce, Wilson and the Congress had 
created the Federal Reserve that remains the core of the nation’s banking system. 
During the presidential campaign, Wilson had differentiated himself from 
Roosevelt with his claim that he was the real “trustbuster.” In offi ce, he supported 
his Attorney General James McReynolds in attacking the American Telephone and 
Telegraph Company, United States Steel, and the New Haven Railroad, all companies 
in which J. P. Morgan had an interest. Th en he went to Congress and asked for more 
authority. Th e Clayton Anti-Trust Act, signed in October 1914, outlawed interlocking 
directorates (under which the same individuals might serve on the boards of directors 
of supposedly competing companies), and defi ned unfair trade practices, including 
the kind of collusion over prices that had allowed John D. Rockefeller to create the

Standard Oil monopoly. Perhaps most important, the Clayton Act exempted labor 
unions and farmer cooperatives from the defi nition of a “combination in restraint of 
trade,” a charge that had been used in federal court cases against unions since Eugene 
Debs was sent to jail the 1890s. Although the bill did not give unions everything they 
wanted, Samuel Gompers declared it to be the “Magna Carta,” of labor union organizing. 
Separate legislation also strengthened the investigative powers of the Interstate 
Commerce Commission and created a new Federal Trade Commission with a specifi 
c, if somewhat vague, mandate to limit the growth and power of monopolies. 
While Wilson delivered quickly on some of his reformist campaign pledges, he 
deeply disappointed other followers. When the House passed legislation outlawing 
child labor in February 1915, Wilson did nothing and the bill died in the Senate. 
Only much later in his presidency did he support eff ective child labor legislation. He 
also disappointed farmers, a key Democratic constituency, when he quietly allowed 
a plan for rural credits to help farmers with mortgages to die in congressional 
conference committee. 
African-Americans were greatly disappointed with Wilson. Booker T. Washington 
had a long-standing link to the Republican Party, but during the 1912 campaign, 
younger blacks, including African Episcopal Zion Bishop Alexander Walters and 
W.E.B. Du Bois, endorsed Wilson. It was a signifi cant departure from the African- 
American–Republican Party alliance that had existed since Reconstruction. Perhaps, 
these leaders argued, this Virginia-born and Georgia-reared intellectual could fi nally 
break the hold of segregationists on the Democratic Party. During the campaign, 
Wilson was happy to receive their support, but once in office, Wilson spoke only 
vaguely of a federal commission to investigate race relations in the United States and 
allowed his cabinet to set policy that did not support the African-American cause. 
Citing what they said was white anger at “racial mingling,” especially in Southern 
post offi ces, Post Master General Albert S. Burleson and Secretary of the Treasury 
William Gibbs McAdoo ordered the segregation of offices, rest rooms, and eating 
facilities at the Post Office, Treasury Department, and Bureau of Printing and 
Engraving. Federal employees who had long worked in racially integrated settings 
were now segregated by race. Th e Democratic majority in Congress allowed segregationist 
senators like James K. Vardaman of Mississippi to block black appointments to 
federal jobs that previous Republican presidents had provided. 
Th e black press attacked Wilson for the segregation policy and the lack of federal 
appointments. Wilson’s most pointed confrontation about his racial policies was with 
the African-American editor William Monroe Trotter of Boston. In November of 
1913, Trotter met with the president to lay out a long list of specifi c concerns about 
segregation in the federal service and the lack of African-Americans being hired in 
the government. Wilson responded blandly, saying, “Now, mistakes have probably 
been made, but those mistakes can be corrected.” A year later, Trotter led another delegation 
to the White House and received another round of bland vagueness. Trotter 
lost his temper saying, “We are here as full-fl edged American citizens” and reminded 
Wilson of the support he had received from African-Americans. Wilson in turn 
lost his temper, telling Trotter, “You are an American citizen…but you are the only 
American citizen that has ever come into this offi ce who has talked to me with [such] 
a tone.” Th e president insisted that Trotter be excluded from any future meeting, but 
there would be few future meetings with African-Americans with or without Trotter. 
Wilson’s reputation in the African-American community was further tarnished 
when in early 1915 he allowed one of the first full-length motion pictures, D. W. 
Griffi th’s Birth of a Nation, to be shown at the White House. Th e National Association 
for the Advancement of Colored People was actively protesting the fi lm, which, though 
a masterpiece of cinematography, was also a glorifi cation of the Ku Klux Klan. Wilson 
did not endorse the fi lm, but the president also refused to announce his nonendorsement. 
Later, Wilson signed a letter prepared by his personal secretary saying that “the 
President was entirely unaware of the character of the play before it was presented and

to provide regulatory oversight of business 
activity.

has at no time expressed his approbation of it.” Nevertheless, the fi lm incident, along 
with the segregation of the federal work force, seriously undermined Wilson’s reputation 
among African-Americans. 
When Wilson became president, his agenda focused exclusively on domestic 
policy. In his fi rst year in offi ce, with the Underwood Tariff , the Clayton Anti-Trust 
Act, as well as the creation of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Trade 
Commission, he had extraordinary success. A little more than a year aft er the inauguration, 
however, a political assassination in the far off town of Sarajevo, Bosnia, 
began a chain of events that would change the president’s and the nation’s focus 
in succeeding years. Aft er 1914, international matters, far more than his domestic 
agenda, dominated his administration. Indeed, the assassination in the Austrian 
Empire in June 1914 can be seen as the ending of the progressive era. In the new era, 
discussed in the next chapter, international matters are central.

CONCLUSION 
Between 1870 and 1900, America’s population almost doubled, from 40 million in 
1870 to 75 million in 1900, with immigration responsible, perhaps, for one-third of 
this growth. As more and more Americans crowded into the nation’s cities, drawn 
there by jobs in America’s rapidly expanding industrial economy, a new urgency to 
focus on the challenges of immigration, urbanization, and industrialization took hold. 
By 1900, a rising cohort of Americans—including intellectuals, social reformers, and 
political leaders—seemed to recognize that new ideas and new levels of activism would 
be needed to create a solid foundation for the country’s future. 
Muckraking journalists such as Ida Tarbell, Upton Sinclair, and Lincoln Steff ens 
sought to convince other Americans to heed the call to solve a wide range of problems 
related to the health and well-being of American society. Some reformers attempted 
to rein in the excesses of industrialists and the fi nancial markets; others focused their 
attentions on the urban poor, the nation’s education system, preservation of the natural 
world, electoral reforms, decent wages for the laboring classes, industrial safety 
and sanitation, or—in one of the strongest movements—ending the use of alcohol by 
Americans. 
Beginning at the city and state level, progressive reformers sought elected offi ce 
and sought to use their offi ces to implement many progressive reforms in the conduct 
of elections and in the protection of individuals through such things as pure 
food and drug laws. Th eodore Roosevelt, who gained the presidency aft er the assassination 
of William McKinley in 1901, successfully brought progressivism to the 
White House. He expanded the powers of the presidency to control the power of 
giant corporations, protect the nation’s natural resources, and bring a new vitality to 
electoral politics. Th e two presidents who followed him, William Howard Taft and 
Woodrow Wilson, shared some of Roosevelt’s reformist tendencies and furthered 
the goals of progressivism, changing, in particular, the relationship between business 
and government in the decades leading up to World War I.

RELIGIOUS RESPONSES TO THE GILDED AGE 
Explain the main currents of religiously based reform

Summary 
Protestant religious revival was an important element in the 
Progressive movement. Th e temperance movement embodied 
the connection between social reform and religious 
revival. The Woman’s Christian Temperance Union took a 
leading role in the fi ght against alcohol. Th e WCTU refl ected 
the importance of women in both progressive reform and 
religious revival. Proponents of the Social Gospel movement 
believed that reform was the duty of every Christian and that 
it was God’s will that religious people work for social improvement. 
A new commitment to social issues was not limited 
to Protestants, and some American Catholic leaders were 
also active.

THE REVOLT OF THE INTELLECTUALS 
Explain the role of muckraking journalists and intellectuals in 
shaping a progressive agenda. 
Summary 
Responding to the rapid industrialization and urban growth 
of the late 1800s, progressives promoted new ways of ordering 
economic and political life. Utopian idealists offered visions 
of a transformed society. Academics, including John Dewey, 
Richard Ely, and Albion Small, attacked Social Darwinism and 
proposed new models of social and economic change rooted in 
rigorous intellectual analysis. Journalists and writers played a 
key role in exposing and publicizing social and economic ills. 
Th e muckrakers shown a light on corporate greed, the plight of 
the poor, and government corruption. 
Review Questions 
1. Comparison 
Compare and contrast the ideas of John Dewey and 
William Graham Sumner. What assumptions about social 
and economic inequality underlay each author’s position? 
2. Constructing an Argument 
How would you explain the popularity of muckraking 
journalism in the late 1800s? 
Preparing to Write: Mastering the Details 
Suppose you were preparing to write an essay on the progressive 
utopian idealists. With that task in mind, make a table identifying 
the major utopians included in this section and detailing 
the key components of their work. 
THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE CITIES 
Analyze the changes in urban life that inspired progressive 
reforms and the impact of those reforms on cities. 
Summary 
Between 1870 and 1900, the urban population of the United 
States almost doubled. Immigration and a high-birth rate combined 
to dramatically increase the size of America’s largest 
cities. As cities grew, political machines gained control of city 
governments. Political machines provided services to the urban 
poor, especially immigrants, in exchange for political loyalty. 
Secure in their power, the machine bosses used their positions 
to enrich themselves and their supporters. Th e destruction 
of the machines was a key political goal of the progressives. 
Progressives did not promote political revolution. Instead, they 
argued reforms, including increased government openness, 
responsiveness, and effi ciency, as well as an end to political corruption.

Gospel movement. With this task in mind, defi ne the term social 
gospel . What connections can you make between the Social 
Gospel movement and earlier American religious revivals? 
PROGRESSIVE POLITICS ON THE NATIONAL STAGE 
Analyze the three “progressive presidents” and their 
administrations. 
Summary 
Th e assassination of William McKinley elevated Vice President 
Th eodore Roosevelt, a progressive, to the presidency. Roosevelt’s 
use of the Sherman Antitrust Act against Northern Securities 
earned him a reputation as a “trustbuster.” In addition to taking 
steps to limit corporate power and to increase the role of 
government in business oversight, Roosevelt was a champion of 
wilderness conservation. Roosevelt’s record was not impressive, 
however, when it came to the concerns of African-Americans. 
His decision not to run for a third term paved the way for the 
election of Roosevelt’s handpicked successor, William Taft. 
19.4 
Taft ’s tendency to favor the conservative wing of the Republican 
Party angered Roosevelt and led to a showdown between the 
two men in the election of 1912. Roosevelt’s decision to run on 
a third-party ticket split the Republican vote and contributed 
to the election of Democrat Woodrow Wilson. Once in offi ce, 
Wilson concentrated on reform of the banking system and on 
the expansion of the federal government’s regulatory powers.

Questions 6.1–6.3 refer to the following document. 
In Arnot, Pennsylvania, a strike had been going on four or fi ve 
months. Th e men were becoming discouraged. . . . Sunday aft ernoon 
I held a meeting. . . . “You’ve got to take the pledge,” I said. 
“Rise and pledge to stick to your brothers and the union till the 
strike’s won!” 
Th e men shuffl ed their feet but the women rose, their babies 
in their arms, and pledged themselves to see that no one went to 
work in the morning. . . . 
Th en the company tried to bring in scabs. I told the men to 
stay home with the children for a change and let the women 
attend to the scabs. I organized an army of women housekeepers. 
On a given day they were to bring their mops and brooms and 
“the army” would charge the scabs up at the mines. . . . 
… the women kept continual watch of the mines to see that 
the company did not bring in scabs. Every day women with 
brooms or mops in one hand and babies in the other arm 
wrapped in little blankets, went to the mines and watched that 
no one went in. And all night long they kept watch. Th ey were 
heroic women. In the long years to come the nation will pay 
them high tribute for they were fi ghting for the advancement of a 
great country. . . .

Questions 6.12–6.14 refer to the following document. 
Th e railroad network, in turn, had grown swift ly primarily 
because of the near desperate requirements for effi cient transportation 
created by the movement of population westward 
aft er 1815. Except for the Atlantic seaboard between Boston and 
Washington, the construction of the American railroads was 
stimulated almost wholly by the demand for better transportation 
to move crops, to bring farmers supplies, and to open up 
new territories to commercial agriculture. 
By greatly expanding the scope of the agrarian economy, the 
railroads quickened the growth of the older commercial centers, 
such as New York, Philadelphia, Cincinnati, Cleveland, and 
St. Louis, and helped create new cities like Chicago, Indianapolis, 
Atlanta, Kansas City, Dallas, and the Twin Cities. Th is rapid 
urban expansion intensifi ed the demand for the products of the 
older consumer goods industries—particularly those which processed 
the crops of the farmer and planter into food, stimulants, 
and clothing. 
At the same time, railroad construction developed the fi rst 
large market in this country for producer’s goods. . . . More than 
this, the railroad, with their huge capital outlay, their fi xed operating 
costs, the large size of their labor and management force, 
and the technical complexity of their operations, pioneered in the 
new ways of oligopolistic competition and large-scale, professionalized, 
bureaucratized management.

Questions 6.8–6.11 refer to the following document. 
But there are things which you have said to me which I do not 
like. Th ey were not sweet like sugar, but bitter like gourds. You 
have said that you want to put us on a reservation, to build us 
houses and make us medicine lodges. I do not want them. I was 
born under the prairie, where the wind blew free and there was 
nothing to break the light of the sun. I was born where there 
were no enclosures and everything drew a free breath. I want to 
die there and not within walls. I know every stream and wood 
between the Rio Grande and the Arkansas. I have hunted and 
lived over that country. I live like my fathers before me and like 
them I lived happily. 
When I was in Washington the Great Father told me that all 
the Comanche land was ours and that no one should hinder us 
in living upon it. So, why do you ask us to leave the rivers and 
the sun and the wind and live in houses? Do not ask us to give up 
the buff alo for the sheep. Th e young men have heard talk of this, 
and it has made them sad and angry. Do not speak of it more. I 
love to carry out the talk I get from the Great Father. When I get 
goods and presents I and my people feel glad, since it shows that 
he holds us in his eye. 
—Parusemena (Ten Bears), Speech at Medicine Lodge Creek 
Treaty Meeting, 1867

b. be forced to adopt the culture of European Americans 
by sending their children to boarding schools 
c. still hunt across the Great Plains as they had before the 
treaty 
d. have no more disagreements with European Americans 
over land issues, since the Indian territory would be 
their property 
6.9 Which of the following was most signifi cant in creating a

Foreign Policy and War 
20 in a Progressive Era 
1890–1919 
In 1914, all of Europe went to war. President Woodrow Wilson was 
determined to stay out of the confl ict and campaigned for reelection 
in 1916 with the slogan “He kept us out of war.” Although Wilson 
would not continue to keep the nation out of the European war, the man he 
defeated in the 1912 presidential election, former President Theodore 
Roosevelt, was ready to go to war much sooner than Wilson. As president, 
Roosevelt liked to summarize his foreign policy with the proverb, “Speak 
soft ly and carry a big stick.” When Europe began what was then called the 
Great War, the former president was speaking less and less soft ly and arguing 
that the United States should prepare for war and that Wilson’s neutrality 
was a sign of personal and national weakness. 
Roosevelt’s enthusiasm for a more activist approach to foreign policy 
was not out of character with his own presidency. When he became president 
in 1901, the United States had already acquired Alaska, Hawaii, and 
other islands in the Pacifi c. Many Americans wanted more land, or at least 
greater infl uence around the world. Other than his very active involvement 
in the acquisition of the Panama Canal Zone, Roosevelt had been surprisingly 
cautious in international relations. He reduced U.S. involvement 
in the Philippines, negotiated an end to war between Russia and Japan, 
brokered an agreement to soften Japan’s sense of insult at California’s 
anti-Japanese measures, and sought successfully to keep peace with the 
world. Many of Roosevelt’s strongest political supporters, progressive senators 
like Robert La Follette and reformers like Jane Addams, adamantly 
opposed U.S. endeavors abroad and U.S. involvement in World War I. 
The British luxury liner Lusitania, shown here in New York harbor during its maiden voyage, was sunk 
by a German submarine with the loss of over 1,100 lives in May, 1915, an event that did much to 
C H A P T E R O B J E C T I V E galvanize American public opinion against Germany and bring the United States into World War I.

Nevertheless, although foreign policy is always shaped by many people and many 
forces, presidents Roosevelt and Wilson were certainly the dominant fi gures in U.S. 
international relations between 1898 and 1920. Th eir story, and the world they and so 
many others shaped, is the subject of this chapter. 
CONTINUING EXPANSION 
Explain continued U.S. expansion, particularly U.S. acquisition of what would much later 
be the 49th and 50th states. 
The geographical expansion of the United States that had continued from the time 
it declared independence persisted throughout the Progressive Era. Admiral Alfred 
Th ayer Mahan of the U.S. Navy persuasively laid the foundation for continued expansion 
in his book, Th e Infl uence of Sea Power upon History, published in 1890. Few books 
were ever as infl uential in the development of U.S. foreign policy. Mahan argued that all 
great nations in history had great navies that could control the world’s oceans and, specifi 
cally, that the U.S. Navy needed to be large enough to be a signifi cant player in the 
Pacifi c. He worried that the U.S. Navy was too small and that the lack of U.S. control of 
Pacifi c islands limited the nation’s reach. Th e popularity of his book accelerated developments 
already underway, and within a decade, the U.S. Navy had been expanded to 
the third largest in the world while the United States had annexed Hawaii and Puerto 
Rico in 1898 and had assumed control of Samoa, the Philippine Islands, and Cuba. 
Not surprisingly, some have called the late 1800s the age of U.S. imperialism . 
Whether that term correctly describes U.S. expansion in this era continues to be 
debated. Certainly, thinking in the United States was infl uenced by the ways Britain, 
France, and Germany were seeking new colonies in Africa and the Middle East. Many 
Americans did not want their country to be left behind. Some people in the United 
States agreed with those Europeans who insisted that the white race was destined to 
rule the world’s people. Immigrants or the children of immigrants sometimes wanted 
the United States to intervene in their old homelands to protect the rights of compatriots. 
Even so, a surprisingly diverse array of Americans did not want their country 
involved in anything beyond its borders. Expansion beyond North America was never 
without controversy, even as the United States became involved around the globe. 
Alaska 
Long before Mahan argued for greater U.S. control of the oceans, the United States 
assumed ownership of the huge Russian territory known as Russian America, or 
Alaska. In the 1740s, Vitus Bering, a Danish captain serving the Russian Navy explored 
the Arctic Oceans between Asia and North America. Soon thereaft er, Russia had joined 
Britain, France, and Spain in claiming large parts of North America. A Russian governor 
moved to Sitka, Alaska, in 1799 to administer Russian communities that dotted the 
coast of what is today Alaska, Canada, Washington, Oregon, and northern California. 
Control and management of the vast Russian territory was vested in the private Russian 
American Company. Russians fi shed and traded in sea otter skins, providing support 
for the colony and modest returns to Russia itself. 
The value of Alaska to the Russian company or government was never great. 
Tensions with native residents ran deep. Russians exploited Native Alaskans while 
Western diseases took a heavy toll of the native population. In response, Native 
Alaskans massacred Russian communities at Sitka and Nulato. By 1860, the government 
was unhappy with the Russian American Company and worried about defending 
the long Alaskan coast from the British Navy. 
American settlers in Washington Territory were learning about the rich fi shing, 
whaling, and fur trapping that was possible in Alaska. Secretary of State Seward envisioned 
its value and coordinated negotiations to purchase it from Russia. Th e negotiators 
agreed on a price of $7.2 million, and on October 18, 1867, the Russian fl ag was

hauled down at Sitka and the Stars and Stripes rose in its place. Congress balked at 
appropriating the funds for the purchase and critics called the whole transfer “Seward’s 
folly,” but the nation had gained valuable new territory. Fishing, mining, the fur trade, 
and indeed the sale of ice to Californians made Alaska a good investment. However, 
Aleuts, Sitkas, Kolosh, and other Alaskan tribes found that they had only substituted 
one overlord for another. U.S. troops, miners, and settlers fought with Alaskan tribes as 
they had with native peoples further south. 
Having purchased Alaska, the U.S. government was slow to do much with it. Only 
in 1884 did Congress create any official form of government for what they called 
the District of Alaska. Soon thereaft er, gold was discovered in the district, and the 
Klondike gold rush of the late 1880s expanded the American population of Alaska 
as did 1898 legislation that extended the provisions of the 1862 Homestead Act to 
Alaska. Finally in 1912, President Taft signed legislation giving Alaska full territorial 
status, and the elected legislature fi rst met at Juneau the following year. 
Hawaii 
Although the United States was a major infl uence in Hawaii long before Mahan argued for a 
wider Pacifi c infl uence for the nation, it was in Mahan’s time that the United States annexed 
Hawaii. While the American Revolution was being fought, a British explorer, James Cook, 
landed on a chain of islands that he named the Sandwich Islands, which came to be known 
as Hawaii. Before Cook’s arrival in 1778, there had been no contact between the native 
Hawaiians and Europeans. Th e Polynesian people whom Cook encountered were governed 
by a stable if loosely held feudal monarchy. Unfortunately, like other native peoples, they had 
no immunity to Western diseases, and the contact initiated by Cook took a terrible toll. 
Hawaii’s strategic location halfway between California and Japan and its harbors 
that were perfect for American whaling vessels greatly interested American and 
European merchants and U.S. Navy offi cers. By the early 1800s, Hawaiian harbors 
were fi lled with U.S. Navy ships and private whaling vessels, and Americans mixed 
with Hawaiians on a regular basis. In 1820, a group of New England missionaries and 
three American-educated Hawaiians arrived to convert Hawaiians to Christianity and 
interest them in American culture. 
U.S. control of California with its large Pacific harbors in 1848 and the completion 
of the Transcontinental Railroad in 1869 expanded U.S. commercial and military interest in 
the kingdom of Hawaii. Trans-Pacifi c steamship lines that began at the Pacifi c docks where 
the railroad ended sought fueling stations on their way to Asia, and Hawaii’s Pearl Harbor 
was the perfect stopping place. At the same time, American-owned sugar plantations had 
become a major economic force in Hawaii. Native Hawaiians, who were now a minority 
within their own country and controlled perhaps 15 percent of the land and 2 percent of the 
capital, did not want to further U.S. infl uence in their country, but the Hawaiian government 
agreed that it would not grant special trading rights or naval bases to any other country in 
return for a promise that Hawaii could ship a steady supply of sugar duty-free to the United 
States. Hawaii’s King Kalakaua visited the United States in 1874 to formalize the agreement. 
By the 1880s, American economic power in Hawaii was overwhelming, but the 
islands remained independent. When King Kalakaua died, his sister Queen Liliuokalani 
succeeded him. She sought to regain “Hawaii for the Hawaiians” and reduce the economic 
and political power of the United States. Most of the American planters on the 
island did not like the queen’s moves and formed the Annexation Club.” In 1893, the 
annexation group overthrew her and seized power. Th e U.S. minister in Hawaii, John 
L. Stevens, cabled Washington, “Th e Hawaiian pear is now fully ripe and this is the 
golden hour for the United States to pluck it.” Th e U.S. Navy landed sailors “to preserve 
order,” thus securing the queen’s overthrow. Hawaii would have been annexed to 
the United States if the recently inaugurated Democratic President Grover Cleveland 
had not sensed that there was something unseemly about the whole aff air and ended 
negotiations with the rebels. Cleveland announced his fi rm opposition to annexation.

Hawaii’s Queen Liliuokalani was overthrown in 
an uprising led by American planters. A century 
later, the U.S. government apologized to native 
Hawaiians for this illegal act.

Under Cleveland, the United States might have supported Liliuokalani’s restoration 
had she not insisted that she would execute all of the rebels. Th at action was too much 
for Cleveland, and his administration ignored Hawaii, which continued as an independent 
nation under the control of the American planters who had overthrown the 
queen’s government. 
When William McKinley was elected president in 1896, he demonstrated none 
of Cleveland’s resistance to U.S. acquisition of Hawaii as the next step in the nation’s 
“Manifest Destiny.” McKinley said, “We need Hawaii as much…as in its day we needed 
California.” In June 1897, McKinley proposed a treaty of annexation, to which the planter 
government agreed. McKinley realized that anti-imperialists in the Senate could block the 
two-thirds vote required to approve the treaty, so the president used the same strategy that 
John Tyler had used half a century earlier for Texas. He asked both houses of Congress 
to annex the territory by joint-resolution, which required only a majority vote. By June 
1898, to the protests of native Hawaiians and the cheers of the planters, Hawaii became a 
permanent territory of the United States. In that same year, the United States annexed tiny 
Midway and Wake islands and, a year later, agreed to divide Samoa with Germany. Across 
the Pacifi c, Mahan’s dream of stations for the growing navy was a reality (see Map 20-1 ). 
Quick Review How did worry about other nations, as well as domestic events and developments 
in the United States, contribute to the nation’s interest in acquiring Alaska and 
Hawaii as new territories?

THE SPLENDID LITTLE WAR…WITH SPAIN—CUBA, PUERTO RICO, 
AND THE PHILIPPINES, 1898 
Analyze the causes and consequences of the U.S. War with Spain in 1898. 
Th e U.S. War with Spain in 1898 (oft en called the Spanish-American War) followed 
decades of U.S. expansionism—much of it expansion into territory that had previously 
been part of Spain’s once-vast empire in the Americas. Spain had at one time exercised 
political control of all of Latin America, except for Brazil, and it had ruled the 
Philippine Islands for centuries. As a result of success ful independence movements, all 
that was left of the Spanish empire in the 1890s was the Philippines and a collection of 
Caribbean islands. Many in Spain wanted to retain those outposts for their own value 
and as symbols of Spain’s past glory. Nevertheless, as a result of a short war—which 
future Secretary of State John Hay called “a splendid little war”—Spain lost the last 
of its holdings. Th e United States gained long-term infl uence in both Cuba and the 
Philippine Islands, and made Puerto Rico a permanent U.S. territory. 
Tensions in Cuba 
Th e U.S. War with Spain started in Cuba. Th e United States had long been interested 
in Cuba. Well before the Civil War, southern Senators had suggested that the United 
States ought to acquire Cuba as a slave state to off set the growing number of Northern 
free states. In 1854, the American ambassadors to Europe’s leading powers issued the 
so-called Ostend Manifesto, demanding that Spain sell Cuba to the United States, but 
it did not happen. Aft er the Civil War, Cuba was no longer of value as a slave state, 
but interest in the island never disappeared from American politics, and American 
investors were active there. By the 1890s, almost 90 percent of Cuban exports came 
to the United States, and American investors owned much of the best farm land on 
the island. 
Cubans wanted to throw off Spanish rule and win independence. An 1890 agreement 
with Spain had reduced the tariff on sugar, launching a boom in the Cuban economy, 
but a new U.S. tariff in 1894, strongly infl uenced by lobbying from the Sugar Trust 
in the United States, signifi cantly raised the tariff on imported sugar. Th e increased 
cost of Cuban sugar in the United States, signifi cantly reduced the sales of Cuban sugar 
and devastated the Cuban economy. Cuban revolutionaries led by José Martí, who had 
been living in exile in New York City, saw the resulting Cuban depression as the ideal 
moment to gain independence. Martí returned to Cuba in 1895, and his revolutionary 
forces began burning cane fi elds, killing Spanish soldiers, and making Spanish rule 
more costly. Spanish authorities responded by creating concentration camps where 
they held Cubans in controlled enclaves that separated them from the rebels. Many in 
these camps suff ered from malnutrition and disease. 
When William McKinley was inaugurated as U.S. president in 1897, he made it 
clear that he wanted Spain out of Cuba. American public opinion was on the side of 
the rebels. New York newspaper editors William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer 
engaged in what was called “yellow journalism” (named for a popular cartoon character 
of the day known as the “Yellow Kid”), publishing sensationalized accounts of 
Spanish atrocities in Cuba. Th ey sent well-known artists like Frederic Remington, and 
writers like Richard Harding Davis, to Cuba to report on Spanish actions to increase 
circulation for their publications. 
While many Americans saw the Cuban revolution of the 1890s as a simple question 
of good Cubans against bad Spaniards, American business leaders with investments 
in Cuba also worried that a revolutionary victory would threaten their investments. 
Martí, while grateful for American support, worried about long-term American infl uence, 
insisting that, “To change masters is not to be free.”

Th e Spanish government in Madrid did not want a war with the United States, and 
they worried—correctly, it would turn out—that the government, and indeed the Spanish 
monarchy, could not survive the overthrow of the last bastion of Spain’s empire in the 
Americas. As U.S. public opinion became more belligerent, so did public opinion in Spain. 
Spanish people rallied to their fl ag, and in one town a mob attacked the U.S. consulate. 
War in Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippine Islands 
In February 1898, over 200 American sailors were killed when the battleship USS Maine 
blew up in Havana Harbor. Th e explosion may well have been the result of a bad boiler; 
however, Americans blamed Spain, and “Remember the Maine ” became a rallying cry. 
McKinley managed to get Congress to declare war without ever asking for it. 
Th e U.S. invasion of Cuba was not well managed. American troops arrived wearing 
wool uniforms—hardly the right material for a hot Caribbean summer. Even though 
Th eodore Roosevelt gained fame for leading mostly African-American troops (shown 
as white in subsequent pictures) in a rapid assault on San Juan Hill, the battles in Cuba 
were generally slow and diffi cult. In 4 months of fi ghting, 345 Americans were killed in 
action while 5,000 died from disease. 
Since the United States was at war with Spain, McKinley also approved the orders 
that had been issued by Assistant Secretary of the Navy Roosevelt (issued just before 
he resigned that position to fight in Cuba) to Admiral George Dewey to sail the 
U.S. fl eet to the Spanish-owned Philippine Islands. Th e six warships under Dewey’s 
command quickly sank the Spanish fl eet at the Battle of Manila Bay on May 1, 1898, 
giving the United States control of a Pacific territory much larger than Cuba. The 
American Pacifi c fl eet also captured the Spanish garrison on Guam Island and took 
control of the uninhabited atoll of Wake Island. 
Finally, the United States decided to take the last Spanish outpost in the Caribbean, 
Puerto Rico. Once control of Cuba seemed assured in July 1898, McKinley ordered 
General Nelson A. Miles to Puerto Rico. He wanted to be sure the troops arrived 
before peace talks began with Spain. In 1898, some Puerto Ricans welcomed the U.S. 
overthrow of Spanish authority, and the indigenous independence movement in 
Puerto Rico was not as strong as that in Cuba. 
By August 1898, Spain was ready to ask for peace. Much to 
McKinley’s displeasure, the congressional resolution authorizing 
the war had included the Teller Amendment, named for Senator 
Henry Teller of Colorado, which said the United States could not 
permanently annex Cuba. If the United States could not annex Cuba, 
Puerto Rico seemed like the next best permanent U.S. territory in the 
Caribbean. In the case of the Philippines, which had not been an initial 
focus of the war, McKinley felt that he could “see but one plain 
path of duty—the acceptance of the archipelago.” In the Treaty of 
Paris of December 1898, Spain ceded control of Cuba, Puerto Rico, 
and the Philippines to the United States for a payment of $20 million. 
Aft erward, the United States promised eventual independence 
for Cuba. Suddenly, the United States was a world power, joining the 
nations of Europe with its own far-fl ung empire. What to do with 
that empire would be a subject of considerable debate in the future. 
The Anti-Imperialists 
When the U.S. War with Spain ended, the United States had to decide what to do with 
its new territory. In spite of the Teller Amendment, President McKinley did everything 
possible to maximize U.S. involvement in Cuba, including ensuring that the U.S. Navy 
would have a perpetual base at Guantanamo Bay. Th e United States was going to keep 
Puerto Rico, but what about the distant Philippines? Th e war had begun and ended in the 
Caribbean over issues of Spanish control of Cuba; however, as part of the war, the United

States also found itself in control of a chain of seven thousand islands with 7 million people 
living thousands of miles from the United States. 
President McKinley told a group of visiting Episcopal clergy that he had lost sleep and 
had prayed long and hard about what to do with the islands and that the answer had come to 
him: “[T]here was nothing left for us to do but to take them all, and to educate the Filipinos, 
and uplift and civilize and Christianize them.” Th e United States could not give them back 
to Spain or another country and, he insisted, “they were unfi t for self-government.” 
Nearly all Filipinos were already Christian since Catholic Spain had ruled the 
islands for nearly 400 years, but McKinley meant Protestant Christianity. The 
Constitution might prohibit the government’s direct involvement with the religious 
beliefs of the Filipinos, but allowing missionaries was easy. 
A greater diffi culty with the president’s plan was the fact that many Filipinos did not 
want to be annexed by the United States. A revolt against Spain had been underway long 
before Commodore Dewey sank the Spanish fl eet in Manila Bay. In addition, Dewey 
had encouraged Emilio Aguinaldo, leader of the Filipino insurrection, to establish an 
interim government for the islands. Aguinaldo expected U.S. recognition of Philippine 
independence, and even aft er it became clear that this was not President McKinley’s 
plan, Aguinaldo hoped for either the defeat of McKinley’s treaty in the Senate or a victory 
in the 1900 presidential elections by William Jennings Bryan, who strongly opposed 
annexation of the Philippines. When the Senate ratifi ed the treaty with Spain and Bryan 
lost the election, Aguinaldo led a revolt against the United States. What the U.S. government 
called the “Philippine Insurrection,” Aguinaldo called a war for independence. 
Between 1898 and 1902, and beyond, the U.S. Army engaged in a brutal battle with 
Filipino insurgents. Many more American soldiers were killed in the postwar insurgency 
in the Philippine Islands than were killed in the war with Spain. Thousands 
of Filipinos were killed—perhaps 20,000 in combat and 200,000 from war-related 
causes—and many more left homeless.

Within the United States, broad-based opposition to the war in the Philippines 
was organized as the Anti-Imperialist League, founded at Boston in June 1898. Th e 
league included unlikely allies. Andrew Carnegie off ered to buy the islands from the 
United States to secure their independence and wrote to one member of McKinley’s 
cabinet, “You seem to have fi nished your work of civilizing the Filipinos; it is thought 
that about 8,000 of them have been completely civilized and sent to Heaven; I hope 
you like it.” Charles Francis Adams (descendent of two presidents), former abolitionist 
Th omas Wentworth Higginson, reformers including Jane Addams and Henry 
Demarest Lloyd, labor leaders including Samuel Gompers, rival Democrats William 
Jennings Bryan and Grover Cleveland, and university presidents like Harvard’s 
Charles W. Eliot and Stanford’s David Starr Jordan all opposed the annexation. 
Th e nation’s best-known authors, Mark Twain and William Dean Howells, turned 
biting humor on McKinley’s eff orts. Twain said that the U.S. eff orts in the Philippines 
meant that the United States had become “yet another Civilized Power, with its banner 
of the Prince of Peace in one hand and its loot-basket and its butcher-knife in the 
other.” Booker T. Washington said, “Until our nation has settled the Indian and the 
Negro problems, I do not think we have a right to assume more social problems.” 
Most anti-imperialists insisted that the Constitution did not allow for the United 
States to acquire any territories that it did not plan to eventually admit as states and 
that “the Constitution follows the fl ag” —meaning all of the civil and political rights 
guaranteed in the Constitution also applied to other people under U.S. control. Th e 
advocates of territorial expansion did not agree, and in May 1901, the U.S. Supreme 
Court in a series of 5-4 decisions in the Insular Cases declared that the Philippines and 
Puerto Rico were territories, not future states, and that therefore those residing there 
were “subjects” not “citizens.” It was a bitter moment for the anti-imperialists. 
While Roosevelt had been one of the staunchest advocates of going to war in 1898 
and of keeping control of the Philippine Islands aft er the war, by the time he became 
president in 1901, the U.S. eff ort was increasingly unpopular and he had other priorities. 
In 1901, the Army captured Aguinaldo. William Howard Taft , who had been 
governor general of the Philippines, was welcomed home, and a truce settled on the 
islands, though U.S. troops remained until the Japanese invasion at the start of World 
War II. United States attention turned elsewhere.

FOREIGN POLICY, FOREIGN ADVENTURES, 1900–1914 
Explain developments in U.S. policy in Panama, Asia, and Mexico between the U.S. War 
with Spain and World War I. 
When Theodore Roosevelt became president in September 1901, he inherited two 
major foreign policy issues from McKinley—the ongoing war in the Philippines, which 
he quickly put behind him, and the question of a Central American canal connecting 
the Atlantic and Pacifi c oceans, which he embraced with Rooseveltian enthusiasm. 
Roosevelt considered the Central American canal one of his proudest achievements. 
A Canal in Panama 
Ever since the California Gold Rush of 1848, there had been talk of building a canal 
across Central America that would allow shorter travel by ship from the Atlantic to 
the Pacifi c oceans, but the hurdles were signifi cant. Th e narrow point of land between 
North and South America was hot and damp, and mosquito-born diseases made working 
there a death sentence. Th e land was also mountainous, and for any canal to be 
built, engineers had to design a series of locks to raise and lower ships. Nevertheless,

in 1850, the United States and Britain negotiated the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty, stating 
that any canal would be a joint venture though neither controlled the territory. Fift y 
years later, few in the United States still wanted a joint venture with Britain, and in 
November 1901, Secretary of State John Hay and the British Ambassador to the United 
States, Lord Pauncefote, concluded a treaty that gave the United States the exclusive 
right to build an interocean waterway in Central America. McKinley had created an 
Isthmian Canal Commission that recommended building a canal in Nicaragua, but 
Roosevelt preferred a shorter route through Panama. 
The canal was not the first time Roosevelt involved the United States in Latin 
America. In 1902, shortly aft er he came to offi ce, the government of Venezuela held 
back on debt payments to European banks. Britain, Italy, and Germany sent ships to 
Venezuela, but Roosevelt, citing the Monroe Doctrine, pressured them to withdraw. 
A year later when the Dominican Republic seemed set to follow the same route as 
Venezuela, Roosevelt sent U.S. forces to the island and took control of its customs 
operation, dividing the revenue between the country and the European creditors, 
an involvement in the finances of the Dominican Republic that lasted until 1941. 
Th en in 1904, he formalized U.S. action in the Dominican Republic, announcing the 
“ Roosevelt Corollary ” to the Monroe Doctrine, stating that the United States had a 
right to intervene in any nation in the Americas that could not manage its own aff airs. 
Roosevelt’s greatest interest in Latin America, however, remained constant. 
He wanted a canal, and he wanted it built in the territory of Panama that then belonged 
to Colombia. Even though the government of Colombia did not agree, many in Panama 
saw the situation differently. Panama was a frontier province of Colombia, distant 
enough that it could take 15 days for messages from Panama City to reach the national 
government in Bogotá. Many in Panama were ready to declare independence. Th ere is 
no evidence that Roosevelt actively urged a revolution, but he certainly did nothing to 
discourage one either. In November 1903, when Panama revolted against Colombian 
rule, Roosevelt sent orders to U.S. Navy ships standing by on both the Pacific and 
Atlantic coasts of Panama to “prevent landing of any armed force with hostile intent, 
either government or insurgent.” Since the insurgents were already in Panama and the 
only forces that wanted to land were from the Colombian government, the impact of 
the order was clear. Describing the independence movement in Panama, Roosevelt told 
the U.S. Congress that the people of Panama had risen up against Colombia, “literally 
as one man.” Senator Edward Carmack retorted, “Yes, and the one man was Roosevelt.” 
Once Panama declared independence, the United States quickly—with “indecent 
haste,” one critic said—recognized the independent Panamanian government and then

proposed the canal to them. Th ree months later in February 1904, both nations ratifi ed a 
treaty giving the United States the right to a canal zone 10 miles wide, which “the United 
States would possess…[as] if it were the sovereign of the territory”, while the new government 
in Panama City got the $10 million that had originally been off ered to Colombia. 
Roosevelt got the route he wanted, if not the good will of Latin America. 
Late in his term, Roosevelt visited Panama. Ever the energetic enthusiast, he climbed 
up to the driver’s seat of the biggest steam shovel digging the canal, spoke with some of 
the 19,000 West Indian laborers who were doing the backbreaking work (and who died 
at an astounding rate; 85 just in the month of the president’s visit), met with authorities 
of the new government, and envisioned ships passing through the canal and towns 
rising on the banks of what was still, at that point, a muck-fi lled ditch. Th e canal did 
not open until 1914, long aft er Roosevelt had left offi ce. With or without Roosevelt, the 
United States would most likely have built a canal between the oceans at some point. 
Nevertheless, the route and the speed were a result of Roosevelt’s eff orts. 
The United States, Russia, Japan, and China 
Across the world, Russia had long been expanding its territory. Russian Cossacks had 
asserted control of Asian Siberia for Russia in the 1600s and then looked west to North 
America and south in Asia. All Russian expansion came to an abrupt halt in early 
1904, however. Japan, which had emerged as a modern military and diplomatic power, 
was determined to stop Russia from acquiring infl uence in Manchuria and Korea. Th e 
Japanese fl eet under Admiral Heihachiro Togo attacked and destroyed a Russian fl eet 
anchored at Port Arthur. To America, the war seemed far away, and the United States 
quickly declared neutrality. A year later in May 1905, another Russian fl eet was destroyed. 
Th e Japanese Navy sank twenty-two Russian ships, killed some 4,000 Russian sailors, and 
captured several more ships along with the Russian commander Admiral Rozhdestvenski. 
Nevertheless, no peace treaty emerged, and Japanese resources were spent. 
Th e Japanese government sent a secret message to Roosevelt, asking if he would 
“directly and entirely of his own motion and initiative…invite the two belligerents to 
come together.” Roosevelt loved the idea of playing mediator and proposed arbitration 
to the tsar. Russia agreed, and the announcement of the peace conference won 
Roosevelt worldwide praise. 
Once Roosevelt got representatives of both countries to Portsmouth, New 
Hampshire, in August 1905, they argued about borders, money, and a postwar plan. 
But eventually, Roosevelt’s arm-twisting led to a peace agreement. Th e war ended, 
and Roosevelt was praised by the Russian tsar and the Japanese emperor. A year later, 
Roosevelt was rewarded with the Nobel Peace Prize. 
While the czarist government was grateful for Roosevelt’s role in ending the war, 
Russian immigrants to the United States had their own grievances against the tsar’s 
rule. When hundreds of Russian Jews were killed in pogroms between 1903 and 1906, 
Jewish immigrants in the United States pressured the U.S. government to do something 
about the situation, and President Roosevelt and Secretary of State John Hay 
issued a formal protest. Th e Russian ambassador responded to the protest saying that 
it was “unbecoming for Americans to criticize” Russia in light of American lynching 
of African-Americans and the bad treatment of Chinese immigrants. 
Japan, too, though appreciative of Roosevelt’s eff orts to mediate with Russia, was not 
pleased by San Francisco’s segregation of Japanese students. California was the port of 
entry for immigrants from Japan and China. It was also the place where anti-Asian feelings 
ran strongest. In October 1906, in the aft ermath of the city’s great earthquake, as they 
reorganized and reopened the city’s schools, the San Francisco School Board adopted a 
policy of racial segregation for Chinese, Korean, and Japanese children. Th e government 
of China protested but was too weak to do more. In Japan, however, anger at the insult led 
to calls for war. Roosevelt tried to convince Californians to rescind the segregation order 
while encouraging the government of Japan to ignore the insult, but failed at doing both.

However, in 1907 and 1908, he successfully negotiated the Gentlemen’s Agreement by 
which the United States agreed not to pass any formal limit on Japanese immigration and 
the Japanese government agreed to limit the emigration of laborers to the United States. 
For Japan, it was important not to face anything as insulting as the Chinese Exclusion Act 
of 1882 had been. For Californians, Roosevelt had accomplished the goal of establishing 
a limit on Japanese immigration. At the same time, Roosevelt used Japan’s threat of war 
to ask Congress to appropriate funds to expand the U.S. Navy and then sent the Great 
White Fleet —16 battleships painted gleaming white rather than navy grey—around the 
world with a dramatic stop at Tokyo Bay. Th e 1908 tensions with Japan had receded, 
though they were hardly ended. 
In China, tensions were also rising against the United States. The Society of 
Righteous and Harmonious Fists, (called Boxers by foreigners) a secret society consisting 
of local farmers, peasants, and others who were victims of disastrous fl oods 
and opium addiction, led the Boxer Rebellion in 1901, attacking all foreigners, including 
American businessmen and missionaries, whom they blamed for their plight. 
Although the Boxer Rebellion was quickly quashed by an international force, Chinese 
citizens, carrying anti-American posters and singing anti-American songs, organized 
a massive boycott of U.S. goods in 1905. 
Woodrow Wilson’s Asian Policy 
While he was president, Th eodore Roosevelt had insisted that the long-standing Open 
Door Policy allowing the United States and Britain free trade with China be continued 
in spite of Japan’s desire to dominate all Asian markets. President Taft had less loft y goals 
for America’s role in the world, and though he was wary of political ties, he strongly 
encouraged American investment wherever there was an opportunity, leading critics 
to call his policy dollar diplomacy . Late in Taft ’s term, J.P. Morgan negotiated a large 
international loan to China to support the building of new rail lines there. Upon becoming 
president, Woodrow Wilson found himself immediately involved with Asian matters 
and specifi cally the Morgan loan. Wilson’s new secretary of state, William Jennings 
Bryan, had deep reservations about the loan. Within 2 weeks of the inauguration, Wilson 
announced that the government of the United States opposed the loan because its terms 
undermined “the administrative independence of China.” China did not get the loan. 
Unfortunately, it also did not get the railroads that the loan was supposed to fi nance, 
something that weakened the country in its future dealings with Japan. 
Tensions with Japan that had been brewing since Roosevelt’s time continued. Just as 
Wilson assumed offi ce, the California legislature adopted a law that no one “ineligible for 
citizenship” could buy land in California. Since Japanese immigrants could not become 
citizens, everyone knew at whom the law was directed. Secretary Bryan made two trips to 
California to try and get the law rescinded, but failed. Japan’s government reacted angrily, 
as it had with school segregation in 1906, and again a war seemed possible. Wilson and 
Bryan did everything they could to diff use the situation. Th e leaders in Tokyo also did 
not want a war, but in Japan, feelings of deep anti-American animosity were furthered by 
California’s continuing determination to marginalize Japanese immigrants. 
Wilson and Bryan also tried to end U.S. control of the Philippines. Th ey convinced 
Congress to pass legislation granting eventual independence to the islands, but 
Republican opponents succeeded in deleting any specifi c deadline. Only aft er World 
War II did the United States recognize the independence of the Philippines, though it 
had been promised in 1916. 
Mexico and Latin America 
Th e most diffi cult foreign policy issue for Wilson in his fi rst term involved Mexico. In 
February 1913, just before Wilson’s inauguration, Mexican army general Victoriano 
Huerta led a military coup against the elected moderate, President Francisco Madero, 
who was killed in the bloody overthrow. Many American investors wanted the U.S. government 
to support the new Huerta administration, but Wilson announced, “We can

have no sympathy with those who seek the power of government to advance their own 
personal interests or ambitions.” Wilson and Bryan believed that the coup was part of a 
battle between British and American oil companies, and they wanted none of it. 
Wilson desperately wanted to let Mexico work out its own future. As he told the 
journalist Ray Stannard Baker, he “felt shame as an American over the fi rst Mexican 
war” of 1848. He continued that it was “his resolution that while he was president 
there should be no such predatory war.” He also believed that a people had the right 
“to do as they damned pleased with their own aff airs.” Baker added that the president 
did, indeed, use the word damned . 
In spite of the president’s intentions, Americans had major investments in Mexico, 
and thousands of American citizens worked in Mexico as teachers, nurses, and construction 
workers. Wilson could not ignore the country, and he sent envoys to try to 
persuade Huerta to resign, but failed. He spoke passionately about “the self-restraint of 
a really great nation.” When a revolution against Huerta led by Venustiano Carranza 
and Francisco “Pancho” Villa broke out, Wilson recognized it. In April of 1914, when 
Wilson got word that a large shipment of European arms for Huerta’s government was 
on its way to the Mexican port of Veracruz, Wilson ordered the Navy to land at the port 
and stop the arms. Th e arms were stopped, but to Wilson’s surprise, Mexico did not welcome 
the intervention, Mexican forces fought the U.S. Marines, and 17 Americans were 
killed. Not only Huerta but also Carranza condemned what they called a U.S. invasion. 
Th e end result was good for Carranza. Without the new arms, Huerta resigned and went 
into exile, and Carranza rode into Mexico City as the victor. Argentina, Brazil, and Chile 
agreed to negotiate a solution, and the Americans withdrew from Veracruz. 
Unfortunately, a new civil war began in Mexico when Villa split with Carranza. 
In March 1916, Villa, who was now leading a full-scale revolt, led several hundred troops 
in an attack on the U.S. border town of Columbus, New Mexico. Th ey wanted arms that 
were stored at nearby U.S. Army Fort Furlong, but more important, the wily Villa wanted 
to create an international incident. He did not get the arms, but he did get the incident. 
Wilson notifi ed Carranza of his intention to respect Mexican sovereignty, but also 
ordered the U.S. Army, under General John J. Pershing, to enter Mexico and fi nd Villa.

Carranza had much to benefi t from eliminating Villa and stayed out of the battle. Some 
10,000 U.S. troops under Pershing’s command were well-equipped with motor vehicles 
and airplanes, but they never found Villa though they engaged in some bloody battles 
as they chased him through northern Mexico for months. Eventually in early 1917, 
as Wilson became more and more concerned with the war in Europe, the U.S. forces 
withdrew without success, and Villa survived until he was assassinated in 1923. 
The United States intervened in several other Latin American matters during 
Wilson’s administration (see Map 20-2). Bryan off ered an apology to Colombia for 
the U.S. role in the revolution that had separated Panama and negotiated a $25 million 
payment to Colombia. Roosevelt was furious at an obvious slap at his administration, 
and his friend Henry Cabot Lodge blocked authorization of the funds in the Senate. 
Th e United States sent Marines to end unrest in Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, 
and Haiti; they stayed in Haiti until 1934. For all of their talk of nonintervention, 
Wilson and Bryan seemed quite willing to intervene in the Americas.

THE UNITED STATES AND THE GREAT WAR 
Analyze the causes and consequences of U.S. involvement in World War I. 
Just aft er the November 1912 election, while he was still living in Princeton, President- 
Elect Wilson told one of his former faculty colleagues, “It would be an irony of fate if 
my administration had to deal chiefl y with foreign problems, for all my preparation has 
been in domestic matters.” It was an irony that would come to pass with a vengeance. 
War in Europe 
On June 28, 1914, the Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir apparent to the 
throne of the Austria-Hungarian Empire, and his wife, Sophie, were assassinated in 
the town of Sarajevo by a Serbian nationalist who wanted independence for Serbia. 
Nothing could have seemed as far removed from the United States than the murder of 
members of a central European royal family. However, within a very short time, the 
impact of the assassination was felt everywhere in the world. 
In the summer of 1914, Europe was at peace. Even so, independence movements 
within the Austria-Hungarian and Ottoman Empires, particularly in Balkan states 
(including Serbia), were challenging the empires’ central governments (see Map 20-3). 
In addition, a newly united Germany was angry at being shut out of the colonies in 
Africa and Asia by the speed with which the British and French had moved. An arms 
race had developed among the continent’s greatest powers, and in their quest for security, 
European nations had developed a complex series of defensive alliances. Germany, 
Austria-Hungary, and the Turkish Ottoman Empire were known as the Central Powers. 
Russia, France, and Great Britain were known simply as the Allies. All of these factors 
quickly led Europe to tumble into all-out war when Austria set out to punish Serbia and 
Russia came to the aid of the Serbians. By August, all of Europe was engulfed in what 
was called the Great War. (Th e term World War I was coined only aft er the outbreak of 
another great war in 1939, one which quickly came to be known as World War II.) 
At the beginning of the war, many Europeans were caught up in patriotic fervor. 
Young men signed up promptly and marched off proudly. Both sides expected an easy 
victory. Th e German army attacked France by moving through neutral Belgium. It 
was a move that cost Germany dearly in public support, but it allowed the German 
army to get within 30 miles of Paris early in the war. Th en an allied counteroff ensive 
drove the Germans back, and by November 1914, both sides were dug in for the 
long trench warfare that would not move very much—though every small move cost 
thousands of soldiers their lives—until March of 1918. Th e long years of trench warfare 
were ghastly. In 1916 at the Battle of the Somme, 60,000 British soldiers were 
killed in a single day. In a year-long battle for the town of Verdun, a million soldiers 
were killed. New forms of artillery, tanks, and fl amethrowers, along with the introduction 
of poisonous mustard gas, caused what seemed like never-ending waves of death 
while life in the trenches involved living for months with mud, rats, and rotten food. 
Despite these costs, the battle lines did not change signifi cantly. Wilson called it “this 
vast gruesome contest of systematized destruction.” 
The United States saw all of these developments as a distant tragedy. A young 
American mining engineer, Herbert Hoover, organized the Commission for Belgian 
Relief, which along with the American Red Cross, sent aid to people caught in the path 
of war. Hoover gained international fame as the “Napoleon of mercy,” for his eff orts. 
However, most Americans preferred not to get involved and agreed with U.S. ambassador 
to London Walter Hines Page, who said, “I thank Heaven for many things—fi rst 
the Atlantic Ocean.” President Wilson declared neutrality. He wanted to stay out of 
the war, and he understood that any European war would stir up deep tensions in a 
nation made up of immigrants from every one of the nations at war. Neutrality, however, 
would not be easy to maintain.

Th e warfare on land and on the oceans around Europe cut into U.S. trade, hurting 
wheat farmers and cotton growers who could not get their goods to European markets. 
Britain began to place large orders for farm products and for munitions while using its 
powerful navy to maintain a blockade of the Central Powers. War-torn Britain needed 
money to buy these things, but when J.P. Morgan began to fl oat large loans, Secretary 
of State Bryan imposed a ban on loans to belligerents, seeking the “true spirit” of strict 
neutrality. Bryan’s ban hurt U.S. commerce, and Britain and France claimed it was 
prejudicial toward them, so Bryan and Wilson announced that “commercial credit” 
could be extended to the allies. No one understood the diff erence between “commercial 
credit” and loans, but the distinction allowed the European allied powers to get 
the goods they wanted, U.S. farmers and manufacturers to profi t, and everyone to pretend 
that neutrality was still maintained. 
Th e Wilson administration had to steer a diffi cult course while facing considerable 
internal pressures. Former president Roosevelt urged massive buildup of the army

and navy as well as a military draft , all in the name of preparedness for an eventual 
war on the side of the British and French. From Roosevelt’s perspective, Wilson was 
dangerously passive. 
In contrast, Progressive Senator Robert La Follette of Wisconsin and other politicians, 
especially those from states with large German populations led a peace movement, 
fearing that Wilson was edging toward war. Jane Addams led a large woman’s 
movement for peace. Many union leaders saw the war as a battle between European 
capitalists in which the working class should not be involved. Anarchists and socialists 
condemned the war. Between 1914 and 1916, in spite of Roosevelt’s best eff orts to 
build support for preparedness and war, most Americans in and out of offi ce favored 
keeping as far distant from Europe’s problems as possible. 
Of the many diplomatic tensions that the war in Europe created, by far the greatest 
had to do with the German use of a new kind of sea power—the submarine, or U-boat. 
Britain’s navy ruled the waves, but German U-boats could glide under the waves and 
strike at ships bringing supplies to Britain and France. On February 4, 1915, the German 
Admiralty announced that the waters around Britain were a “war zone” and its submarines 
would freely attack any ship bringing supplies to Britain. Wilson and Bryan sent a 
formal diplomatic note that sinking ships without warning was “an act so unprecedented 
in naval warfare” that the United States would hold them to “a strict accountability for 
such acts.” No one defi ned what “strict accountability” meant. Somehow, submarine 
warfare—having a ship struck by a torpedo seemingly out of nowhere— terrifi ed people 
in a way that direct ship-to-ship combat did not. Submarine warfare also threatened 
the profi table U.S. trade with Britain. For Wilson, it also raised the issue of basic rights 
of U.S. citizens, as neutrals, to travel freely. On the last point, the president and his secretary 
of state diff ered strongly. Bryan asked “whether an American citizen can, by putting 
his business above his regard for his country, assume for his own advantage unnecessary 
risk and thus involve his country in international complications.” For Wilson, the freedom 
of neutrals to travel was “in the interests of mankind,” and protecting the rights of 
neutrals under international law was a national duty. 
In March 1915, a submarine sank a small British passenger ship, the Falaba, and 
an American citizen was killed. Th en on May 7, 1915, a submarine sank the British 
liner Lusitania, the grandest and fastest ocean liner then in service. Th e Lusitania sank 
in 18 minutes and 1,198 people were killed, including 127 American citizens. The 
United States demanded an apology from Germany. When Bryan suggested also issuing 
a formal warning to American citizens not to travel on ships belonging to countries 
that were at war, Wilson refused. 
In response to the American note, the German government sent secret orders to 
its submarine captains to avoid large passenger liners, but their offi cial word to the 
United States was evasive. Wilson promised that if Germany would give up submarine 
warfare, he would also press Britain to end the blockade of goods fl owing to Germany 
and Austria, but he also prepared a second note to Germany saying that the sinking of 
the Lusitania involved “principles of humanity.” 
Bryan argued for protesting the British blockade and for linking the second note to 
a policy that would bar passenger ships from carrying munitions (the Lusitania may 
well have been carrying munitions in addition to passengers). Wilson thought that 
Bryan’s plan would undermine the needed message of protest. Bryan resigned rather 
than sign the second Lusitania note. He told the president that he was risking war by 
creating a situation where a foolish move by the German government could drag the 
United States into a war and that he could do more for peace building public opinion 
outside the administration than within. Bryan’s departure was a sad parting between 
two people who had come to like and admire each other but who deeply believed in 
diff erent courses of action. Robert Lansing became acting secretary and signed the 
note. Congress debated but did not pass a law barring Americans from travel on belligerent 
ships. Sinkings and diplomatic notes continued, as did American domestic 
politics and new developments in Woodrow Wilson’s personal life. 
Especially before the United States entered World 
War I, songs like “I Didn’t Raise My Boy to Be a 
Soldier” were popular among many who did not 
want to see young American men caught up in 
the fi ghting.

In the summer of 1914, as Europe began to move toward war, Ellen Wilson, the 
president’s wife of 30 years whose warmth off set Wilson’s sometimes dour personality, 
became desperately ill. Her kidneys were failing, and through the summer, the 
president read diplomatic cables while sitting by his wife’s bedside. She died at the 
White House at the beginning of August. Th e president wrote, “I never understood 
before what a broken heart meant.” Less than a year later, Wilson met a vivacious 
42-year-old widow named Edith Bolling Galt and quickly fell in love. Although some 
in the cabinet worried about how the public would respond to a new marriage so 
quickly aft er the loss of his fi rst wife, the two were married in December 1915. Th e 
nation had a new First Lady who would support Wilson and have a signifi cant role in 
policy as war and illness later sapped his energy. 
While Wilson was seeking to maintain neutrality and dealing with his personal 
life, 1916 was also an election year. Aft er Ellen’s death, he had seriously considered not 
running, but his new personal life and his desire to see the diplomatic crisis through 
led him to declare his candidacy for a second term. Th e Republican Party was reunited 
and nominated Supreme Court Justice Charles Evans Hughes. Hughes had served two 
terms as governor of New York, but he had also been on the Supreme Court since 1910 
and thus sat out the Roosevelt-Taft split. Roosevelt called him “the bearded iceberg,” 
but campaigned strongly for the ticket as did Taft . It was a very close contest, but in 
the end, Wilson carried California by 4,000 votes and, with it, the Electoral College. 
A month aft er the election Wilson tried to broker a peace between Europe’s warring 
powers. He asked both sides for their demands. Germany indicated that it was 
willing to discuss peace, but a new British government led by Prime Minister Lloyd 
George said it had no interest in American mediation. Then in December, Lloyd 
George indicated willingness to talk while the Germans backed off . In the midst of 
this diplomacy, the German government made two fateful mistakes. On January 31, 
1917, it announced to the United States that it was resuming “the full employment of 
all the weapons…at its disposal.” At the same time, German Foreign Minister Arthur 
Zimmermann sent a secret cable to the German embassy in Mexico with an off er to 
the Carranza government—long estranged from Wilson and the United States—that 
if it would attack the United States, Germany would see to the restoration of the territory 
from Texas to California that had been taken from Mexico in 1848. 
Th e British government managed to intercept and decode the Zimmermann telegram 
and release it to the public, turning much of American public opinion against 
Germany. Wilson was more concerned with unrestricted submarine warfare than 
any interference from Carranza. He broke diplomatic relations with Germany. He 
then asked Congress for authority to arm merchant ships, but La Follette and other 
Republican Progressives blocked the bill in the Senate. Wilson called them “a little 
group of willful men” and claimed the authority to arm the ships on executive authority. 
At the same time, other Americans, including former President Roosevelt were 
pressing Wilson to do more for Britain. As early as January 1915, Roosevelt, although 
out of offi ce, wrote to British Foreign Minister Sir Edward Grey, calling Wilson’s lack 
of greater support for the British “very obstinate.” Roosevelt thought Wilson was 
stumbling in 1915 and was ready to march. In the end, when war came, it brought 
Roosevelt political and personal tragedy. Wilson would accept neither his advice to 
help Britain nor his off er of service, and in July 1918, Roosevelt’s beloved son Quentin 
was killed in combat in France. 
From the German perspective, an immediate attack on supplies going to Britain 
and France was the only way to win the war. If they could block food and munitions 
from getting to the allies, then the Germans believed they could win the war before the 
United States could organize itself to do much harm. In March, U-boats sank three 
U.S. merchant ships with the loss of 15 American lives. As Bryan had warned, Wilson’s 
hard line meant that Germany had the initiative. Th e president felt he had run out of 
options. On April 2, 1917, Wilson appeared before a joint session of Congress and 
asked for a declaration of war against Germany.

The War at Home—Support and Opposition 
Not everyone was convinced by Wilson’s eloquence. In the Senate, Wisconsin’s La 
Follette and George Norris of Nebraska led the opposition to a declaration of war. 
Norris, a Republican long part of the Progressive movement, said, “We have loaned 
many hundreds of millions of dollars to the allies in this controversy.” And he saw the 
war as simply a way to defend those loans, insisting, “We are going into war upon the 
command of gold.” He would have none of it. When the vote came, six Senators, three 
Republican and three Democrats, opposed the war. In the House, 50 Representatives 
voted no on the war resolution. Th e most dramatic vote came from Jeannette Rankin 
of Montana. Rankin was the only woman in the House, elected at a time when women 
in most states still did not have the vote. She was under intense pressure from some 
suff ragists, who planned to demand votes for patriotic women as a war measure, to 
vote for the war, but in the roll call Rankin answered, “I want to stand by my country, 
but I cannot vote for war. I vote no.” (In 1941, after a long absence, Rankin would 
W ilson had spoken directly to Congress many times before. 
Nevertheless, when he decided that the United States needed 
to go to war on the side of Britain and France the words took on a 
new level of importance. Everyone knew what he would ask, but 
they waited to hear his reasons. 
Gentlemen of the Congress: 
On the 3d of February last I officially laid before you 
the extraordinary announcement of the Imperial German 
Government that on and after the 1st day of February it was 
its purpose to put aside all restraints of law or of humanity and 
use its submarines to sink every vessel that sought to approach 
either the ports of Great Britain and Ireland or the western coasts 
of Europe…. Vessels of every kind, whatever their flag, their character, 
their cargo, their destination, their errand, have been ruthlessly 
sent to the bottom without warning and without thought 
of help or mercy for those on board, the vessels of friendly neutrals 
along with those of belligerents.… 
With a profound sense of the solemn and even tragical character 
of the step I am taking and of the grave responsibilities 
which it involves, but in unhesitating obedience to what I deem 
my constitutional duty, I advise that the Congress declare the 
recent course of the Imperial German Government to be in fact 
nothing less than war against the Government and people of 
the United States; that it formally accept the status of belligerent 
which has thus been thrust upon it.… 
What this will involve is clear. It will involve the utmost practicable 
cooperation in counsel and action with the governments 
now at war with Germany.…It will involve the organization and 
mobilization of all the material resources of the country to supply 
the materials of war.…It will involve the immediate full equipment 
of the Navy in all respects but particularly in supplying it 
with the best means of dealing with the enemy’s submarines. It 
will involve the immediate addition to the armed forces of the 
United States already provided for by law in case of war at least 
500,000 men, who should, in my opinion, be chosen upon the 
principle of universal liability to service.…It will involve also, of 
course, the granting of adequate credits to the Government, sustained, 
I hope, so far as they can equitably be sustained by the 
present generation, by well conceived taxation.… 
One of the things that has served to convince us that the 
Prussian autocracy was not and could never be our friend is that 
from the very outset of the present war it has filled our unsuspecting 
communities and even our offices of government with 
spies and set criminal intrigues everywhere afoot against our 
national unity.…That it means to stir up enemies against us at 
our very doors the intercepted note to the German Minister at 
Mexico City is eloquent evidence.… 
The world must be made safe for democracy. Its peace must 
be planted upon the tested foundations of political liberty. We 
have no selfish ends to serve. We desire no conquest, no dominion. 
We seek no indemnities for ourselves, no material compensation 
for the sacrifices we shall freely make. We are but one of 
the champions of the rights of mankind.

be on the fl oor of Congress again and would be the single no vote against U.S. entry 
into World War II.) Once the United States was formally at war, the previous antiwar 
constituency split between those including Bryan, who believed that once the United 
States had made the decision to go to war everyone should support the war eff ort, and 
others—from Jane Addams to Eugene V. Debs to Emma Goldman—who continued to 
oppose the war no matter what the president asked or how the Congress voted. Despite 
the opposition, once the United States was formally at war in the spring of 1917, the 
Wilson administration set out to do everything possible to assure the support of every 
citizen. In his war speech Wilson had said, “If there should be disloyalty, it will be dealt 
with with a fi rm hand of stern repression.” He meant it. 
To build support for the war, Wilson created the Committee on Public 
Information (CPI) and appointed the respected progressive journalist George Creel 
as its head. No one could challenge Creel’s progressive credentials as a muckraker, 
supporter of women’s rights, and political reformer. Creel rejected crude propaganda, 
insisting that “[a] free people cannot be told what to think. Th ey must be given the 
facts and permitted to do their own thinking.” Creel also insisted that he and the 
Wilson administration would be the ones to decide what “facts” to give people and, 
more seriously, what alternative “facts” should be blocked. 
Creel announced, “It was a fi ght for the minds of men, for the ‘conquest of their 
convictions,’ and the battle-line ran through every home in the country.” Under his 
leadership, the CPI hired other muckraking journalists, including Ray Stannard Baker 
and Ida Tarbell, and published 75 million pamphlets supporting the U.S. war eff ort. 
Th ey recruited 75,000 “Four Minute Men,” volunteers who were ready to speak at 
a moment’s notice in favor of the war eff ort and against Germany at any theater or 
neighborhood meeting. He worked with the still-new movie studios to create fi lms 
like Th e Kaiser: Beast of Berlin . Creel’s CPI launched a special “War Americanization 
Plan” to encourage foreign-born immigrants, especially those from the Central 
Powers, to buy Liberty Bonds and otherwise assert their American patriotism. He also 
hired Charles Dana Gibson, famous for creating the nation’s model of feminine beauty 
in the “Gibson Girl,” to produce prowar posters that would glorify the American war 
eff ort and call on all Americans to purchase war bonds and tend home vegetable gardens—
or victory gardens—as well as for young men to serve in the army. Th e government 
also launched “war study courses” to encourage patriotism and loyalty among 
public school students. Creel was confident enough of his efforts that he opposed 
more blatant limitations on civil liberties. Aft er the war, he wrote, “Better far to have 
the desired compulsions proceed from within than to apply them from without.” 
Herbert Hoover, who had gained fame organizing support for people in war ravaged 
Belgium, became the head of the U.S. Food Administration and urged Americans 
to support the war by eating less and conserving more so that food could be sent to the 
troops or the Allies. Like Creel, Hoover believed that voluntary compliance was most 
eff ective, so he rejected rationing in favor of what he described as mobilizing “the 
spirit of self-denial and self-sacrifi ce in this country.” People got the widely touted 
message, “FOOD WILL WIN THE WAR—DON’T WASTE IT.” Th e federal government 
also created the Fuel Administration and the War Industries Board and took 
direct control of the nation’s railroads. Most of the new agencies were led by business 
executives, and the criticism of business leaders that had characterized Wilson’s fi rst 
term virtually disappeared as the nation’s corporate elite became essential supporters 
of the war eff ort. 
While Creel led the government’s “fi ght for the minds” of the American people 
and Hoover tried to change their eating habits, other self-styled patriots had their own 
agendas. Th e nongovernmental American Protective League (APL), which eventually 
grew to 250,000 members, included some who had opposed German immigrants or 
domestic political radicals and who saw the war as a time to further their agenda. APL 
members, without government authority, opened mail and listened in on telephone 
calls, looking for spies and traitors. Fearing such animosity, many German-Americans

The U.S. government and private organizations 
like the Red Cross used advertising that had been 
eff ective in other sectors of American life to recruit 
Americans to support the war eff ort, as in this 
poster of a young woman summoning Americans 
to service.

were careful to demonstrate their loyalty. Th e Deutsches Haus of Indianapolis became 
the Athenaeum of Indiana; sauerkraut became liberty cabbage; and German language 
classes, schools, and newspapers were closed. On occasion, the split between those 
who supported and those who opposed U.S. involvement in the war turned violent. A 
few months aft er the United States entered the war, during the hot summer of 1917, 
some 2,000 members of the APL along with the sheriff of Bisbee, Arizona, raided a 
mass meeting of the Industrial Workers of the World—the large and radical union 
that strongly opposed the war—and rounded up over a thousand IWW members and 
supporters, a third of whom were Mexican-American, leaving them out on the desert 
without food or water for 2 days before letting them escape to New Mexico. A 
German-American, Robert Prager, was lynched by a mob in Collinsville, Illinois. An 
IWW organizer, Frank Little, was lynched in Butte, Montana, aft er he told striking 
copper miners that they were battling an “imperialist, capitalist war.” An editorial in 
the Washington Post said of the violence, “In spite of excesses such as lynching, it is a 
healthful and wholesome awakening in the interior of the country.” 
In 1917 and 1918, Congress passed several acts to control the country’s responses 
to the war, including the Sedition Act of 1918 and the Espionage Act of 1917, giving 
the government vast new powers to limit free speech and the press that had not been 
seen in the United States since the Alien and Sedition Acts of the John Adams administration. 
Th e Sedition Act of 1918 made illegal “uttering, printing, writing, or publishing 
any disloyal, profane, scurrilous, or abusive language about the government of 
the United States…or the military or naval forces of the United States.” Postmaster 
General Albert Burleson banned from the U.S. mail anything that he thought violated 
the act. Attorney General Th omas W. Gregory and his successor A. Mitchell Palmer 
prosecuted violators or left it to local U.S. attorneys to do so. 
In spite of government policies and the eff orts of many in organizations like the 
APL to force all Americans to support the war, dissenters continued to speak out. 
Jane Addams, leader of the Women’s Peace Party as well as Chicago’s Hull House, 
spoke to the City Club of Chicago just aft er war had been declared, saying, “Th at the 
United States has entered the war has not changed my views of the invalidity of war as 
a method of settlement of social problems a particle, and I can see no reason why one 
should not say what one believes in time of war as in time of peace….” Her words were 
greeted only by silence from the club women. Th e National Federation of Settlements, 
which Addams had helped to found, said, “It has been very painful to many of us who 
hold Miss Addams in deep aff ection and wholly respect her, to fi nd that we cannot 
think or act in unison with her.” 
Jane Addams continued to oppose the war and seek international mediation to end 
it. She not only wanted the United States out of the war but also wanted to end the war 
wherever it was fought. At the same time, Addams, ever the practical settlement house 
leader, sought to ensure that there was “bread in time of war,” no matter who needed 
to eat. She happily cooperated with the U.S. government’s Food Administration 
though she objected to its slogan, “Food Will Win the War.” Nevertheless Addams 
urged residents of Chicago to plant vegetable gardens and consume less so that more 
could be sent to those in greatest need. 
While Addams was snubbed for her antiwar stance, others paid a much higher 
price. Radical leaders were watched carefully for “unpatriotic” words and actions. 
Over a hundred IWW and Socialist Party leaders were arrested and jailed on charges 
of violating the Sedition Act. In June 1918, Eugene V. Debs told a huge rally in 
Canton, Ohio, “I realize that, in speaking to you this aft ernoon, there are certain limitations 
placed upon the right of free speech.” But Debs also made it clear that he was 
equally as opposed to the leadership of Germany as to that of the Allies for, he said, 
all sides were using working people to fi ght their battles. So he continued, “Th e master 
class has always declared the wars; the subject class has always fought the battles.” In 
particular, he added, “[T]he working class who make the supreme sacrifi ces, the working 
class who freely shed their blood and furnish the corpses, have never yet had a

voice in either declaring war or making peace. It is the ruling class that invariably does 
both.” Debs was arrested for the speech and sentenced to 10 years in prison under the 
Espionage Act of 1917. 
War and Victory 
Many of those who supported U.S. entry into the war assumed that the country would 
limit its role to patrolling the oceans and providing material to the Allies. But once 
Wilson led the nation to war, he wanted full-scale involvement just as he had told the 
Congress. He was determined to defeat Germany and to win a place for himself at the 
table of the peace negotiations that he knew must come at the war’s end. 
General John J. Pershing, fresh from the failed effort to find Villa in Mexico, 
became the commander of the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) in large part 
because he had kept silent when others were criticizing Wilson’s lack of early preparation 
for war. Wilson refused an off er by former President Roosevelt to raise his own 
all-volunteer unit. Pershing’s orders were to work closely with the British and French 
while protecting the separate identity of the American forces. 
Deciding to send troops to fi ght in Europe was one thing. Actually getting an army 
raised and across the ocean was quite another. Over signifi cant opposition, Congress 
passed a military draft , and draft boards across the country began processing the notalways-
willing recruits. Training camps were set up. Regardless, it took time to raise 
and train an army. It also took both time and ships to get them across the Atlantic, and 
the United States was short on both. Since the Civil War, the U.S. merchant marine, 
needed to transport troops and supplies, had shrunk even as the navy had grown, and 
German attacks had reduced Britain’s shipping capacity signifi cantly. 
On July 4, 1917, a token force of “doughboys” as the American troops were called, 
paraded in France to enthusiastic acclaim. But it would be many months before large 
numbers of U.S. troops arrived in France and an even longer time before Pershing 
thought they were ready to fi ght. 
While the United States was raising, training, and transporting its army, the Allies 
came close to losing the war. Th e German government knew that it needed to win 
quickly before Americans arrived in force. In the long run, the United States had more 
people, and thus more potential soldiers, than any of the combatants except Russia.

20.3 Once the United States voted to go to war, most Americans 
supported the war effort, but a sizeable minority did not, 
and their claim to opposition under the free speech clause of the 
U.S. Constitution caused great tension. Many years later, Miriam 
E. Tefft, whose family supported the war, still remembered the 
fear when she was 15 years old and “the tragic hysteria which 
was World War I broke out in the copper mining camp of Bisbee, 
Arizona, where I lived and the citizens took over the law.” In Bisbee 
the IWW was leading a miner’s strike but since the union was also 
opposed to U.S. involvement in the war, the two issues—the right 
of the miners to strike and loyalty or opposition to the war effort, 
merged. “You could almost smell fear,” Tefft remembers. “Men 
didn’t look at each other in the face. Everyone was under suspicion. 
Loyalties were divided. One could sense an undercurrent of 
outrage seething.” Then on July 12, 1917, Tefft recalled seeing 
that the deputies and armed citizens were keeping the strikers 
in line as they were herded into the ball park behind the 
high board fence. The men had evidently been taken completely 
by surprise; some were still in their nightshirts, many 
in long underwear; some apparently hadn’t been given time 
to put on their shoes. “Where are they taking them?” people 
asked. A few days later the answer came. “The loads of strikers 
had been shipped to New Mexico, where they were turned 
out into the desert near Columbus.” 
Many other Americans were arrested and sent to jail under 
the Espionage Act. Charles Schenck mailed pamphlets urging 
people to resist the military draft and was convicted and sent 
to prison. Speaking to farmers in North Dakota, Kate Richards 
O’Hare said, “Any person who enlists in the army of the United 
States of America will be used for fertilizer,” and a federal judge 
sentenced her to 5 years in prison. Perhaps the most famous 
American to oppose the war, Eugene V. Debs, was sentenced to 
10 years in prison for his speech in Canton, Ohio. 
Schenck, O’Hare, Debs, and others appealed that their basic 
rights under the Constitution were being undermined. Some 
were eloquent in their testimony. O’Hare told the judge who 
sentenced her, 
I am dangerous to the war profiteers of this country who 
rob the people on the one hand and rob and debase the 
Government on the other…You can convince the people 
that I am dangerous to these men; but no jury and no judge 
can convince them that I am a dangerous woman to the best 
interests of the United States. 
Deb, in perhaps his best known statement, told the judge who 
was sentencing him: 
Your Honor, years ago I recognized my kinship with all living 
beings, and I made up my mind that I was not one but better 
than the meanest on earth. I said then, and I say now, that while 
there is a lower class, I am in it, while there is a criminal element 
I am of it, and while there is a soul in prison I am not free. 
Despite the eloquence, no courts overturned the Espionage Act 
convictions. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld enforcement of the 
Espionage Act. In the case of Charles Schenck, Schenck v. United 
States , Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote that Congress could 
limit free speech if the words “are used in such circumstances as 
are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger.” In 
Debs v. United States, the court upheld Debs’s conviction even 
though he had not urged violation of the draft laws. And later, 
when foreign-born opponents of the war were deported, the 
court upheld those rulings also. 
Finally, in the case of the IWW miners in Bisbee, Arizona, Tefft 
concluded, 
It was anticlimax when President Wilson, breathing fire and 
brimstone, sent a commission to investigate. The commission 
was headed by Felix Frankfurter [later appointed to the U.S. 
Supreme Court]. They found the government was helpless to 
punish anyone. No law could be found against kidnapping 
people en masse and dumping them in another state. 
Many Americans who did not agree with Debs or Addams were still 
appalled by the Wilson administration’s attacks on free speech and 
the court’s decisions. Samuel Gompers, president of the American 
Federation of Labor, supported the war but also condemned the 
attacks on other unionists, including on members of the IWW. 
Even Theodore Roosevelt criticized the president for the excessive 
force of the Espionage and Sedition Acts, which he called “sheer 
treason to the United States,” and dared Wilson to send him to jail 
because it “would make my voice carry farther.” After Wilson had 
left office, his successor, Warren Harding, pardoned Debs who had 
served some 2 years in federal prison. The country moved on, but 
the laws remained on the books.

Knowing that the Americans were coming, the British and French launched a major 
off ensive in the summer of 1917. As with previous eff orts, the off ensive was turned 
back, and the terrible losses led to mutinies throughout the French army. Th e Allied 
armies seemed to be losing the will to fi ght. 
On Germany’s eastern front, the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia in November 
1917 led to a new government that wanted nothing to do with the war. Th e Bolsheviks 
signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk which ended the war between Germany and Russia 
on German terms, the most important term of all being that Germany could now 
focus exclusively on the western front and attack France in the spring of 1918. 
Th e treaty did not come in time to save Germany, however. By 1918, 850,000 fresh 
U.S. troops had arrived, and they quickly went into combat, while the German troops 
were exhausted by 4 years of war. For the German soldiers, the fact that they were 
facing so many well-armed fresh troops undermined morale as much as any specifi c 
American victories, though those victories were not without importance. At Château- 
Th ierry in June of 1918, U.S. forces helped stop a German off ensive toward Paris. By 
that fall, the Americans were part of an Allied eff ort that had driven the German army 
out of France and back inside Germany. Th e end was becoming clear. An armistice 
was signed, and on November 11, 1918, at 11:00 a.m., the guns of Europe fell silent. 
Peace Talks, and the Failure of the Treaty of Versailles 
No one knows exactly how many were killed and wounded in World War I or how 
many more died of disease and exposure. By some estimates, as many as 65 million 
men fought, of whom 8 million were killed. In Europe, hardly a family escaped losing 
U.S. soldiers began arriving in France in the summer of 1918 and 
were quickly moved to the front lines. While presidents and 
generals planned, those doing the actual fighting—recent arrivals 
to war from farms and crowded city neighborhoods—told their 
own stories of fighting, fear, bravery, and sorrow, including this one 
recorded by Mathew Chopin while still in France, waiting for a ship 
home in early 1919. 
At early dawn we continued advancing “over the top” through 
clouds of gas and smoke—under rain of machine gun bullets, 
shrapnel and steel. The Huns [as most Americans called the 
Germans during the war] were shelling heavily the edge of the 
roadside. It was freezing cold; we were out of water and had just 
a small ration of salmon and hard-tack. Completely exhausted 
and thirsting for a drink, I remember grabbing a canteen from 
a passing artillery caisson to soothe my parched lips, when the 
explosion of a shell sent over deadly gas, getting four of our men. 
We got down in a valley for awhile during a machine gun barrage 
and then up again, firing away at the enemy as fast as our automatics 
could work.… 
So many of our men were getting wounded and as the litterbearer 
was killed while going out under fire for wounded, my 
sergeant sent me with another man to replace him. It was a dangerous 
situation going over rounds of Hell, as we had to go up 
and get them under machine gun and rifle fire.…We began picking 
up the wounded as fast as they came and bandaging those in 
need of first aid. It was a heartrending sight that weakened the 
strongest, for everywhere were wounded and lifeless forms— 
some all torn to pieces, their limbs and heads entirely severed 
from their bodies! I remember making a trip about a mile under 
heavy gun fire to get a wounded stretcher-bearer whose partner 
had been killed. He was a game little Yank, yet a pitiful sight, 
with his side all ripped open by shrapnel. As I laid him gently on 
the stretcher, I still remember his last uttered words, “Oh God, if I 
could only live to die at home!”

someone, and for a generation young women outnumbered young 
men by significant numbers. Ships were sunk, villages and towns 
destroyed, national economies wrecked. While some including Wilson 
wanted to use the end of the war to secure “a just and lasting peace,” 
others wanted vengeance, and still others wanted to forget all about 
war and simply have a good time in a life that they knew could be cut 
all too short. Amid all these confl icting political and emotional crosscurrents, 
leaders of the victorious nations met in Paris at the beginning 
of 1919 to write a peace treaty. 
Woodrow Wilson, who had broken precedent early in his term by 
speaking directly to Congress, broke precedent again when the war 
ended. He sailed for Paris to personally lead the American delegation 
at the Paris peace talks. No American President had ever left the 
United States while in offi ce, and some even wondered whether it was 
constitutional to do so. Wilson waived the concerns aside. Modern 
communications would allow him to remain in close touch with 
Washington while he was across the Atlantic. Th e British, French, and 
Italian Prime Ministers were all going to be present, and Wilson had 
no intention of handing the American role off to anyone else. 
When the president and Mrs. Wilson arrived in Brest, France, on 
December 13, 1918, they were greeted as heroes, and they continued 
to be honored as they toured France, Britain, and Italy. A banner on 
the Champs-Élysées in Paris announced, “Honor to Wilson the Just,” 
and an American newspaper reporter wrote, “No one ever had such 
cheers.” It must have been a satisfying moment for the war-weary 
president. For Wilson, one ominous cloud over the negotiations 
was the fact that Republicans had made substantial gains in the congressional elections 
of November 1918 in spite of his impassioned appeal to the voters to keep the 
Democrats in charge while he negotiated a treaty. Th en, while he was in France in 
January 1919, Wilson received a telegram that his arch-rival Th eodore Roosevelt had 
died. A reporter said he thought he saw a look of pity and then a smile of triumph on 
the president’s face, though Wilson was far too diplomatic to say anything. 
When the Paris peace talks convened at the old royal palace of Versailles, Wilson 
thought he was in a very strong bargaining position given the role of U.S. resources 
and troops in bringing the war to a successful conclusion for the allies. His counterparts 
thought diff erently. Georges Clémenceau, the tough 77-year-old French premier, 
wanted vengeance for France’s terrible losses, and British Prime Minister David Lloyd 
George, though more moderate than Clemenceau, harbored nothing like Wilson’s 
generous spirit. France and Britain had lost 10 to 20 times as many soldiers as the 
United States, most of the battles had been fought in France, and neither leader nor 
their followers were in any mood to be generous. Th e losers—Germany, Austria, and 
the Ottoman Empire—were excluded from the conference. Th e new communist government 
of Russia, which had signed its own separate treaty with Germany in early 
1918, was also excluded from the peace conference, and Wilson sent troops to try and 
support the overthrow of the communist government, which would lead to long-term 
tension between Russia and the United States. 
Since 1916, Wilson had been telling his fellow Americans what he wanted from a 
peace conference. He insisted the traditional U.S. isolationism could not continue and 
the nation must be willing to “become a partner in any feasible association of nations 
to maintain the peace.” In October, just before the presidential election, he told an 
audience in Omaha, Nebraska, “we are part of the world.” And in January 1917, he 
told the Senate that the United States wanted “peace without victory.” His goal was 
to avoid future wars based on the “covenant” of a new international organization that 
would ensure that “no such catastrophe shall ever overwhelm us again.” 
The peace talks at Versailles brought together a wide range of world 
leaders but were dominated by the leaders of Great Britain, France, and 
the United States.

In January 1918, as the United States went to war, Wilson outlined what came to 
be known as his Fourteen Points . Th e president said that America insisted on “open 
covenants of peace, openly arrived at.” Th e commitment to openness was a mix of 
Wilsonian idealism and a reaction to the release by the new Russian leader, V. I. Lenin, 
of secret agreements that had been negotiated by the czarist government, Britain, and 
France. Although he did not use the word “self-determination,” Wilson condemned 
old-style European imperialism and, indeed, any wars fought for territory. He insisted 
that the many diverse nationalities living within the Austria-Hungarian and Ottoman 
Turkish empires should have “an absolutely unmolested opportunity of autonomous 
development (see Map 20-4 ).” Most of all, he called for a “general association of 
nations” to preserve peace. 
Wilson stayed at the peace conference for 6 months except for one 2-week return 
trip to the United States. He did not have as much success as he expected. He was not 
well-staff ed. He found himself in painful meetings with the three European premiers 
who had diff erent goals from his and who, especially Clemenceau, obviously did not 
respect him. 
Th e treaty that emerged from the peace conference was, perhaps inevitably, a disappointment 
to everyone. Wilson got his League of Nations, which would include not 
just the allies—as Clemenceau initially wanted—but would be open to every nation of 
the world. Th e league’s covenant included Article X in which member nations agreed 
to “respect and preserve as against external aggression the political integrity and 
existing political independence of all Members of the League.” However, though the 
League now existed, Wilson had also paid a high price to get it. 
Clemenceau compromised on his initial goal of dividing Germany into several 
smaller nation-states, but he won on achieving strict limits to German military 
power, temporary occupation of the Rhineland, and a “war guilt” clause, which meant 
that Germany should pay most of the war’s cost. Most of the world’s non-European

peoples were bitterly disappointed with the treaty. Middle Eastern and African colonies 
that had belonged to the defeated Central Powers expected to be granted their 
independence by the peace conference. Instead, they became “mandates” assigned to 
various victorious powers that were supposed to grant them independence at some 
unspecifi ed future date. Japan, which had played only a modest role in the war, won 
the right to continue its control over Shandong province in China, leading a young 
Mao Zedong to call the treaty “really shameless.” In addition, protests erupted in 
India, Egypt, Korea, and China over other provisions in the treaty. 
African-American leaders also protested the failure of the Treaty of Versailles to 
respect the right of citizens of former German colonies in Africa or mention racial 
discrimination in the fi nal treaty. W.E.B. Du Bois tried to organize a Pan-African conference 
in Paris to protest the treaty’s failings, but the British government would not 
give passports to Africans from British colonies who wanted to attend, and the U.S. 
State Department refused permission to American delegates, including Madame C. 
J. Walker, the fi rst African-American woman millionaire, and journalists Ida Wells- 
Barnett and William Monroe Trotter. Du Bois made it to the meeting only by signing 
up as a cook on a freighter bound for France. 
During the peace negotiations, several new nations were created within Europe— 
Poland, Yugoslavia, Romania, and Czechoslovakia—that were supposed to recognize 
the hopes for independence by ethnic groups who had been dominated by the old tottering 
Austria-Hungary and Ottoman empires, but the mapping of those boundaries 
set off its own ethnic tensions, especially for people who suddenly became an ethnic 
minority in a new country (see Map 20-5 ). 
Wilson convinced himself that he had gotten as good a treaty as he could—which 
was perhaps true given the other actors at the peace conference—and he invested his 
greatest hopes in the idea that the League of Nations could resolve any remaining 
issues. He signed the treaty at Versailles in June 1919 and sailed for home. On July 
10, Wilson personally spoke to the U.S. Senate, asking them to ratify the treaty. He 
reminded his audience of the nation’s high ideals in going to war and the fact that “in 
the settlements of the peace we have sought no special reparation for ourselves.” Th e 
key to the whole treaty and, indeed, to future peace, Wilson continued, was that the 
League of Nations was “the only hope of mankind.” So he begged the Senate to ratify 
the treaty immediately without any amendments, asking, “Shall we or any other free 
peoples hesitate to accept this great duty? Dare we reject it and break the heart of 
the world?” Th e Senate, which had fi nal authority to approve any treaty, would take 
8 months to give Wilson his answer. 
Wilson was greeted as a hero when he arrived home in the United States, and public 
opinion seemed to be on his side, but there were problems lurking for the Versailles 
Treaty. Th e battle over the treaty has oft en been portrayed, as it was by Wilson, as one 
between his internationalism and an older isolationist view of America; however, the 
issues were more complex. Wilson had made the treaty needlessly partisan by campaigning 
vigorously, but unsuccessfully, for a Democratic victory in the 1918 elections 
and then failing to take any Republican leaders with him to Paris. He had also lost 
many of his strongest supporters who were disillusioned by the attack on civil liberties 
that he had allowed during the war and the compromises he had made at Paris. Some 
senators such as California’s Hiram Johnson and Idaho’s William Borah opposed any 
binding promise to intervene in other nation’s aff airs. Borah said that he wanted “not 
isolation but freedom to do as our own people think wise and just.” 
The greatest threat to the treaty came from Massachusetts Republican Senator 
Henry Cabot Lodge, chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who hated the 
treaty and hated Wilson even more. Lodge objected to the treaty for many reasons. 
He feared the treaty, he said, because it gave an international organization “the power 
to send American soldiers and sailors everywhere”—a power, Lodge insisted, “which 
ought never to be taken from the American people or impaired in the slightest degree.” 
Some thought Lodge was less concerned about the league than about the insult to 
20.4

20.2 
people like himself who had been excluded from the treaty-making process and his 
personal animosity to the president. Nevertheless, Lodge insisted that the issues were 
beyond party, that the United States “is the world’s best hope but if you fetter her in 
the interests and quarrels of other nations, if you tangle her in the intrigues of Europe, 
you will destroy her power for good and endanger her very existence.”

As he had done at Princeton and in New Jersey state politics when he faced opposition, 
Wilson appealed over the heads of his immediate opponents to a wider audience, 
in this case, the whole nation. In the fall of 1919, Wilson began a 10,000-mile tour of 
the country, giving 40 speeches in 21 days to enthusiastic audiences, asking them to 
tell their senators to support the treaty. Th e public response was gratifying but did not 
move votes in the Senate. Th e trip also broke the president’s already fragile health. On 
September 25 at Pueblo, Colorado, aft er a speech in which he said that with the treaty 
he had negotiated, “international law is revolutionized by putting morals into it,” and 
promising that his beloved league would “lead us, and through us the world, out into 
pastures of quietness and peace such as the world never dreamed of before,” he collapsed 
and admitted that he could not go on. Aft er he returned to the White House, 
Wilson suff ered a life-threatening infection and a massive stroke that left him partially 
paralyzed. Th e medical conditions may also have clouded his judgment and made him 
more stubborn. 
Th e Senate Foreign Relations Committee recommended approval of the treaty but 
with 14 reservations, including one insisting that the U.S. military could not be sent to 
defend Article X without specifi c congressional approval. Wilson adamantly refused 
to consider the reservations. In a fi nal vote on November 18 and 19, 1919, the Senate 
fi rst came to a tie vote for the treaty with reservations—far short of the two-thirds 
majority needed to approve a treaty. Th en on a second vote in which they considered 
the treaty without reservations, the Senate defeated the entire treaty by a vote of 55 to 
39. Th e League of Nations would be launched in Geneva, Switzerland, but without the 
participation of the United States. Wilson’s grand vision for a world at peace with the 
United States as a leader was dead. Many argued that the president’s refusal to compromise 
had been among the forces that killed it. Colonel House, who had once been 
Wilson’s closest confi dent, wrote that he had once thought that Senator Lodge was the 
worst enemy of the treaty, but before the debates and votes were over, he had decided 
that the worst enemy had actually been Wilson himself. 
With the end of World War I, Europe had a dramatically diff erent map and the 
United States had a dramatically different political situation. People who had fervently 
gone to war in 1917 were tired and cynical by 1919. Th e cost of the war in lives, 
money, and liberties led many to question the governmental and business leaders who 
had been most enthusiastic about it. By 1920, many in the nation were ready to forget 
high-sounding idealism, progressive or otherwise. It was, perhaps, time for more joy 
or, at least, the election of a more genial and less idealistic president. 
CONCLUSION 
During the Progressive Era, the United States began to look outward more than in 
the past and to extend its power and influence further across the globe. The three 
American leaders known as the “progressive presidents”—Th eodore Roosevelt, Taft , 
and Wilson—all spent much of their administrations dealing with foreign policy. In 
what some have called “the age of U.S. imperialism,” the United States took control of 
vast new territories, including Hawaii, a number of Pacifi c islands, the Canal Zone in 
Panama, as well as Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippine Islands. Alaska, which had 
previously been purchased from Russia now became an offi cial U.S. territory, Hawaii 
was annexed after an American-led revolt on the island, and the Canal Zone was 
acquired by treaty aft er complex negotiations with Panama and Colombia. Most of the 
other territories came under U.S. control as a result of the 1898 War with Spain. While 
Cuba and the Philippine Islands eventually attained independence, U.S. infl uence continued 
there for a long time.

Th e increased involvement of the United States in international aff airs in the late 
1800s and early1900s, and its expanded territorial reach, made the United States a 
major world power. Consequently, diplomatic tensions began to mount, especially 
between the United States and Latin America, where construction of the Americancontrolled 
Panama Canal and military interventions in Mexico, Nicaragua, the 
Dominican Republic, and Haiti created resentment. Although the United States had 
successfully brokered a peace agreement between Russia and Japan in 1905, further 
U.S. involvement in Asia coupled with anti-Asian legislation in California, embittered 
the Japanese. Many within the United States also opposed American involvement in 
the aff airs of the rest of the world, especially aft er the 1898 War with Spain and the 
continued U.S. occupation of the Philippine Islands 
Aft er the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914, the Central Powers 
(Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire) went to war against the 
Allies (Russia, France, and Great Britain). Americans were divided about the confl 
ict and looked to President Wilson to maintain U.S. neutrality. However, for some 
Americans, feelings changed when German U-boats sank three U.S. merchant ships 
and a British ocean liner, which killed 127 American citizens. Th e publication of a 
secret German cable to Mexico—known as the Zimmermann telegram—in which 
Germany promised the return of Texas to Mexico if Mexico would attack the United 
States, turned more of American public opinion against Germany. In 1917, when 
Germany expanded its submarine attacks, the United States entered the war. 
Support for U.S. involvement in the war was not universal, and a large and vocal 
peace movement emerged. But the Wilson administration pressed for a series of laws 
to silence dissent. In particular, the Sedition Act and the Espionage Act gave the government 
unprecedented power to restrict free speech. The Supreme Court upheld 
these laws, and many antiwar protesters were prosecuted and jailed. 
By 1918, the Allies, with support from American troops, had defeated the Central 
Powers and an armistice was signed. At the Paris peace talks, President Wilson hoped 
to secure a lasting peace and favored treaty provisions that called for a League of 
Nations. Republican opposition to the league blocked U.S. adoption of the treaty, and 
the League of Nations was launched without American involvement.

Summary 
The geographical expansion of the United States that had 
continued from the time it declared independence persisted 
throughout the Progressive Era but transformed to involve the 
acquisition of overseas territories and took place in the context 
of intensifi ed European imperialist activity. In 1867, the United 
States acquired Alaska from Russia and gave it territorial status 
in 1912. Hawaii’s strategic location led to a steady increase 
in the American presence on the islands over the course of the 
1800s. By the 1880s, American economic power in Hawaii was 
overwhelming, and in the 1890s, a coup by American planters 
led to annexation. Th e expansion of U.S. naval power went 
hand in hand with the acquisition of overseas territories.

Summary 
When Theodore Roosevelt became president in 1901, he 
inherited two major foreign policy issues: the war in the 
Philippines and the question of a Central American canal to 
link the Pacifi c and Atlantic Oceans. Th e construction of such 
a canal in Panama was one of Roosevelt’s proudest achievements. 
Roosevelt carried out an interventionist foreign policy 
in Latin America. Th e Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe 
Doctrine stated that the United States had the right to intervene 
in any nation in the Americas that could not manage its 
own aff airs. American infl uence in the Pacifi c was refl ected in 
Roosevelt’s successful negotiation of a peace treaty between 
Pacifi c rivals Japan and Russia. Tensions with Japan over anti- 
Asian immigration legislation led to the 1907 Gentleman’s 
Agreement with Japan and the expansion of the U.S. Navy. 
Although President Wilson took steps to pull back from intervention 
in Asia, the United States was heavily involved in 
Mexico and a number of other Latin American countries during 
his presidency.

THE UNITED STATES AND THE GREAT WAR 
Analyze the causes and consequences of U.S. involvement in 
World War I. 
Summary 
World War I broke out in Europe in 1914, and by the presidential 
election of 1916, there was considerable external pressure on the 
United States to take sides and enter the war. Most Americans, 
however, wanted to stay neutral. German submarine warfare led 
to increasing tensions between Germany and the United States. 
Th e Zimmerman telegram and the German decision to pursue 
unrestricted submarine warfare led Wilson to ask Congress for 
a declaration of war in 1917. Once America entered the war, the 
Wilson administration did everything in its power to suppress 
dissent and build public support for the war. Propaganda played 
an important role in Wilson’s wartime domestic policy. Congress 
took aggressive steps to abridge individual liberties during the 
war. Some Americans took advantage of wartime conditions to 
attack immigrants and workers’ organizations. Despite initial 
diffi culties, American troops turned the tide of the war in the 
Allies favor. Th e peace talks that followed the war were undermined 
by the Allies’ confl icting agendas. Th e refusal of Congress 
to ratify the peace treaty was the end of Wilson’s dream of 
American leadership in the League of Nations.

Chapter 21 A Unique, Prosperous, and Discontented Time 633 
Almost as soon as the era ended, journalists and historians began 
talking about the “Jazz Age” or simply, “the 1920s,” as a way to 
describe a distinct era in American history. Th e 11 years that was 
framed by the end of World War I in November 1918 and the stock market 
crash of October 1929 was unique in many ways. As troops returned to 
the Unites States from their service in Europe during World War I and as 
national leaders debated the Treaty of Versailles at the start of this era, many 
Americans wanted to forget about the rest of the world and its troubles. Th ey 
expected the resulting peace to usher in a time of pleasure and plenty. 
For many white middle-class Americans, the twenties were, indeed, a 
time of great prosperity and a time to enjoy the freedom of the Jazz Age. 
However for others, including many white farmers in the Midwest and 
South, southern black sharecroppers, and American Indians living on isolated 
reservations, the twenties were not prosperous at all. For many recent 
immigrants and for residents of small towns and rural areas the 1920s were 
a decade when they felt especially marginalized; when it was clear that 
sophisticated urban dwellers looked down on them and their cultural and 
religious values and their resentment took many forms. Understanding the 
diff ering experiences of those who lived through this decade is the focus of 
this chapter.

THE PRELUDE—THE RED SUMMER OF 1919 21.1 
Explain how events at the end of World War I shaped the decade that followed. 
When the guns of World War I fell silent on November 11, 1918, the world celebrated. 
While the United States had been spared much of the war’s cost, many Americans were 
not sure what to make of the postwar world. Some Americans had talked of socialism, 
even communism, since the strikes of the 1870s, but most did not follow their lead. As 
a result of World War I, communists had seized control of Russia. Some Americans 
celebrated the new Russian government, but many more feared it and wondered 
whether there might be links between America’s homegrown radicals and Russia. For 
African-Americans who had fought in the war, had risked their lives for democracy, 
and had seen diff erent cultures, the idea of returning to a United States with rigid segregation 
generated new tensions and determination. Other African-Americans had 
moved North to take war-time jobs, and they had no intention of returning to the 
segregated South. To the surprise of some, within months of the armistice, the country 
quickly became a very tense place. 
With the coming of peace, American workers wanted a part of the new postwar 
prosperity and tried to gain back the money they had lost from stagnant wages in 
an era of wartime infl ation. In January 1919, 35,000 shipyard workers went on strike 
in Seattle, Washington, and a month later, 60,000 workers in other industries joined 
them. Th e week-long Seattle General Strike, when virtually no one in the city went to 
work, stands as the largest citywide strike in U.S. history, and it frightened many. 
Th e Seattle strike was the largest but hardly the only strike in 1919. Textile workers 
in Lawrence, Massachusetts, the scene of the 1912 Bread and Roses strike (see 
Chapter 18 ) , engaged in a short and successful strike to demand a 48-hour work week 
in January 1919. In September, the police force of Boston, Massachusetts, who had 
not received a raise since 1913, went on strike. Without a police force in Boston, mobs 
looted stores and bars, the police commissioner created a temporary voluntary force, 
and Massachusetts Governor Calvin Coolidge gained national fame when he fi red all 
of the striking police offi cers, saying, “Th ere is no right to strike against the public 
safety by anybody, anywhere, any time.” 
While people debated the right of public employees to strike, steel workers went 
out on strike in September 1919 aft er the chairman of U.S. Steel, Judge Elbert Gary, 
refused to meet with union representatives. A month later, coal miners walked off the 
job, just as the nation’s demand for coal for winter heat was beginning. 
Strikes were not the only signs of political chaos in 1919. In April, bombs arrived 
in the mail of Postmaster General Albert Burleson, Attorney General A. Mitchell 
Palmer, several members of the U.S. Senate, Seattle’s antistrike Mayor Hanson, and 
federal immigration authorities and judges. Not one of them was injured, but no one 
ever discovered who sent the bombs. On May Day, an international Socialist holiday 
in honor of the Haymarket events (see Chapter 18 ) , riots erupted in several cities, 
including Cleveland, Ohio, where one socialist was killed and 40 injured in a parade. 
A few days later, a protester in Washington, DC, was shot and killed when he refused 
to stand for the national anthem. Th e crowd applauded. Th e American Legion, a new 
organization of returning soldiers, promised to uphold Americanism and attack radicals. 
In Centralia, Washington, an IWW group killed four parading Legion members, 
and the Legion lynched an IWW organizer. 
At the same time, the worldwide infl uenza pandemic that began in 1918 came 
to the United States. During 1919, half a million Americans died of the fl u, many 
more than had died in the war. Th e infl uenza did not discriminate between young 
and old or rich and poor. Although its source was microbes, not radicals, the infl uenza 
epidemic contributed to the sense that something was terribly wrong in the 
postwar world.

For many Americans, the chaos of 1919 proved that there was 
a link between U.S. labor unions, socialists, and the Bolshevik 
communist regime in Russia. Communism seemed to be spreading 
with a revolt in Hungary and uprisings in the old capitals 
of Vienna and Berlin. Maybe, some said, it was coming to the 
United States. Seattle Mayor Ole Hanson toured the country proclaiming 
that he had put down a Bolshevik uprising in his city. 
Th e Los Angeles Times told people that they needed to wake up to 
the Bolshevik menace, while former president William Howard 
Taft said that the Bolsheviks were “crusaders, pushing their propaganda 
in every country, seeking to rouse the lawless, the discontented, 
the poor, the lazy, and the shift less to a millennium 
of plunder and class hatred.” Th e Senate ordered an investigation 
of Russian Bolshevik influence in the United States. Attorney 
General Palmer presented what he said was evidence of communist 
infl uence in the country. Palmer’s proof was a witness who 
had heard one striker say, “The IWW was not as bad as it was 
supposed to be.” It was hardly overwhelming proof of an international conspiracy. 
Infl ation and stagnant wages seemed to have more to do with the strikes and protests 
than international intrigue. 
Nevertheless, people were frightened and the federal government responded. Th e 
Wilson administration not only asked Congress to extend the war-time Lever Fuel 
Act that had prohibited the obstruction of coal distribution during the war but also 
asked for a peace-time sedition law to continue some of the wartime restrictions on 
civil liberties. Using the Lever Act, Attorney General Palmer persuaded a federal judge 
to issue an injunction against the coal strike. Palmer also ordered an all-out eff ort to 
fi nd dangerous radicals and appointed a young Justice Department staff er, J. Edgar 
Hoover, later the fi rst director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, to lead it. By 
the end of November, the so-called “ Palmer Raids ” had led to many arrests, and 249 
of those arrested who had not been born in the United States were ordered deported, 
among them, the well-known radical Emma Goldman, who told federal authorities: 
Ever since I have been in this country—and I have lived here practically all my 
life—it has been dinned into my ears that under the institutions of this alleged 
Democracy one is entitled to think and feel as he pleases. What becomes of 
this sacred guarantee of freedom of thought and conscience when persons are 
being persecuted and driven out for the very motives and purposes for which 
the pioneers who built up this country laid down their lives? 
Goldman and the other deportees, along with an impressive number of guards, left New 
York on the liner Buford , bound for exile in Russia. At the same time, Congress expelled 
its one Socialist member, the strongly anticommunist representative Victor Berger from 
Milwaukee, who had opposed the war and remarked that all the American people had 
gotten out of it was fl u and infl ation. Milwaukee was not represented in Congress until 
1921. The November arrests and deportations were not the end of the hysteria. On 
January 2 and 3, 1920, Justice Department agents led by J. Edgar Hoover arrested 5,000, 
perhaps even 10,000, suspected radicals in 33 cities. Th is second round of Palmer Raids 
destroyed the tiny U.S. Communist Party and caught many others. Th e size and scope of 
the raids and the lack of evidence of a widespread conspiracy undercut public support 
for Palmer. By the spring of 1920, more Americans were starting to question the raids. 
Maybe there were not as many Bolsheviks in the country as Palmer thought. 
Fears about communists and labor unions were not the only concerns to rock the 
country in 1919. The city of Chicago had been on edge for weeks in the hot summer 
of 1919. While nearly 5,000 public employees—from garbage collectors and street 
sweepers to city hall clerks—were on strike, someone put up signs in Chicago’s black 
community that said, “We will get you July 4.” Somehow, the fear of communists 
Palmer Raids 
A series of raids by U.S. government agents in 
1919 and 1920 to find, arrest, and sometimes 
deport people considered to be dangerous 
radicals. 
The infl uenza epidemic of 1918 killed far more 
Americans than World War I—more than 500,000. 
Police and public offi cials, like these members of 
the St. Louis Red Cross Motor Corps, wore masks to 
protect themselves. Images such as this one, like 
the disease, helped spread fear around the country.

and the fear of expanded rights for African-Americans merged as it oft en did. Black 
residents, fearing an assault, armed themselves. Th en on July 27, a black boy swimming 
in Lake Michigan drift ed across the line that supposedly separated the races on 
Chicago’s lakefront beaches. A white mob beat the boy to death while a policeman 
ignored them. Blacks attacked the policeman and the white mob. 
In the days that followed, armed whites attacked Chicago’s black community, and 
blacks fought back. An injured black military veteran confronted a white crowd yelling, 
“Th is is a fi ne reception to give a man just home from the war.” Th e crowd beat 
him to death. When a group of whites drove a truck armed with a machine gun into 
a black neighborhood, blacks killed them. When the riot ended 5 days later, 23 blacks 
and 15 whites had been killed and over 500 people had been injured. Unlike previous 
race riots in other cities, which had been almost exclusively white attacks on blacks, 
the black community in Chicago had fought back. Th e black-owned Chicago Defender 
noted that “the youngest generation of black men are not content to move along the 
line of least resistance as did their sires.” 
While the Chicago race riot was by far the worst, it was not the only one that summer. 
In Charleston, South Carolina, a brawl between white sailors and local blacks left 
two blacks dead and several white sailors injured. In Longview, Texas, a white mob 
beat up a black school teacher for distributing the Chicago Defender . As in Chicago, 
blacks retaliated. Aft er the Washington Post published a series of stories about black 
crime, especially rape, a riot between white soldiers and black residents left six dead 
and hundreds injured. 
Thirty-six blacks were lynched in 1917. In 1919, 76 lynchings were recorded, 
including some of veterans recently home from World War I. In one Mississippi 
lynching, the Jackson newspapers announced plans in advance. In September, in 
Omaha, Nebraska, a mob attacked the jail where a black prisoner was being held, beat 
up the mayor who tried to stop them, and then lynched the prisoner, William Brown. 
Only U.S. Army troops under General Leonard Wood brought order to Omaha. 
As the African-American writer James Weldon Johnson looked at the racial violence 
and the fear of communists that were roiling the country, oft en being mixed, he called 
the season the “Red Summer” of 1919. Th at Red Summer was a strange and violent 
start to a decade of prosperity and discontent that followed. 
Quick Review To what extent did America’s growing involvement in the world contribute 
to domestic events in 1919? 
THE 1920s—THE EXUBERANCE OF PROSPERITY 
Analyze how Prohibition and other developments of the 1920s reshaped American culture. 
On May 11, 1921, when Prohibition had been in eff ect for a little over a year, the New 
York Times reported that an attractive 24 year-old legal stenographer from West 156th 
Street in Manhattan, Claire Fiance, had been arrested when a detective stopped her to 
ask about a suspicious looking package she was carrying and, “with a bright smile and 
a shake of her bobbed hair,” Fiance replied that she was carrying a bottle of whiskey 
(a violation of the law that prohibited the transportation of alcohol). Fiance’s arrest, 
and those of many more women like her, was a symbol of two of the most important 
shift s in American law and culture that took place in the 1920s—shift s in many 
American’s attitudes toward the consumption of alcohol and toward the appropriate 
role of women in American society. 
During the course of the 1920 presidential campaign, the Republican nominee 
Warren G. Harding coined a new word that described the nation’s mood. He said, 
“America’s present need is not heroics but healing; not nostrums but normalcy.”

Harding’s normalcy was less a return to some previously “normal” era than a plea 
to give the reforming spirit of the previous decades a rest. People were as tired 
of Roosevelt-era reforms as they were of Wilson’s internationalism. Many wanted 
to enjoy themselves, take part in the growing national prosperity, and keep the 
reformers and the government out of their lives. Th ere was nothing very normal 
about the era—especially in terms of a national law that banned alcohol, or in 
terms of the changing roles of women or the new technologies that changed the 
culture—but it seemed to summarize what many Americans wanted for themselves 
and their country. 
Prohibition—The Campaign for Moral Conformity 
Just at the time when many sought “normalcy,” the greatest reform experiment in 
the nation’s history—the prohibition of alcohol—took eff ect. Even though prohibition 
seemed like a reform more typical of the Progressive Era, the way prohibition 
was implemented was typical of the 1920s. Indeed, prohibition—and resistance to it— 
defi ned the 1920s for many. 
Americans had long been fond of alcohol. But some Americans had also long worried 
about the nation’s drinking habits. In the 1830s, the army ended the traditional whiskey 
ration for the troops. By the 1850s, school children learned to read from McGuff ey’s 
Readers that included stories about the “scene of desolation” that liquor created. Some 
religious groups concluded that drinking and Protestant Christianity were incompatible. 
Th e Women’s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) became the primary voice of 
temperance reform in Protestant America in the 1880s (see Chapter 19 ) . 
While the WCTU sought to persuade people to give up drink, a new organization, 
the Anti-Saloon League, sought to banish alcohol by law in the 1910s. The maledominated 
league had a solid fi nancial base, greatly helped by John D. Rockefeller, 
and relied on professional experts to organize campaigns, lobby legislators, and attack 
opponents. In political campaigns, the Anti-Saloon League supported “dry” (supporting 
prohibition) candidates of any party and attacked any politician it considered 
either “wet” (opposing prohibition) or insuffi ciently dry. As elected offi cials saw 
colleagues elected or defeated because of the league’s political acumen, they started to 
support prohibition whatever their personal feelings or drinking habits. 
Th e campaign to prohibit alcohol can be understood as no small part of a larger 
eff ort by native-born white Protestants, especially those living on farms and small 
towns, to retake control of a national culture that they saw increasingly under the 
sway of recent immigrants. As native-born Protestant America became more and 
more hostile to drink, many immigrants did not appreciate the campaign for moral 
conformity that they saw in the prohibition movement. 
Th e Protestant evangelist, Charles Stelzle, though a prohibition leader, was more 
understanding of the role of the neighborhood saloon than many of his compatriots. 
While many prohibitionists described saloons as dens of iniquity, Stelzle remembered 
growing up on New York’s Lower East Side where “the working men…held 
their christening parties, their weddings, their dances, their rehearsals for their singing 
societies, and all other social functions” in the neighborhood tavern. Saloons 
were oft en where ethnic groups could maintain language and tradition. In the evening, 
Germans could have their beer, Italians their wine, and Irish their whiskey, 
while enjoying the company of others like themselves. For people who gathered 
over a drink, prohibition was an attack on the freedom and acceptance they had 
come to America to fi nd. 
Anti-Saloon League leader, William Anderson, condemned immigrant resistance 
to prohibition. The Board of Temperance, Prohibition, and Public Morals of the 
Methodist Church said, “If it is true that foreign-born laborers are rebellious against 
the country because of Prohibition, it may be said that the country is not being run 
for their benefi t. If they do not like the way things are being done let them go back 
Harding’s normalcy 
A word coined by Warren G. Harding while 
he was the 1920 Republican presidential 
candidate to convey what he thought the 
country wanted—a new kind of “normal” free 
from war, international entanglements, and 
reform efforts.

to Europe.” As a result of statements like that, many recent immigrants experienced 
prohibition as an attack on their cultures and some of prohibition’s strongest advocates 
did little to discourage such an assumption. 
With the coming of World War I, the Anti-Saloon League had made support for 
prohibition a test of patriotism. Th e league had successfully inserted a clause into the 
Lever Food and Fuel Control Act banning the use of grain for hard liquor, while giving 
the president authority to regulate wine and beer production. Wilson was no fan 
of prohibition, but it was hard for him to reject a call for national sacrifi ce in support 
of the war. In December 1917, Congress—with intensive lobbying by the Anti-Saloon 
League—passed the Eighteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution prohibiting the 
manufacture, transport, and sale of liquor. Th e league worked quickly to ensure that the 
required three-quarters of the state legislatures acted and, in January 1919, Nebraska 
became the 36 state to ratify, putting the amendment over the line. In October 1919, 
Congress passed the Volstead Act, sponsored by Minnesota Representative Andrew J. 
Volstead, banning not only hard liquor (which many even among the amendment’s 
supporters thought was its purpose) but also wine and beer—anything with more than 
½ of 1 percent alcohol. Violating the law carried as much as a $1,000 fi ne. Th e U.S. 
Treasury was given authority for enforcement. Like the Eighteenth Amendment, the 
Volstead Act did not ban the possession of alcohol, only its manufacture, transportation, 
and sale—a loophole that made enforcement extremely diffi cult. Th e act also 
allowed doctors to prescribe whiskey for medical needs and drugstores to dispense it, 
and it allowed sacramental wine for religious purposes and industrial use of alcohol— 
all loopholes that would be exploited in the 1920s. 
When Prohibition took eff ect on January 16, 1920, Americans observed the day 
in widely different ways. Liquor stores sold out. People who could afford to do so 
fi lled their basements with bottles (since possession remained legal), and that night, 
saloons, hotels, and private clubs gave one last grand party. Assistant Secretary of the 
Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt drank champagne with former Harvard classmates at the 
Metropolitan Club in Washington. 
Other Americans held very diff erent celebrations. Th e best known evangelist of the 
day, Billy Sunday, told worshipers in Norfolk, Virginia, “Th e reign of tears is over.… 
Th e slums will soon be only a memory. We will turn our 
prisons into factories and our jails into storehouses and 
corncribs. Men will walk upright now, women will smile, 
and children will laugh. Hell will be forever for rent.” In 
fact, Prohibition unleashed a crime wave not only because 
illegal liquor produced great profi ts, emboldening criminals 
to new levels of creativity and violence, but also 
because so many average Americans were willing to disobey 
the law. 
A Scandalous Age—Bootleg, Ponzi, and 
Teapot Dome 
As Prohibition began in 1920, a Chicago gangster known 
as “Big Jim” Colosimo owned saloons and brothels across 
the city. Colosimo’s nephew and business manager, 
Johnny Torrio, had moved from Brooklyn to Chicago to 
work for him in 1909, and both men had become millionaires. 
Prohibition meant they had to change some of 
their ways, but they certainly planned to continue, expecting 
increased profi ts. One day, Torrio asked Colosimo to 
meet a load of whiskey that Torrio was having delivered to 
one of their cafés. Colosimo showed up on schedule and, 
as he walked through the dining room, someone emerged 
21.1 
21.2 
With the coming of Prohibition, federal agents and local police regularly raided 
establishments that served alcohol and poured it into sewers. In spite of many such 
raids, alcohol consumption was hardly slowed by the Eighteenth Amendment or the 
Volstead Act as illegal production and sales fi lled the gap. 

Chapter 21 A Unique, Prosperous, and Discontented Time 639 
21.4 
21.3 
from the cloakroom and shot him. Colosimo died instantly. While no evidence was 
ever found that Torrio or his new bodyguard from Brooklyn, Al Capone, was involved 
in the murder, Torrio—aided by Capone—quickly took control of the liquor business 
in Chicago. The Colosimo murder was only the start of the violence to come 
with Prohibition—all across the country. Organized crime had existed long before 
Prohibition, but once Prohibition took eff ect, criminals from Los Angeles to Boston, 
in powerful gangs or as individual operators, took control of the now-illegal liquor 
business in their cities, expanding their operations and criminal networks beyond anything 
seen before, oft en violently. 
Th e single most violent incident in Prohibition came near its end. By 1929, Capone 
had consolidated his control of illegal liquor in Chicago. He also controlled much of 
the police force, the elected political leadership, and the courts of Chicago and had his 
own squad of gunmen and rumrunners to bring illegal alcohol to the city, especially 
from Canada. When an upstart gangster known as “Bugs” Moran tried to take part 
of his business away, Capone hired professional killers. On February 14, 1929, fi ve 
men, two dressed as police offi cers, arrived at Moran’s headquarters. Th ey lined up 
the seven men there against a wall, shot and killed them, and calmly drove off . Th at 
bloody St. Valentine’s Day massacre provided a fi tting capstone to a bloody decade 
wherein gangsters killed each other and innocent bystanders. Many other people were 
killed in drunken brawls in the illegal saloons, or speakeasies, that proliferated or by 
drinking improperly made bootleg liquor that poisoned them. 
By 1929, after all the killing and dying, Americans were wondering whether 
Prohibition was such a good thing aft er all. Capone’s infl uence with politicians and 
police made him safe from arrest in Chicago, but aft er 1929, the newly elected Herbert 
Hoover demanded that the U.S. Treasury Department do something to uphold the 
law, even in Chicago, and Capone was eventually arrested and imprisoned for income 
tax evasion in 1931. Th e liquor trade continued unabated. 
While Prohibition-related crimes made the headlines in the 1920s, they were not the 
only criminal enterprise to fl ourish in a decade that many experienced as particularly 
lawless. In 1919, Charles Ponzi opened a new investment fi rm in Boston, announcing 
an extraordinarily high rate of return because of the skill he claimed in international 
trade. In fact, he simply paid old investors with money provided by new investors. 
Other than using the profits to live a very high life, Ponzi did not invest at all. The 
scheme made Ponzi rich and famous, but newspapers and bank investigators started 
asking questions and Ponzi’s world collapsed in August 1920. He was arrested and 
eventually deported from the United States. Investors lost all their money. Th e Ponzi 
scheme was neither the fi rst nor the last time that someone tried to get rich by catering 
to the greed of others, but it became the term used to describe that kind of fraud. 
Perhaps the largest criminal enterprise of the 1920s was conducted within the federal 
government itself. In 1909, the government set aside three large oil reserves, two 
in California at Elk Hills and Buena Vista and one in Wyoming at Teapot Dome. Th ey 
were managed by the Navy Department until the Harding administration came into 
offi ce in 1921. 
Harding, a most genial president, hated to say no to anyone, especially old friends 
whom he met for poker games and illegal drinking throughout his administration. 
When Harding’s Secretary of the Interior Albert B. Fall asked to have the oil reserves 
transferred from the Navy Department to the Department of the Interior, Harding 
agreed. Fall’s long-standing ties to the oil industry might have helped him manage the 
national assets. 
In 1922, officials in the U.S. Navy were growing nervous about the growth of 
Japan’s Navy and wanted some of the reserve oil pumped and transferred to Pearl 
Harbor. To meet the Navy’s needs, Fall secretly leased the reserves to oil companies 
owned by his friends Harry F. Sinclair and Edward Doheny for very low rates. Th e 
two pumped oil from the reserves, paying a royalty, in oil, to the Navy. Th e Navy got 
the oil it needed in Hawaii. Sinclair and Doheny made a considerable profi t. Aft er a 
21.1 
21.2 

640 Part VII War, Prosperity, and Depression, 1890–1945 
21.3 
21.4 
congressional investigation led by Montana Senators Burton K. Wheeler and Th omas 
Walsh began in 1924, it was discovered that Sinclair had made a gift of $260,000 to 
Fall while Doheny had lent the secretary $100,000 with no interest or deadline for 
payment. A great deal of additional money seems to have changed hands behind the 
scenes as Sinclair and Doheny not only stole from the government but from their own 
companies. Once Congress began to unearth the trail of oil and money, what became 
known as the Teapot Dome scandal kept spreading. Eventually, the U.S. Supreme 
Court declared both leases “illegal and fraudulent,” Fall was found guilty of accepting 
a bribe and spent a year in prison, and the Harding administration was tagged as one 
of the most corrupt in history. 
While the Teapot Dome scandal was the largest of the Harding scandals, there 
were plenty of others. Harding’s appointee as head of the Veterans’ Bureau, Charles 
R. Forbes, managed to lose some $200 million in 2 years, buying new goods at a high 
price from friends and selling goods on hand as cheap surplus. Th e arrangement made 
money for his friends but cost the government a fortune. Similar scandals involved the 
Alien Property Custodian offi ce, which was supposed to manage German assets in the 
United States, and the Prohibition Enforcement Division of the Treasury Department 
which, it was said, would ignore violations as long as the right amount of money was 
left in a fi shbowl in a New York City hotel room. With senior-level offi cials of the U.S. 
government behaving in such a manner, it was no surprise that regular citizens viewed 
obedience to the law as optional. 
The Vote for Women 
In August 1920, just months aft er the Prohibition amendment had been ratifi ed, the 
U.S. Constitution was amended again to say “Th e right of citizens of the United States 
to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account 
of sex.” Th e Nineteenth Amendment took eff ect in time for women in every part of the 
United States to vote in the presidential election of November 1920. Women’s suff rage 
and the new roles for women that evolved in the 1920s helped shape that decade as 
much or more than Prohibition or any other development. 
Th e women most associated with the two amendments—Susan B. Anthony and 
Elizabeth Cady Stanton, leaders in the long-lasting women’s suff rage movement, and 
Frances Willard of the Women’s Christian Temperance Union—all died before the 
campaigns they led achieved their goals. It was Carrie Chapman Catt’s privilege to 
preside over the victory. Catt was an active member of both the Women’s Christian 
Temperance Union and the National American Woman Suff rage Association. Th e 
organizations provided a network for her to meet other women, and those connections 
would determine the rest of her career. Catt served two terms as president of the 
NAWSA from 1900 to 1904 and again during the crucial years from 1915 to 1920. 
As World War I began in Europe, Catt was active in the Women’s Peace Party but 
left it aft er the United States entered the war. Other women such as Jane Addams and 
Jeanette Rankin, the fi rst woman in Congress, continued to oppose the war when such 
views were seen as dangerously unpatriotic. Catt, in contrast, demanded a suff rage 
amendment as a “war measure.” If the United States was going to fi ght for democracy, 
Catt argued, then expanding democracy in the United States to include women was 
essential. In 1919, the Northeastern Federation of Colored Women’s Clubs extracted 
a promise from a sometimes reluctant Catt not to agree to any compromise language 
in the constitutional amendment that could leave enforcement to the states. They 
knew all too well what Southern state legislatures would do with the votes of African- 
American women. Sadly, aft er the war, Catt did all too little to support voting rights 
for African-American women, South or North. 
In spite of diff erences about the war itself, women found ways to work together. 
Jeannette Rankin introduced the “Anthony Amendment,” the woman’s suff rage amendment, 
to the House of Representatives on January 10, 1918. Th e amendment passed 
Teapot Dome 
The name given to a major scandal of the 
Harding presidency in which U.S. Navy oil 
reserves, including those at Teapot Dome, 
Wyoming, were used to enrich the secretary 
of the interior and his friends.

the House 274 to 136. Th e Senate moved more slowly, but under Catt’s leadership, the 
NAWSA helped defeat four antisuff rage senators in November 1918, and the amendment 
was approved and sent on to the states in June 1919. A little more than a year 
later, the Tennessee legislature gave the amendment the required 36 state. On August 
26, 1920, the secretary of state announced that the amendment had been ratifi ed. 
Th at fall, more than 26 million women across the country voted in the presidential 
election. One of them, Charlotte Woodward, at 91, was the only surviving signer of the 
Seneca Falls Declaration of 1848. It had been 72 years since Elizabeth Cady Stanton 
and her allies proclaimed their right to vote. 
Very soon after women gained the vote, Carrie Chapman Catt 
helped the National American Woman Suffrage Association 
turn itself into the League of Women Voters and served as its honorary 
president until her death in 1947. Some NAWSA veterans 
debated whether women should affiliate with the Democratic 
and Republican parties or remain independent. Different women 
followed different courses of action. The newly organized league— 
initially an all-white organization—committed itself to nonpartisan 
education and helping women join parties and vote wisely. 
While the league encouraged women to engage in politics, 
other women who viewed the right to vote as merely a first step 
toward gaining other rights, pushed for a much more militant 
approach to women’s rights. Alice Paul led the National Woman’s 
Party that adopted a Declaration of Principles in 1923, which in 
part, insisted: 
In short—that woman shall no longer be in any form of subjection 
to man in law or in custom, but shall in every way be 
on an equal plane in rights, as she has always been and will 
continue to be in responsibilities and obligations. 
In their quest for these rights, the Woman’s Party began a long 
fight for an Equal Rights Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. 
Other women took a very different view of the place of women 
in society. Opposition to women’s suffrage did not disappear in 
1920, and one antisuffrage group changed the name of its journal 
from Protest to The Woman Patriot: Dedicated to the Defense 
of Womanhood, Motherhood, the Family and the State AGAINST 
Suffragism, Feminism and Socialism . It was a long title but it spelled 
out their agenda as did a 1921 article in The Woman Patriot 
that said that they “fought the grant of the ballot because they 
foresaw that it was the logical boundary line between the old 
institution-of-marriage ideal of the Family as the unit of society 
and the Feminist revolt against nature.” Battle lines of a contest 
that would continue for the next hundred years were being drawn. 
African-American women had their own concerns. During 
the 1920s, rigid segregation made voting almost impossible for 
African-American women or men. They also faced other pressing 
issues as Charlotte Hawkins Brown (1883–1961) of the National 
Colored Woman’s Club told a conference of mostly white women 
that was meeting in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1920: 
I came to Memphis crushed and humiliated.…[O]n my way 
to this conference…I had a premonition of trouble [as she 
was in a sleeping car, but found] twelve young white men 
sitting around. A young man leaned forward and said, “We 
have wired ahead to have you taken off this train. Now, we 
give you your choice, to get off this car right away and go 
into the day coach, or be taken off.”…The leader of the crowd 
said, “Let’s march,” and these young men got in front of us and 
two or three behind and we were ushered into the colored 
day coach.…Friends, what do you say about the cold-heartedness 
that we have felt?…We have begun to feel that you 
are not, after all, interested in us…We feel that so far as lynching 
is concerned that, if the white woman would take hold of 
the situation that lynching would be stopped, mob violence 
stamped out and yet the guilty would have justice meted out 
by due course of law and would be punished accordingly.…I 
want to say to you when you read in the paper where a colored 
man has insulted a white woman, just multiply that by 
one thousand and you have some idea of the number of colored 
women insulted by white men.

A Revolution in Culture—Manners, Morals, and Automobiles 
Both gaining the right to vote and Prohibition played a part in fostering a new lifestyle 
for a generation of young women who came to be known as “fl appers.” Flappers cut 
their hair short and dressed in ways that exposed more skin—on their necks, arms, 
and legs—than any previous generation. Some fl appers embraced their own sexual 
freedom, objecting to the older rules about sexuality, and many chose to drink or 
smoke. Certainly the fl appers of the 1920s were not the fi rst women to rebel against the 
sexual double standard that made women guardians of morality. Women had broken 
out of assigned spheres to fi ght for the right to vote and for social reform. But in the 
1920s, having won the right to vote, the activism of many women changed drastically. 
Flappers were determined to have equal freedom as men to do as they pleased in 
work and in their social lives. Th e emergence of the fl appers was one—but only one— 
aspect of that new activism. Preprohibition saloons and bars had been male preserves. 
No respectable woman would enter one. However, the illegal speakeasies that replaced 
the old bars in the 1920s—oft en in the same location—catered not only to men but 
also to women, and not just fl appers. As Elmer Davis, a thoughtful observer of his 
times, said of Prohibition, “Th e old days when father spent his evenings at Cassidy’s 
bar with the rest of the boys are gone, and probably gone forever; Cassidy may still be 
in business at the old stand and father may still go down there of evenings, but since 
Prohibition mother goes down with him.” 
It was not only young middle-class women—flappers—who challenged their 
status in the United States in the 1920s. Th e voices of those advocating for women had 
become stronger, and elected offi cials began to listen to the newly expanded electorate. 
In 1921, Congress passed the Sheppard-Towner Act providing federal funds for 
prenatal and infant care. In 1922, Congress passed the Cable Act, protecting the citizenship 
rights of American women who married noncitizens. By 1923, three women, 
all Republicans, were serving in the House of Representatives. Women became active 
in both political parties and ran for offi ce in all parts of the country. In New Mexico,

Many women in the 1920s asserted new freedoms not only in dress and style but also in claiming the right 
to hold a job, though too often the jobs that were available were at the bottom of the economic ladder in 
places like the typing pool.

Middle- and upper-class young women known as flappers 
were the symbols of the revolution in morals that took place 
after World War I. In previous generations, young women from 
“good families,” were expected to be the guardians of morality, but 
in the 1920s, these women became the leaders of a revolt against 
the social norms. Flappers wore make up and exposed parts of 
their bodies—necks and arms—that no decent woman of earlier 
generations would have shown. They stopped wearing corsets, 
danced closely with men, and rode in automobiles that gave them 
privacy. Some smoked, drank, and engaged in premarital sex. Far 
from hiding their revolt, they gloried in it. One self-described flapper 
appealed for understanding of her generation. 
If one judges by appearances, I suppose I am a flapper. I am 
within the age limit. I wear bobbed hair, the badge of flapperhood. 
(And, oh, what a comfort it is!) I powder my nose. I wear 
fringed skirts and bright-colored sweaters, and scarfs, and 
waists[blouses] with Peter Pan collars, and low-heeled “finale 
hopper” shoes. I adore to dance. I spend a large amount of time 
in automobiles. I attend hops, and proms, and ball-games, and 
crew races, and other affairs at men’s colleges. But none the less 
some of the most thoroughbred superflappers might blush to 
claim sistership or even remote relationship with such as I. I don’t 
use rouge, or lipstick, or pluck my eyebrows. I don’t smoke (I’ve 
tried it, and don’t like it), or drink.… 
I want to beg all you parents, and grandparents, and friends, 
and teachers, and preachers—you who constitute the “older generation”—
to overlook our shortcomings, at least for the present, 
and to appreciate our virtues. I wonder if it ever occurred to any 
of you that it required brains to become and remain a successful 
flapper? Indeed it does! It requires an enormous amount of cleverness 
and energy to keep going at the proper pace. It requires 
self-knowledge and self-analysis. We must know our capabilities 
and limitations. We must be constantly on the alert. Attainment 
of flapperhood is a big and serious undertaking! 
“Brains?” you repeat, skeptically. “Then why aren’t they used 
to better advantage?” That is exactly it!…“The war!” you cry. “It 
is the effect of the war!” And then you blame Prohibition.…But 
this is my point: Instead of helping us work out our problems 
with constructive, sympathetic thinking and acting, you have 
muddled them for us more hopelessly with destructive public 
condemnation and denunciation.… 
We are the Younger Generation. The war tore away our spiritual 
foundations and challenged our faith. We are struggling to 
regain our equilibrium. The times have made us older and more 
experienced than you were at our age.

How did Page define “flapperhood”?

of the flapper phenomenon? What was Page’s attitude

eration Amendment, ran for Congress in 1922, winning the Republican nomination but losing 
the fi nal election. Had Warren won her close race, she would have been the fi rst 
Latina among the fi rst women in Congress. 
In 1921, Margaret Sanger, who became a birth control advocate while working as 
a visiting nurse in New York City, organized a birth control conference for physicians 
and researchers in New York City and later the same year founded the American Birth 
Control League. In 1923, she opened a physician-run birth control clinic since, by law, 
only physicians, not nurses like Sanger, were allowed to dispense birth control information 
in the 1920s. She organized several international conferences on birth control 
in the 1920s. In the 1930s, she tested federal laws against the importation of foreignmade 
contraceptives and won. In 1942, the American Birth Control League became 
Planned Parenthood with Sanger as honorary chair. Planned Parenthood also supported 
the research that led to the fi rst birth control pill, approved by the U.S. Food 
and Drug Administration in 1960. 
While responses to Prohibition and women’s issues were changing the culture, 
technological changes of the 1920s also reshaped the ways Americans thought about 
culture and morality. For many Americans, urban and rural, the radio and motion 
pictures brought news of national and international events and shaped a more unifi ed 
and fast-changing national culture. Th e relatively low-cost automobile made it possible 
for more Americans to travel while giving younger Americans a degree of privacy

unheard of by previous generations—especially once enclosed sedans replaced open 
cars in the mid-1920s. Washing machines, refrigerators, vacuum cleaners, and toasters, 
reshaped traditional housework for women. In addition, new forms of fi nancing 
allowed people to buy all of these goods on installment plans, dramatically increasing 
consumer debt while making the new inventions available to more people. 
When the nation’s fi rst radio station KDKA in Pittsburgh began operating, broadcasting 
the election returns in the Harding-Cox presidential contest in November 1920, 
it ushered in a new era in news and entertainment. Within a very short period of time, 
hundreds of stations were reporting news; playing records; covering religious services, 
sports events, and political campaigns; and broadcasting live concerts (once they had 
fi gured out how to manage acoustical control). In 1927, Congress passed the Radio Act, 
which created a plan to license radio stations and regulate the wavelengths at which 
they broadcast. A decade aft er KDKA started its fi rst broadcast, half of all American 
households owned a radio. 
Although automobiles had already been introduced, they became increasingly 
common during the 1920s. Fords, Chryslers, Chevrolets, Cadillacs, Lexingtons, 
Maxwells, and Hudsons showed up in front of American homes. During that 
decade, the number of cars registered in the United States tripled from 9 million to 
26.5 million. 
Auto-related industries such as steel, paint, textile, and tire production along with 
highway construction boomed in the 1920s. Auto dealerships, gas stations, repair 
shops, roadside restaurants, and hotels grew. Congress provided funds for the federal 
Bureau of Public Roads in 1921, and metropolitan areas expanded as distances 
became easier to traverse. New York City built the Bronx River Parkway, connecting 
large parts of the city, and Los Angeles opened new highways into the heretofore 
farming country of the San Fernando Valley. 
Th e 1920s was the fi rst decade in which more Americans lived in cities and towns 
than on farms. It was also a decade in which suburbs expanded dramatically as the 
automobile and growing roadways allowed people to spread further than the train and 
streetcar tracks had during the fi rst wave of suburbanization in the 1880s. Th e pace of 
suburbanization was quickened when General Motors purchased a number of streetcar 
companies and tore up the tracks, replacing the service with General Motors buses. From 
New York to Los Angeles, the nation’s trolley system slowly withered, replaced with 
buses that could move more freely but that later added to growing traffi c congestion. 
Like the automobile, silent motion pictures had been invented well before World 
War I, and they, too, became an important part of the culture of the 
1920s. By the end of the decade, an average of 100 million Americans, 
out of a total population of 123 million, attended a movie every week. 
Movies off ered fun, escape, and entertainment. For people in small 
towns and rural areas, movies brought the larger world into their 
community. Aft er 1927, motion picture technology enabled the addition 
of sound and voice, and “talkies” became popular. Whether people 
watched the comedies of Charlie Chaplain, the cartoons of Walt 
Disney’s Mickey Mouse (created in 1928), the religious enthusiasm of 
Th e Ten Commandments and Th e King of Kings, or the sexually suggestive 
acting of Clara Bow and Rudolph Valentino, movies gave them 
new ways of looking at the world. Not insignifi cantly, movie theaters 
were air-conditioned well before most other buildings, making a summer 
evening at the movies especially appealing. 
Movies, newspapers, and magazines such as Time (started in 1923) 
created an age of new heroes. Heroes seemed to be emerging all the 
time, including “Babe” Ruth of the New York Yankees, who hit 60 
home runs in 1927 in the increasingly popular game of baseball, or 
boxers like Jack Dempsey and Gene Tunney, whose matches generated 
over a million dollars in revenue, or Gertrude Ederle, the fi rst

woman to swim the English Channel in 1926, or the decade’s most celebrated hero, 
Charles A. Lindbergh, who fl ew solo across the Atlantic in his airplane the Spirit of St. 
Louis in 1927 and was welcomed home with what was becoming a New York institution, 
a ticker-tape parade down Fift h Avenue. 
In addition, a new form of self-defined, sophisticated culture took hold. When 
Th e New Yorker appeared in 1925, its editor Harold Ross said that it was “not edited for 
the old lady in Dubuque,” but, rather, was “a refl ection in word and picture of metropolitan 
life.” Part of Th e New Yorker’s success was the guidance it gave to members—or 
aspiring members—of New York’s “smart set” on how to navigate the city’s nightlife— 
which nightclubs, speakeasies, cafes, and hotel lounges provided the best entertainment, 
the grandest design, and (though it didn’t overtly say so) the best drinks. 
Th e U.S. writers of the 1920s spoke to a generation and class disillusioned with the 
idealism of past decades as well as the business and money making that characterized 
so much of 1920s bourgeoisie culture. Many lived abroad and were dubbed the “Lost 
Generation” by Gertrude Stein, who herself lived most of her life in Paris. Among 
them were Ernest Hemingway and other writers as diff erent as T. S. Eliot and John 
Dos Passos. Sinclair Lewis published Main Street in 1920 and Babbitt in 1922, which 
both looked at the stifl ing conformity and hypocrisy of small town America. F. Scott 
Fitzgerald dropped out of Princeton, where he had spent most of his college career 
at parties, and then described that culture he knew so well in Th is Side of Paradise 
in 1920 and Th e Great Gatsby in 1925. In their literature and their assumptions, the 
social and artistic elite who lived between the end of the First World War in 1918 and 
the coming of the Great Depression in 1929 lived at a unique, prosperous, and discontented 
moment in American history and literature. 
The Harlem Renaissance and Marcus Garvey 
In 1920 as in 1820, 90 percent of African-Americans lived in the South. However, by 
1920, some blacks had begun to move away from rural poverty and segregation in the 
rural South to new opportunities in Southern cities and in the larger industrial cities 
of the North. Although the height of the Great Migration —the great movement of 
African-Americans from rural South to urban North—took place in the 1940s and 
1950s (see Chapter 24 ) , it had its beginnings during and immediately after World 
War I. Th e result was both a population shift and a cultural fl owering (see Map 21-1). 
World War I created new opportunities for African-Americans. As work 
expanded, factories in the North needed more workers. Th e Illinois Central Railroad, 
which ran straight from the heart of the cotton-growing Mississippi Delta to job-rich 
Chicago, enabled those who were moving. Th e nation’s most widely read black newspaper, 
the Chicago Defender, announced “Th e Great Northern Drive” in May 1917. 
Th e newspaper called on Southern blacks to make “Th e Flight Out of Egypt,” commissioned 
songs like “Bound for the Promised Land,” and negotiated special group 
rates with the Illinois Central. Th e paper told sharecroppers about jobs available in the 
stockyards and meat-packing houses in Chicago. 
Black music refl ected the emotions of those who moved North. Th e blues, music 
born out of gospel, ragtime, and jazz, began on back porches, small town bars and 
dance halls, and prison cells in the Mississippi Delta early in the 1900s. At fi rst, blues 
musicians sang of hard lives in the South. John Hurt sang, “Avalon [Mississippi] my 
home town, always on my mind,” and Bill Broonzy sang, “Anywhere in Mississippi is 
my native home.” But in the 1920s, the blues moved north. Th ose who had sung about 
life in Mississippi began to sing, “I’m going to Detroit, get myself a good job. Tired of 
stayin’ round here with the starvation mob.” 
Some 50,000 African-Americans moved from the South to Chicago during 
World War I and another 100,000 in the 10 years that followed. Chicago’s black 
population grew from 44,000 in 1910 to 109,000 in 1920 to 234,000 in 1930. During 
and after World War II, many more blacks would follow. In addition to Chicago,

African-Americans moved to New York; Detroit; Los Angeles; Philadelphia; Syracuse, 
New York; Oakland, California; Milwaukee; Newark; Gary, Indiana; and other cities 
that off ered jobs and a modicum of freedom. 
Cotton planters did everything possible to stop the northern migration. Th e Chicago 
Defender was branded as dangerously subversive. Plantation owners opposed anything 
more than rudimentary education for blacks so they would have few skills to take north. 
In Greenville, Mississippi, the town’s leading white citizen, LeRoy Percy, opposed the 
Klan because he feared that their brand of terror would lead to “an exodus within a year,” 
of the black people who were essential to the economy. African-Americans kept moving. 
The novelist Richard Wright described the experience of many of the early 
migrants in his novel Native Son and his autobiography Black Boy . Wright was born 
to a sharecropper family in Natchez, Mississippi. He left the rural South for Memphis 
and then in 1927 for Chicago to experience, he said, “the warmth of other suns.” It 
was not an easy move. Wright remembered, “I had fl ed a known terror, and perhaps I 
could cope with this unknown terror.” 
Th e North to which the Southern immigrants came was not always a welcoming 
place. Aft er World War I, some whites sought to reclaim the industrial jobs they had 
held before the war at the same time that wartime demand for workers ebbed. Salaries 
were much higher in the North, but so were rents. Living conditions in increasingly 
segregated and rapidly growing urban neighborhoods made for tightly packed homes. 
Race riots in Chicago and St. Louis in 1919 made it very clear just how unwelcoming 
the North could be. 
African-Americans had long lived in cities like New York, Providence, and 
Philadelphia. Free black communities emerged before the Civil War in places like 
Pittsburgh, Cleveland, and Cincinnati. In 1910, only a tiny percentage of Northern

MAP 21-1 People Moving in the 1920s. Many Americans chose to, or were forced to, move during the 
1920s. Cities and suburbs grew rapidly. Throughout the era, African-Americans moved from the South to 
Northern cities such as Chicago, Detroit, and New York. In some areas, the farmers’ depression meant giving 
up on cultivated land and starting over to farm another region or become a city worker.

blacks were professionals, mostly preachers or teachers in African-American churches 
and schools. Most Northern black men were janitors, porters, servants, or waiters 
while black women were cooks, laundresses, maids, or servants. Still, there was oft en 
confl ict between these long-time urban blacks and the newcomers from the South 
who started arriving in large numbers aft er 1917. Each found the social and economic 
position of the other threatening. 
Nevertheless, in spite of fear, pain, and segregation, something very important 
started happening in the expanding black communities of the urban North in the 
1920s, most of all in New York City’s Harlem (see Map 21-2). When the philosopher 
Alain Locke published Th e New Negro in 1925, the book he hoped would defi ne the 
Harlem Renaissance , he wrote that in that era, the African-American was, “moving 
forward under the control largely of his own objectives.” 
While the intellectual and cultural leaders of Harlem celebrated their 
Renaissance, other African-Americans, especially those on the lowest rungs of the 
economy, looked to the charismatic Marcus Garvey (1887–1940) to foster racial 
Harlem Renaissance 
A new African-American cultural awareness 
that flourished in literature, art, and music in 
the 1920s. 
21.1 
21.2 
When Howard University professor Alain Locke edited The New 
Negro, Voices of the Harlem Renaissance in 1925, a collection 
of the work of many of the artists, poets, and novelists, whose 
work was part of the movement, the word “Negro” was the preferred 
term of respect for most Americans of African descent—just as the 
term “African American” would be in future decades. Locke became 
known as the “dean” of the New Negro movement, an artistic and 
intellectual flowering of an assertive new cultural identity. The 
acknowledged capital of this new movement was New York City’s 
Harlem, and during the 1920s, the “Harlem Renaissance” defined 
elite black culture. 
From Alain Locke’s “Foreword”— 
This volume aims to document the New Negro culturally and 
socially,—to register the transformations of the inner and outer 
life of the Negro in America that have so significantly taken 
place.…Negro life is not only establishing new contacts and 
founding new centers, it is finding a new soul. There is a fresh 
spiritual and cultural focusing. We have, as the heralding sign, an 
unusual outburst of creative expression. There is a renewed racespirit 
that consciously and proudly sets itself apart. Justifiably 
then, we speak of the offerings of this book embodying these 
ripening forces as culled from the first fruits of the Negro 
Renaissance. 
From James Weldon Johnson’s essay in The New Negro , 
“Harlem: The Culture Capital”— 
In the history of New York, the significance of the name 
Harlem has changed from Dutch to Irish to Jewish to Negro. Of 
these changes, the last has come most swiftly. Throughout colored 
America, from Massachusetts to Mississippi, and across the 
continent to Los Angeles and Seattle, its name, which as late as 
fifteen years ago had scarcely been heard, now stands for the 
Negro metropolis. Harlem is indeed the great Mecca for the 
sight-seer, the pleasure-seeker, the curious, the adventurous, the 
enterprising, the ambitious and the talented of the whole Negro 
world; for the lure of it has reached down to every island of the 
Carib Sea and has penetrated even into Africa. 
In the make-up of New York, Harlem is not merely a Negro 
colony or community, it is a city within a city, the greatest Negro 
city in the world. It is not a slum or a fringe, it is located in the 
heart of Manhattan and occupies one of the most beautiful and 
healthful sections of the city. It is not a “quarter” of dilapidated 
tenements, but is made up of new-law apartments and handsome 
dwellings, with well-paved and well-lighted streets. It has 
its own churches, social and civic centers, shops, theaters and 
other places of amusement. And it contains more Negroes to the 
square mile than any other spot on earth.… 
I believe that the Negro’s advantages and opportunities are 
greater in Harlem than in any other place in the country, and that 
Harlem will become the intellectual, the cultural and the financial

pride and self-determination. Garvey established the Universal Negro Improvement 
and Conservation Association and African Communities League (UNIA) in Jamaica 
in August 1914. 
For poor blacks, especially those seeking to adjust to life in 
Northern cities, Garvey’s message rejecting integration with 
white America and focusing on self-help, self-determination, 
and African nationalism struck a powerful chord. At the beginning 
of 1918, the New York branch of the UNIA had about 
1,500 members. By 1920, Garvey claimed a membership of 
2–4 million in 30 branches across the country. 
In the early 1920s, Garvey outlined an independent path for 
blacks, “not to hate other people,” but to take responsibility for 
their own fate. “We are organized,” he said, “for the absolute 
purpose of bettering our condition, industrially, commercially, 
socially, religiously and politically.” 
Garvey was at the height of his popularity in the early 1920s. 
In 1919, the UNIA purchased a large auditorium in Harlem, and 
in August 1920, 25,000 delegates from Africa, the Caribbean, 
and the United States adopted the Negro Declaration of Rights. 
A UNIA parade in Harlem included UNIA men of the African 
Marcus Garvey, pictured with some of his followers, used lavish uniforms 
and parades to foster pride and self-confi dence in his mostly poor, African- 
American supporters.

Renaissance but also the followers of Marcus Garvey—it was the capital of black America.

Garvey created a shipping company, the Black Star Line, to carry passengers and 
freight between the United States, the islands of the Caribbean, and Africa. Th is crown 
jewel of Garvey’s economic development plan was launched in 1920 and eventually 
owned a number of ships. It was also Garvey’s downfall. Selling stock at $5 per share, 
Garvey eventually collected over $750,000, perhaps much more. But whether through 
mismanagement or corruption, or both, the line fl oundered. 
Th e Black Star Line was attacked by blacks as well as whites. In December 1920, 
W.E.B. Du Bois published an indictment of the Black Star Line. Th e fi nances of the 
Black Star Line collapsed and with it the rest of Garvey’s U.S.-based eff orts. He was 
arrested for fraud, convicted, and sentenced to 5 years in federal prison in 1923 
and began serving his term in the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary in February 1925. In 
November 1927, President Calvin Coolidge commuted Garvey’s sentence but had 
him deported to Jamaica. Garvey continued to build the UNIA in Jamaica and traveled 
through much of the world. but his infl uence, though signifi cant, declined in the 
United States. 
Quick Review How did changes in American culture refl ect the postwar desire for fun 
and leisure? When was that not the cause of change? 
THE 1920s—THE CONFLICTS ABOUT AMERICAN IDEALS 
Explain the elements of discrimination, hardship, and fundamentalism that also shaped 
American life in the 1920s. 
While the 1920s are oft en remembered as the Jazz Age—the decade of Prohibition, 
speakeasies, new automobiles, flappers, and parties—large numbers of Americans 
lived quite diff erent lives. For many, the crime and the drinking were an evil to be 
shunned. Some who refused to violate the Prohibition laws lived quiet and law- abiding 
lives; others joined organizations that were determined to enforce Prohibition, not 
always by lawful means. Growing confi dence and hope among African-Americans 
particularly threatened white Southerners, and long-simmering tensions heated 
dangerously. Despite the relative prosperity, many people on farms and in the poor 
neighborhoods of big cities still lived lives of desperate poverty. In addition, many 
native-born Americans came to distrust and fear immigrants or those who were diff erent, 
and the teaching of evolution threatened the very fabric of faith for others. Th ese 
confl icts challenged core American ideals on many levels, and reactions ranged from 
quiet frustration to vocal defi ance. 
The Rise of the Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s 
As Prohibition came into force, the Ku Klux Klan was also revived as a defender of 
Prohibition as well as an opponent of immigration, rights for African-Americans, 
and anything that undermined the dominance of white native-born Protestants in 
the nation’s life. Th e original Klan had been one of several white terrorist organizations 
that opposed Reconstruction aft er the Civil War, killing blacks and their white 
supporters and burning black schools and churches. Because of prosecution by the 
Grant administration, the Reconstruction-era Klan virtually disappeared in the 1870s. 
In 1915, a Georgian, William Joseph Simmons, inspired by nostalgia for a bygone 
era, recreated the Klan. During its fi rst few years, Simmons’s Klan was an insignifi - 
cant organization of a few hundred members. Th en in the early 1920s, a Texas dentist, 
Hiram Wesley Evans, pushed Simmons aside and turned the Klan into a hugely successful 
hate organization aimed at African-Americans, immigrants, Catholics, Jews,

and anyone who challenged the Prohibition laws. 
Under Evans’s leadership, the Klan increased from 
a few hundred to as many as 5 million members, 
including a female auxiliary that became the separate 
Women of the Ku Klux Klan (WKKK). As 
the Klan struck fear into many, it enriched a few 
leaders who controlled access to everything from 
membership dues to Klan robes and paraphernalia, 
which had to be ordered directly from the 
national headquarters. 
The Klan slogan was, “One flag, one school, 
one Bible.” It advocated for strict enforcement 
of Prohibition and—ironically, some thought— 
a cabinet-level Department of Education that 
would ensure that all American children were 
taught Klan-defined patriotism, or “100% 
Americanism.” It gave fl ags and Bibles to public 
schools while demanding the firing of Catholic 
and Jewish teachers. Th e Klan sought to require 
every student to attend public schools and, in 
Oregon, got the state to outlaw private and parochial 
schools, though the law was overturned by 
the U.S. Supreme Court before it took eff ect. 
Most people understood that the Klan also had 
another agenda: maintaining rigid racial segregation 
and, by using terror if need be, keeping African-Americans from asserting the 
right to vote or getting ahead economically. If a black man was accused of fl irting with 
a white woman, he might expect a whipping or worse from robed Klan visitors. If the 
Klan discovered an interracial couple, they attacked them. If a black did not want to 
sell land at a price off ered by a Klan member, he or she might expect a lashing until 
agreeing to sell. In 1920, Nathan Taylor, an African-American attorney in Mississippi 
who previously had been protected by white attorneys was abducted by the Klan and 
taken out to the middle of the Mississippi River and warned that, one way or another, 
he was to leave the state. Preferring to leave alive, Taylor moved to Chicago. 
The Klan, often with the Women of the Klan in the lead, launched boycotts of 
stores owned by blacks, Catholics, or Jewish people. Klan publications condemned 
the “foreign influence” of the Catholic Church and reprinted articles from Henry 
Ford’s fi ercely anti-Semitic Dearborn Independent about what they called the “money 
grasping Jews.” Th e Klan’s Constitution defi ned a goal 
to unite white male persons, native-born Gentile citizens of the United States 
of America, who owe no allegiance of any nature to any foreign government, 
nation, institution, sect, ruler, person, or people…to shield the sanctity of the 
home and the chastity of womanhood; to maintain forever white supremacy. 
Th e Klan provided entertainment in isolated small towns where there was not much 
to do. A hundred thousand people attended a Klan rally on July 4, 1923, in Kokomo, 
Indiana, which featured music and food. Almost as many attended a speech by 
Imperial Wizard Evans at Ku Klux Klan Day at the Texas State Fair in Dallas that 
fall. Th e Klan was especially strong in the Midwest and the South, but there was Klan 
activity from Maine to California. 
A number of groups, from the Catholic Knights of Columbus to the African- 
American press to the new, and specifically the anti-Klan American Unity League 
(AUL), began to challenge the Klan. Where the Klan spoke of “pure Americanism,” 
the AUL spoke of “true Americanism.” In some places, pitched battles erupted between 
The Ku Klux Klan staged massive rallies and demonstrations such as this one in Washington, DC, 
in 1925.

Klan members and their opponents, but one of the most eff ective anti-Klan tactics was 
simply to fi nd and publicize lists of members in the secret organization, asking, “Is 
Your Neighbor a Kluxer?” Opposition to the Klan, battles among its leaders, and exposure 
of internal corruption all weakened the organization, and by 1930, the Klan, which 
had once had more than 5 million members, had dropped to 50,000. Although it did 
not disappear, the Klan as a power in American life was a phenomenon of the 1920s. 
Eugenics and I.Q. Tests—The Science of Discrimination 
It was not only the Klan that sought to marginalize African-Americans, Asians, 
Catholics, and Jews in the United States in the 1920s. Th e eugenics movement used ideas 
from evolutionary biology, derived loosely (inaccurately and simplistically, many said) 
from Charles Darwin, to “prove” that some ethnic groups were more highly evolved 
than others. Th e eugenics movement was begun in England in the 1880s by Francis 
Galton, who concluded that the social elite—people like himself—were signifi cantly 
higher on the evolutionary scale than England’s working class, who in turn were more 
evolved than society’s poor and criminal element. Eugenics quickly became popular in 
the United States. Eugenics gave a scientifi c patina to eff orts to limit the immigration of 
ethnic groups from southern and eastern Europe and from Asia. Southern segregationists 
quickly latched on to eugenics as a “scientifi c” justifi cation for racial segregation. 
Margaret Sanger, the advocate for family planning and birth control, was a lifelong 
advocate of eugenics, particularly its focus on preventing inherited traits and weaknesses, 
which had been a long-used approach to agricultural breeding. Th e eugenics 
movement applied this knowledge to human concerns, including various eff orts to 
limit possibilities for those with disabilities such as deafness or limited intelligence— 
the “unfi t”—to procreate. 
Henry Goddard, a prominent American psychologist and eugenicist established 
an intelligence testing program on Ellis Island in 1913, which was used to “sort” 
the thousands of immigrants entering the country, helping to create some of the 
notions about higher or lower intelligence in various ethnic groups. Eff orts to predict 
intelligence and ability grew as a result of the development of scientifi c intelligence 
testing that began with the Army during World War I. By the 1920s, educators 
led by Stanford University’s Lewis M. Terman and Columbia University’s Edward 
L. Th orndike believed that “Whatever exists at all exists in some amount,” and that 
by measuring the amount of intelligence in a given child—through the newly popular 
IQ (or Intelligence Quotient) test—educators could assign him or her a “mental 
age” and sort the more advanced for college and the rest for menial jobs. Th ese tests 
actually measured the kind of culturally specifi c knowledge that children of nativeborn 
Protestant and northern European families learned at home, so test-takers from 
those backgrounds tended to score considerably higher than the children of southern 
Europeans, who still scored higher than eastern European Jews. Th ose of African and 
Asian descent tended to score the lowest on the IQ tests. Such “science” reinforced 
immigration restriction and racial segregation in the 1920s. 
Interest in Eugenics faded in the 1930s, especially as Adolph Hitler embraced the 
idea in Mein Kampf and used it as the basis of his anti-Semitic and anti-Slavic eff orts 
to achieve a “pure” race and eliminate any they considered “unfi t.” IQ tests remained 
popular much longer, being used well aft er World War II to sort and track students in 
school. In the 1920s, however eugenics and IQ testing enforced popular opinion in the 
United States. 
Immigration Restriction, 1924 
While groups like the Anti-Saloon League and the Klan were oft en hostile to African- 
Americans, Catholics, and Jews, they found allies in Congress who were also trying 
to end further immigration into the country. In 1924, the opponents of immigration

succeeded spectacularly when Congress cut off virtually all immigration from southern 
and eastern Europe, Africa, and Asia. In addition to anti-immigrant groups like the 
Klan, labor unions and some African-American organizations feared that a neverending 
stream of new immigrants could depress wages or take jobs. Cultural elitists, 
supported by the eugenics movement, worried that the traditional Anglo-American 
culture was being diluted. Hostility to new immigrants was not new. In the 1840s, the 
Know-Nothing Party attempted to limit Irish immigration. In 1882, Congress excluded 
Chinese immigrants. Th e largest movement to limit immigration to the United States, 
however, was led by the Immigration Restriction League (IRL), founded in 1894. 
In 1917 on the eve of U.S. entry into World War I, Congress passed a literacy 
test for new immigrants over President Wilson’s veto. Similar legislation had also 
been vetoed by presidents Cleveland and Taft , but by 1917, the anti-immigrant vote 
in Congress was strong. More immigrants than expected were, in fact, literate and 
the literacy test did not significantly reduce the number of immigrants coming to 
the United States. People like Wilbur Carr of the U.S. Consular Service warned that 
Poland’s Jewish ghettos were about to empty into the United States aft er World War I, 
fueling new fears of a new “horde” of immigrants from war-torn Europe. In response, 
Congress passed an emergency Immigration Restriction Act in 1921, for the fi rst time 
setting quotas for the numbers of immigrants who could enter the United States. 
One of the architects of even tougher anti-immigrant legislation was Congressman 
Albert Johnson of Washington State. Johnson hated radical organizations like the 
IWW and was convinced (incorrectly) that most of its members were immigrants. 
He was also strongly anti-Japanese and a member of the Asiatic Exclusion League. In 
addition, he was infl uenced by the “scientists” who argued that eugenics and IQ tests 
proved that Asians as well as southern and eastern Europeans were inferior people to 
“Nordic” stock. Johnson became chair of the House Committee on Immigration in 
1919 and set out to write new legislation. 
In setting the quota for the number of immigrants, Johnson decided not to refer to 
the 1910 census, which had been the basis of the 1921 restriction but which was taken 
well after large numbers of Russian, Italian, and other southern European immigrants 
had arrived in the United States. Instead, he referred to the 1890 census, taken 
just before that wave of immigration, to set new quotas. Using the 1890 census, and 
limiting the percentage of immigrants allowed into the country to 2 percent of that 
number, Johnson cut the total number of immigrants allowed into the United States 
per year from 357,803 to 161,184. Th e proposed law also tilted the ethnic makeup of 
the new arrivals against ethnic groups that had arrived in large numbers between 1890 
and 1910. Italy was cut from 42,057 immigrants per year to 3,912, Poland from 21,076 
to 5,156, and Russia from 5,638 to 474. Yugoslavia, created out of the pre-World 
War I Austria-Hungarian Empire, was cut from 6,426 to 851 immigrants. Russian 
Jews, Italians, and Slavic immigrants were reduced to a trickle. In contrast, German 
immigration was only cut from 67,607 to 51,299 and Britain’s from 77,342 to 62,458. 
Northern Europeans did not generally fi ll their quotas, but the rest of the world was 
reduced drastically. Under the Johnson formula, Japan should have been allowed 
240 immigrants, but Johnson insisted that the bill ban all Japanese immigration to the 
United States. 
Urban representatives led by New York’s Fiorello LaGuardia protested. Th e American 
Jewish Committee criticized the bill. It did no good. Th e new 1924 immigration restriction 
passed the House and Senate by wide margins, and President Coolidge, who had 
already told Congress that “America must be kept American,” signed the bill. Although 
some modifi cations were made, from 1924 until the 1965, immigration to the United 
States from most of Europe and all of Asia and Africa was severely limited. 
The 1924 legislation, however, did not impact all immigration. It did not stop 
Irish immigration since large numbers of Irish immigrants had come to the United 
States before 1890, which under Johnson’s formula kept the quota high. It also had no

impact on immigration from North and South America, since the bill allowed unlimited 
immigration from Canada and Mexico. Approximately 500,000 Mexican workers 
came to the United States during the 1920s. Th ey fi lled agricultural jobs in the West 
previously held by Japanese immigrants as well as railroad jobs and industrial jobs 
in Chicago; Gary, Indiana; and Detroit, Michigan. Th e Mexican community in Los 
Angeles, a city founded by Mexican immigrants, grew rapidly. 
The 1924 immigration restrictions created deep tensions between the United 
States and some other countries, most of all China and Japan. The government of 
Japan, which had sought to work with several American administrations to construct 
“Gentlemen’s Agreements” limiting immigration, was incensed at the disrespect 
in the ban of even the 200 immigrants per year that the quota would have allowed. 
Coming on the heels of previous insults like the 1906 segregation of Japanese students 
in the San Francisco public schools, the 1924 legislation contributed to deep-seated 
anti-American feelings in Japan. Other governments, including those of Italy and 
Rumania, objected to the legislation. Nevertheless, the United States was in an isolationist 
mood aft er the end of World War I, and the protests did not stop the closing 
of America’s previously very open gates. Members of Congress responded to foreign 
protests by saying that, “the nation’s immigration laws should be made for Americans 
and not to please foreigners,” and “No foreign government has the right to tell the 
United States who we shall or shall not admit.” 
Just as the United States was closing its doors, the trial of two recent immigrants 
polarized the nation. Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti were arrested on May 5, 
1920, for robbery and the murder of a paymaster and guard of a shoe factory in South 
Braintree, Massachusetts. Th ey were tried in the midst of the antiradical, anti-immigrant 
hysteria sweeping the country and were convicted in July 1921. Aft er a long 
series of appeals, reviews, and massive public protests, during which Sacco 
and Vanzetti maintained their innocence, their conviction was upheld and 
they were executed at Charlestown Prison on August 23, 1927. 
Th e case of Sacco and Vanzetti took on enormous symbolic importance 
during the 1920s. Opponents of immigration and of political radicalism 
generally assumed that they were guilty simply because they were 
immigrants and self-confessed anarchists. For others, winning freedom 
for Sacco and Vanzetti could be, depending on one’s view, a blow struck 
for the cause of anarchism, or for the rights of immigrants, or simply the 
right to a fair trial. For observers during the 1920s, the Sacco and Vanzetti 
case symbolized how much a nation made up of immigrants had turned 
against those immigrants who arrived most recently. 
The Farmers’ Depression 
For many farmers, World War I had brought prosperity as the prices 
for wheat, cotton, and other agricultural products went up signifi cantly. 
With new money to be found in every bushel or bale, farmers extended 
production between 1914 and 1918. Farmers enjoyed amenities as never 
before. In the early 1920s, one farm wife wrote about the “running water 
in the house! What a constant cause of thankfulness! What a joy to use all 
I need and want!” No more would she have a long hot walk to the spring 
for a pail of water to sooth a thirsty child or to wash a dipper because “the 
water from that same spring is in our pressure-tank.…” 
Farmers kept expanding the areas they cultivated. The rich lands 
of the Delta in northwest Mississippi were still more than 60 percent 
wilderness in 1914. Bears were seen in cornfields and wolves attacked 
livestock. But in the war years, the world needed more cotton than ever, 
and planters cleared land as fast as they could. By the war’s end, much of 
the Mississippi Delta was in cotton production and land sold for up to 
Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti’s trial symbolized the fears 
of immigrants to some and the hopes for justice for others. Vanzetti 
defi ned the way he wanted to be remembered. In May 1927, he 
told a journalist who visited him in the Dedham jail, “If it had not 
been for these things, I might have lived out my life talking at street 
corners to scorning men.…Never in our full life could we hope to 
do such work for tolerance, for justice, for man’s understanding of 
man as now we do by accident.”

$1,000 an acre. Agricultural centers like Greenville, Mississippi, “Th e Queen City of 
the Delta,” had 15,000 people with paved streets and factories in 1920. Some 20 railroad 
trains stopped every day, and agents in Greenville sold cotton directly to buyers 
in New York, Chicago, and New Orleans as well as the European cotton markets at 
Liverpool, England. Prosperity, it seemed, had fi nally arrived in the Delta. 
Similarly, in the arid cattle country of southern Kansas and the panhandle region of 
Oklahoma, land that had never been plowed was being turned into farmland as fast as 
developers and settlers could break the sod with a plow and set up windmills to bring 
water from deep below. Driven by the insatiable wartime need for wheat and encouraged 
by the Union Pacifi c Railroad, which brought settlers, plows, and windmills, settlers fi led 
53,000 new homestead claims in the Great Plains in 1914 alone. Th e former grassland was 
now producing wheat, and many families who started out living in a mud-walled dugout 
imagined that there was a fortune in store if only they could turn over enough sod. “Plant 
more wheat to win the war,” the government said, and farmers in the Midwest and the 
Plains, happy to mix patriotism and profi t, did just as the nation asked. 
Then, the war ended. Europe began planting its own wheat again. Disbanded 
armies did not need uniforms. By 1920 and 1921, most of the world was caught up in 
an economic downturn that drastically reduced the demand for everything, especially 
wheat and cotton. Th e general economy started to recover in 1922 and 1923, but the 
farm economy did not. Even with its new prosperity, the United States could not consume 
all of the wheat and cotton and meat produced on the nation’s farms. For many 
farmers, the Great Depression of the 1930s began in 1920 or 1921. 
Not all farmers were impacted in the same way. Due to the new popularity of ice cream 
and increased use of milk in American diets, dairy farmers prospered. Vegetable farmers 
sold celery, spinach, and carrots to city people who had discovered vitamins. But those 
producing the staple crops—wheat, cotton, and corn—did not prosper. In 1921, cotton, 
which had brought a dollar a pound only a year before, sold for only 20 cents a pound—if a 
buyer could be found. Wheat prices also fell drastically However, the price of the fertilizer 
farmers needed for their crops and the coal they needed to heat their homes kept rising. 
Desperate to maintain their incomes, farmers did what seemed logical: they 
worked harder. If the price for a bushel or bale dropped, the only thing to do was to 
produce more. What was logical on an individual basis was disastrous on a national 
one. Th e more the farmers produced, the more the oversupply led prices to fall. Th ere 
seemed to be no way to break the pattern. 
Senators and representatives from the farm states were desperate for help, and 
Congress passed the McNary-Haugen bills under which the federal government would 
set a minimum price for farm products and buy them when the price fell to that level. 
Th e government would then store the goods until prices rose. But PresidentCoolidge 
vetoed the bills as unsound government intervention in free markets. Midwestern 
progressives complained, but they did not have the votes to override the veto. 
In 1927, nature seemed to turn against rural America. It rained a lot that spring. 
Farmers generally like spring rains, but in 1927, there was too much rain. One of the 
most intense storms in history came on Good Friday, April 15, 1927. In New Orleans 
alone, 14.96 inches of rain fell in less than a day. Th e Mississippi River fl ooded from 
Illinois to Louisiana (see Map 21-3). Engineers had been building levies to contain the 
Mississippi and its tributaries for decades, and by the 1920s, levies were everywhere. 
Behind the levies, farmers had cleared and planted thousands of acres of land. Cities 
and towns had grown up. However, prosperity, even survival, depended on the levies 
holding. Th at April in 1927, they did not hold. Th e fl ood of 1927 covered an area 
150 miles long and 50 miles wide along the Mississippi River with water, some of it 
20 feet deep, and made 200,000 people homeless, perhaps even three times that number. 
Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover directed the rescue eff orts, and the Red 
Cross provided aid across a stricken country. Many criticized rehabilitation eff orts 
that spent an average of $20 per fl ood victim as too little too late.

In the aft ermath of the fl ood, many never recovered. Crops planted later that year were 
beset by disease and an early frost. Pellagra, the result of poor diet, affl icted 50,000 people 
in the Mississippi Delta. Farmers gave up on the land. Sharecroppers simply moved away. 
More blacks moved north, and more farmers—black, white, and Latino—moved to town. 
Soon the generally prosperous nation quickly forgot the fl ood and the devastation. 
The Scopes Trial 
Th e general prosperity of the 1920s drove many social changes. High schools began 
to spring up in small towns and scattered rural communities, offering educational 
opportunities that had been limited to big cities before 1920. In 1890, a total of 200,000 
American youth were enrolled in high school. Thirty years later, that number was 
2 million and growing—a 10-fold increase. 
With the growth of high schools, some Americans started to worry about just what 
was being taught in them, in particular, biology. Th e new high school biology classes were 
greatly infl uenced by the 1859 publication of Charles Darwin’s Origin of Species, which 
described all changes in plant and animal life, including the emergence of human beings, 
as natural selection—a process by which random biological changes in individuals within 
a species that are benefi cial for survival become passed on to subsequent generations. 
Th e book was at once controversial, particularly in terms of its theological implications. 
Most scientists embraced Darwin’s work and saw no confl ict between the new 
biology and traditional religious teachings. Even those scientists who questioned it 
acknowledged the important contribution. Harvard’s Asa Gray wrote a popular high 
school botany textbook in the late 1800s that presented evolution as showing that all 
life was “part of one system,” showing “One Mind.” Aft er 1900, however, a new generation 
of scientists stopped talking about One Mind. George William Hunter’s textbook, 
A Civic Biology , simply said “Species have been modifi ed during a long course of 
descent, chiefl y through natural selection.”

Popular religion was also evolving. Before 1900, most Protestants, liberal or 
conservative, assumed that the Bible was a fairly accurate historical record, but that 
assumption was challenged by German-inspired “higher criticism” of the Bible that 
sought to understand the Bible in terms of the social context in which it was written. 
In reaction, a new movement known as Fundamentalism began within American 
Protestantism in the early 1900s. Fundamentalist ministers called for a literal reading 
of the Bible and rejected any other interpretation of the “unchanged word of God.” 
Fundamentalism represented a new militant form of Protestantism and a much more 
pessimistic view of modern society. Protestants have traditionally been optimistic 
about the future. Fundamentalists were pessimistic about a sinful world. Th ey saw the 
United States of the 1920s, with its open fl outing of Prohibition laws, the questionable 
moral standards of the fl appers, the growth of Catholic and Jewish immigrant communities, 
and the teaching of evolution in the schools, as full of evil. 
For growing numbers of American parents and political leaders worrying about 
the high school curriculum—the changes in scientific thinking and the increasing 
infl uence of fundamentalism came into a dramatic collision in the trial of a local high 
school biology teacher, John Th omas Scopes, in the small town of Dayton, Tennessee, 
in 1925. Scopes, as required by Tennessee regulations, used Hunter’s A Civic Biology 
textbook in his classes. In following the mandated state curriculum, he also violated a 
Tennessee law against the teaching of evolution. 
Between 1922 and 1925, a number of states under pressure from fundamentalists, 
including Tennessee, outlawed the teaching of evolution. Th e American Civil Liberties 
Union (ACLU), however, saw these new laws as an assault on free speech and placed 
ads in newspapers, including the Chattanooga Times, asking for volunteers to test the 
law and promising legal counsel. Business leaders in Dayton, Tennessee, thought the 
town could use some publicity and asked Scopes if he would volunteer for the test 
case. He agreed, and one of the most famous trials in U.S. history resulted. 
Although they had long been on the same side of political battles, the nation’s leading attorney, Clarence 
Darrow, and three-time presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan, represented opposite sides in the 
trial of Tennessee biology teacher John T. Scopes that captured national attention.

Dayton and the nation got quite a show. Clarence Darrow, the best known lawyer 
in the country, volunteered to join the ACLU team. Former presidential candidate 
William Jennings Bryan volunteered for the prosecution. Every major newspaper in 
the country covered the trial. Most people thought Darrow got the better of Bryan in 
the arguments, but on the facts, Scopes was clearly guilty. Scopes admitted he had violated 
the law, and he was found guilty and fi ned $100, though the Tennessee Supreme 
Court threw the case out on a technicality to avoid appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, 
which the ACLU wanted. 
Cautious textbook publishers changed their books. In future editions, A Civic 
Biology stopped calling Darwin “the grand old man of biology” and instead simply 
said that he was a “leading biologist.” Evolution, which in the earlier editions had been 
a “wonderful discovery” now became merely Darwin’s “interpretation of the way in 
which all life changes.” Only in the late 1950s would a full discussion of evolution 
return to high school textbooks. 
Quick Review To what extent were the racism, anti-immigration efforts, and fundamentalism 
of the 1920s the result of changes throughout the United States? 
HARDING, COOLIDGE, AND HOOVER—NATIONAL POLITICS AND 
POLICIES IN THE 1920s 
Analyze the political and policy developments of the decade. 
Th ree Republican presidents led the United States during the 1920s. Th e election of 
Warren Harding in November of 1920 was almost a foregone conclusion given the 
general disenchantment with Woodrow Wilson’s policies, the war, and the League 
of Nations. A politician who promised to return the nation to “normalcy” was just 
what people wanted. Harding and his running mate Massachusetts Governor Calvin 
Coolidge defeated the Democratic nominee, Ohio Governor James Cox, and his running 
mate, the young Franklin Roosevelt by 16 million to 9 million popular votes. In 
what was his last race, the Socialist Party candidate, Eugene V. Debs polled close to a 
million votes while still in prison for violating the World War I sedition laws. Late in 
1921, Harding commuted his sentence, and Debs was freed. 
Although Harding was remembered mostly for the scandals of his administration, 
he also made some very strong appointments. Th ree months aft er coming to 
offi ce, he appointed former President William Howard Taft to the job Taft had always 
wanted, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, where Taft served until 1930. Charles 
Evans Hughes, the 1916 Republican presidential candidate, became secretary of state. 
Knowing that there was no chance of U.S. participation in the League of Nations 
but wanting to foster peace in the postwar world, Hughes called the Washington 
Conference in 1921 to try to end the competition among the United States, Britain, 
and Japan to build up their navies. To the surprise of many, the result of the conference, 
the Five Powers Treaty of February 1922, slowed the worldwide navy build up 
and established limits on battleships, battle cruisers, and aircraft carriers in a ratio of 5 
each for the United States and Britain, 3 each for Japan, and 1.75 each for France and 
Italy. No limits were set for other types of ships. In 1922 Hughes also ended the longstanding 
U.S. occupation of the Dominican Republic. 
Harding also appointed Andrew Mellon, one of the wealthiest people in the United 
States, to serve as secretary of the treasury. Mellon, who served through the Harding, 
Coolidge, and Hoover administrations, ensured that there was a close and comfortable 
relationship between government and business. He cut government spending, cut 
taxes, and retired half of the World War I debt while in offi ce. He was oft en hailed as 
“the greatest secretary of the treasury ever” until the coming of the Great Depression 
raised serious questions about his policies. Herbert Hoover, perhaps the most liberal

member of the cabinet, served as secretary of commerce 
for Harding and Coolidge, encouraging cooperation 
between businesses to stabilize industrial production and 
the economy. 
Harding died suddenly in August 1923, probably 
the result of a heart attack. His wife’s refusal to allow an 
autopsy led to rumors that he was poisoned or committed 
suicide, though there was never any evidence for 
either. His death came just as the Tea Pot Dome scandal 
was about to come to light. He was reported to have 
asked Herbert Hoover “what a President should do whose 
friends had betrayed him?” Harding was deeply mourned, 
but as the scandals of the Harding administration surfaced, 
his reputation was tarnished before the year was out. 
Fortunately for the Republican Party, Harding’s vice 
president, the stern and distant Calvin Coolidge, had no connection 
to the scandals and quickly took steps to investigate 
them. News of Harding’s death reached the vice president 
while he was vacationing with his father in a rustic Vermont 
farmhouse. Since the house had no electricity, Colonel John 
Coolidge administered the presidential oath of offi ce to his 
son by the light of a kerosene lamp—a reassuring image that 
perfectly fi t the tone of austerity and adherence to old-time 
values that the new president wanted to set. More important 
to Coolidge’s success, the economic downturn of 1921 had 
eased, and by 1923, many Americans were experiencing an 
economic boom, known as the “Coolidge prosperity.” To 
no one’s surprise, Coolidge, a man of so few words he came 
to be known as “silent Cal,” was nominated for a full term by the Republican Party in the 
summer of 1924. 
Th e Democratic Party was deeply divided between a southern and western wing that 
was primarily white, Protestant, rural, and supportive of Prohibition and a northern 
wing that, though also very white, included many Catholics and Jews, and was highly 
urban as well as strongly anti-Prohibition. Th e Klan was a force at the summer nominating 
convention where their opposition to a Catholic candidate who wanted to repeal 
Prohibition made itself felt. Th e two leading contenders for the nomination included 
former Treasury Secretary William G. McAdoo, a “dry” who favored Prohibition and 
was supported by the southern and western wing of the party, and New York Governor 
Al Smith, a Catholic and a “wet” staunch opponent of Prohibition. Th ey battled for 103 
ballots before the delegates turned to the West Virginia lawyer and former congressman 
John Davis in an exhausted compromise. Others, disgusted with both parties, rebuilt the 
old Progressive Party of 1912 and nominated Wisconsin’s popular progressive Senator 
Robert La Follette for president. 
Coolidge’s victory in the 1924 elections was as decisive as Harding’s had been in 
1920. He won 54 percent of the total with only 28.8 percent for the Democrats and 
16.6 percent for the La Follette Progressives. Except for Wisconsin, which went for 
La Follette, Coolidge carried every state outside of the then solidly Democratic South. 
The Coolidge administration took some important steps in foreign policy. Just 
before he took offi ce as Coolidge’s vice president, Charles G. Dawes negotiated the 
so-called Dawes Plan to help ameliorate the German fi nancial crisis brought on by the 
huge reparations payments to Britain and France. In 1925, Coolidge appointed Frank 
Kellogg as secretary of state. Two years later in 1927, French foreign minister Aristide 
Briand proposed a joint U.S.-French alliance, but Kellogg turned the conversation to 
a multilateral treaty. Th e Kellogg-Briand Pact outlawing war was signed in Paris in 
The Kellogg-Briand Pact 
1928 international treaty that denounced 
aggression and war but lacked provisions for 
enforcement.

As this cartoon shows, the Tea Pot Dome Oil scandal that came to light in 1923 soon 
after President Harding's death threatened to steamroll over many leaders of the 
Republican Party. However, the fact that the new Republican president, Calvin Coolidge, 
had nothing to do with it allowed party leaders to distance themselves from the 
scandal and in the end have an easy road to the White House in the November 1924 
elections.

August 1928, and eventually, 62 nations were signatories to the much acclaimed agreement. 
Unfortunately, unlike the plan for the League of Nations, there was no enforcement 
mechanism to the Kellogg-Briand Pact. While passive at home, U.S. government 
under Coolidge also enthusiastically encouraged engagement with Latin America, 
maintaining military force in some countries and doubling investment in others. 
Aft er coming to offi ce in 1929, Hoover tried to improve relations with Latin America, 
removing American troops from Nicaragua and Haiti. In addition, while not officially 
recognizing the government of the new Soviet Union, the Coolidge and Hoover 
administrations encouraged business investment and the Soviet government welcomed 
it, especially the mass-production of automobiles that they called “Fordism.” 
Th e 1928 presidential election that brought Hoover to offi ce was very diff erent 
and much closer than the previous two. Th e tone of the contest was angrier. When 
Calvin Coolidge announced that he would not seek another term as president, the 
Republicans nominated Hoover. The Democrats, tired of their losses in 1920 and 
1924, decided that Al Smith’s charisma and enthusiastic support in the North would 
make him a winner. Aft er all, many asked, didn’t the South vote for the Democratic 
nominee no matter who he was? 
On many issues, Hoover and Smith were not far apart. Hoover was more liberal 
than Coolidge and privately worried that the Coolidge prosperity was a balloon that 
would surely pop. He said that he looked forward to the day when “poverty will be 
banished from this nation,” though he saw business success, not government intervention, 
as the key to accomplishing that goal. Coolidge once called him “that damn 
Bolshevik.” Smith was also a friend to big business. Once nominated, Smith chose 
John J. Raskob of General Motors to run his campaign and included several leading 
industrialists in his inner circle. 
Nevertheless, there were two huge diff erences between the candidates. Hoover 
was a “dry” who favored continuing Prohibition, and Smith was a “wet” committed to 
ending it. Hoover called Prohibition “a great social and economic experiment, noble 
in motive and far-reaching in purpose.” Smith told the convention that nominated 
him that “there should be fundamental changes in the present provisions for national 
prohibition.” With many people becoming disillusioned with Prohibition, on that 
issue alone Smith might have had the edge. 
However, another issue infl uenced the race. Hoover, a Quaker, was a Protestant. 
Smith was a Catholic. Many Catholic voters in places like Boston, New York, Chicago, 
and San Francisco rallied to Smith with an enthusiasm they had never shown for any 
previous presidential candidate. Meanwhile, in much of the nation’s Protestant heartland, 
Smith’s Catholicism was the heated issue of the campaign. Th e candidate himself 
thought he had addressed the issue, but as he campaigned in the Midwest and 
South, Smith could see burning crosses on the hillsides and his rallies were met by 
Klan members. At one rally in Oklahoma, Smith eyed the crowd and commented to 
a reporter, “I don’t know those people out there. I don’t speak their language.” On 
election day in November 1928, Hoover won, carrying states in the South that had 
not voted Republican since the end of Reconstruction and even Smith’s home state 
of New York. Smith won 40 percent of the vote and carried Massachusetts, Rhode 
Island, and parts of the South, but Hoover’s 58 percent of the vote and 444 electoral 
votes guaranteed that he could enter the White House with a solid mandate. Th e stock 
market responded to Hoover’s election by reaching greater heights than ever before. 
Th e new president kept his reservations about the stock market bubble to himself. Th e 
nation seemed confi dent in their new president, the economy, and the way society 
had been moving for the last 10 years. It would be Hoover’s bad luck that none of this 
confi dence would last through his fi rst year in offi ce.

CONCLUSION 
Th e 1920s marked a period of signifi cant social and political change in the United 
States. Th is period, known by many as the “Jazz Age,” began at the conclusion of World 
War I and ended with the stock market crash in 1929. For many Americans, especially 
those in the middle and upper classes, the 1920s were a time of prosperity. For other 
Americans, however, the 1920s were harsh. 
In the so-called Red Summer of 1919, many working people in the United States 
were deeply dissatisfied with the terms and conditions of their employment. They 
wanted their salaries adjusted to refl ect the infl ation generated by the war, and they 
also wanted a share of the postwar boom. Strikes were common as were violent confrontations 
between wage earners and business elites, whose fear of bolshevism intensified 
their opposition to organized labor. Racial tensions also boiled over in that 
summer, and race riots took place in cities around the country. 
In January 1920 when the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution outlawed 
the “manufacture, sale, or transportation” of any alcoholic beverage, the resulting era 
of Prohibition set off a wave of opposition. Bootleggers found ways to manufacture 
and sell alcohol in defi ance of the Eighteenth Amendment, and average citizens found 
ways to drink alcohol as they fl outed the law. Th e widespread prosperity and contempt 
for Prohibition also set the stage for other law breaking during the decade, including 
investment fraud and corruption in the federal government. 
In this turbulent period, women gained the right to vote when the Nineteenth 
Amendment was passed. With their newly gained power, some younger women 
declared themselves to be “fl appers,” fl outing social conventions, and many women 
began reforms around prenatal care and birth control as well as other issues relevant 
to them. Th e presidential election of November 1920 was the fi rst election in which 
women in every state in the United States took part. 
Technological innovations combined with favorable government policies toward 
business resulted in high corporate profits throughout the decade. The economic 
growth of 1920s sustained a new mass culture focused on materialism and consumerism 
and was characterized by the automobile, the radio, and the movies. Social 
and cultural change affected all Americans. African-Americans began the Great 
Migration, a movement of large numbers of Southern blacks from the rural South 
to the urban North, which continued from the 1920s to the 1960s. Newly arriving 
African-Americans in the North launched the Harlem Renaissance, a fl owering of 
black culture in music, novels, and poetry, centered in New York City’s Harlem while 
others became followers of Marcus Garvey. 
For many other Americans, the 1920s were a diffi cult time. While sweeping changes of 
the 1920s were welcomed by many, a large portion of American society objected to what 
they saw as the erosion of traditional American values, leading to a resurgent Ku Klux 
Klan among other things. Th e black community faced brutal racism in both the North 
and the South. Race riots swept across the country from Chicago, Illinois, to Charleston, 
South Carolina, wherever blacks began to push for greater equality and economic opportunity. 
A nation built on immigration turned against immigrants, and 1924 legislation 
drastically reduced immigration to the United States. White farmers in the Midwest and 
South also suff ered greatly as crop prices plummeted. Th e government largely ignored 
the plight of these Americans. Other Americans turned to a new kind of religious fundamentalism 
challenging such things as the teaching of evolution in the public schools. 
Th ree Republican presidents—Warren G. Harding, Calvin Coolidge, and Herbert 
C. Hoover—presided over the nation during the 1920s and while they diff ered among 
themselves, all three supported the growth of a business-oriented culture and saw 
business success as the key to prosperity for all.

sexual double standard. Th e automobile industry was both the 
engine of the American economy and a major cultural force in its 
own right. Radio and movies fueled a mass culture on a national 
scale. Artists and writers responded to this mass culture and the 
balance between prosperity and discontent. African-Americans 
began to contribute in a large manner to the culture. Th e 1920s 
saw the emergence of the blues and jazz in a cultural explosion 
called the Harlem Renaissance. Marcus Garvey’s African nationalism 
struck a chord with many African-Americans, particularly 
those near the bottom of the economic ladder.

behind the new Klan inspired the eugenics movement. Congress 
responded to anti-immigrant sentiment by establishing immigration 
quotas in 1924 that limited immigration from most 
of Europe and all of Africa and Asia. While much of America 
prospered during the 1920s, rural America did not, and the

weak, and the law was widely flouted. Moreover, Prohibition 
proved a boon to organized crime. Under Prohibition, the sense

within the Harding administration. For many, the culture

In late October 1929, the value of shares sold on the New York Stock 
Exchange, known as Wall Street, collapsed. Prices kept dropping for 
the next 3 years in a dizzying decline in which paper wealth simply 
evaporated. For most Americans, the stock market crash seemed irrelevant 
at fi rst. For industrial workers, who rarely owned stock, the value of 
shares in the enterprises where they worked was not important, but the 
subsequent drop in industrial jobs as production of automobiles, radios, 
appliances, and clothing dried up was all too real. For many farmers in 
the Deep South and those trying to get by farming small mountainous 
farms in Appalachia, the Depression had come much earlier, beginning 
with the drop in agricultural prices in 1920 (see Chapter 21 ) . For other 
farmers, especially those who had plowed the plains and created the 
wheat farms of Oklahoma and Kansas in the 1910s and 1920s, the full 
impact of the Depression came later. Wheat farmers struggled with the 
fact that a glut in the world supply of wheat kept prices low all through 
the 1920s, but it was with the terrible dust storms of the 1930s, storms in 
which the child of one farmer remembered, “you couldn’t see your hand 
in front a’ your face,” that the full impact of the Depression was felt in 
this region. Th is chapter traces the story of the many causes that led to

THE COMING OF THE GREAT DEPRESSION 
Explain the coming of the Great Depression and the initial response to it. 
Th e Great Depression was a worldwide crisis. Th e crash of the American stock market 
was but one of many causes of the economic catastrophe. People lost their jobs in 
Japan. In Chile, mineral exports, the mainstay of its economy, collapsed, leading to 
joblessness, and the government, which lost tax income, could do little. In Germany, 
already suff ering from a precarious economy, industries went bankrupt and millions 
of workers were laid off . Industrial production collapsed in Great Britain leading to 
hunger marches by the unemployed. Jobs disappeared in Canada. And in the United 
States, the combined impact of the stock market crash (which had an impact worldwide), 
the continuing farm depression, and the rapid decline in industrial production 
led to national paralysis. 
The Great Crash: October 1929 and the Coming of the Great 
Depression 
Speculative booms and busts had occurred regularly in economies (and continue even 
in modern times) as people allowed prices to rise far beyond value and then the inevitable 
crash in prices came. In the 1600s, Dutch investors were caught up in speculation 
in tulip bulbs, and in the 1720s, English investors lost fortunes in what came to be 
known as the Great South Sea Bubble, In the mid-1920s, many Americans began to 
buy Florida real estate that later became worthless. 
Th e Great Crash of 1929 was a prime example of this phenomenon. U.S. economy 
did well in the 1920s and it would have been strange if the value of stocks had not gone 
up. Stocks, aft er all, are merely partial ownership in a company, so a share of stock 
purchased on the New York Stock Exchange for a company (U.S. Steel or General 
Electric, for example) is a share in the ownership of that company. If the company 
makes a suffi cient profi t, dividends are paid to shareholders. If a company increases in 
value, the value of each share increases. However, if a company does poorly, or a lot of 
people start to worry that a company will do poorly, shares will probably decrease in 
value. Th e stock market is—in theory—a place where people who want to sell a share 
of stock meet people who want to buy one and agree on a price; the price of the most 
recent sale of stock is then listed as the current value of the stock. 
During the 1920s, stock prices generally rose, with some modest downturns 
between 1924 and 1928. Toward the end of 1928, especially aft er Herbert Hoover’s 
election victory in November, the stock market started going up much faster. Many 
people—including president-elect Hoover, as he later wrote in his memoirs—were 
worried that the prices were showing all the hallmarks of a speculative boom. Still, 
people continued to buy stocks. Th e Radio Corporation of America, known on the 
stock market simply as “Radio,” was a relatively new company that had never paid a 
dividend. Radio sold for $85 a share at the beginning of the year, and the price rose 
to $420 a share by the end of the year. (Stock prices are reported simply as whole 
numbers, so Radio sold for 85 and 420.) Other companies followed the same course: 
DuPont began the year at 310, ending at 525; department store giant Montgomery 
Ward began at 117, ended at 440. At the height of the market in September 1929, still 
without distributing a single dividend, Radio was selling for 505. 
As people saw the chance to make money, they also borrowed money to buy stocks, 
a process called buying on margin. If a person could invest $85 in Radio and a year later 
have a stock worth $420, why not borrow enough to buy ten shares for $850 and fairly 
quickly reap $4,200? And brokers were more than happy to lend the money. Buyers were 
expected to use their own money for 25 percent to 50 percent of the value of a stock but 
could easily borrow the rest. Early in the 1920s, perhaps a billion dollars of loans were provided 
to cover stock purchases; by the end of 1928, those loans reached six billion dollars.

In the spring of 1929, the outgoing President Calvin Coolidge reported that the 
economy was “absolutely sound,” and stocks were “cheap at current prices.” Th e more 
cautious Hoover, who understood economics better than his predecessor, believed 
instead that the “growing tide of speculation” was not merely a problem but was, indeed, 
a “crime,” yet worried that his saying so might cause a devastating loss in confi dence. By 
September 1929, a respected economist Roger Babson warned, “Sooner or later a crash 
is coming and it may be terrifi c.” Factories will shut down, he predicted, and “men will 
be thrown out of work.” Th e speech precipitated a drop in stock prices, but the so-called 
“Babson Break” lasted only for 1 day. Most economists thought Babson was wrong. 
Stock prices kept going up through the spring of 1929, and then in the summer they 
skyrocketed. From the beginning of June to the end of August, Westinghouse stock 
went from 151 to 286, General Electric from 268 to 391, and U.S. Steel from 165 to 258. 
At the sight of those kinds of profi ts, most investors simply forgot about the warnings. 
Th e market reached its high point on the day aft er Labor Day in 1929. Th ere was 
a small downturn in September and by October, everyone started to worry. Th en in 
late October, speculation turned to panic as stock prices just kept falling. Tuesday, 
October 29, known as Black Tuesday, was the worst single day in the history of the 
stock exchange. Crowds formed all up and down Wall Street. Contrary to contemporary 
rumors and latter-day myths, there were no suicidal leaps from windows, though 
a few speculators did die by their own hand on that and the following days. Most quietly 
watched their life savings disappear as prices continued to fall. 
In the months and years that followed, stock prices continued to fall. On 
November 11, the New York Times Industrial Average closed at 224; a drop by half from 
452 from September. Th e worst possible news was followed by even worse news as prices 
kept falling through 1930, 1931, and 1932. By July 1932, the New York Times reported the 
Dow Jones Industrial Average as 58—a little more than a tenth of what it had been only 
3 years earlier. Value, it seemed, had simply disappeared from American businesses. 
Th e loans that had enabled many to buy stock “on margins” made things worse. 
When the value of a stock fell to the actual percentage the buyer had invested, 50 percent 
or 25 percent, the stock broker who had arranged the loan would notify the owner that 
he or she had to produce more money to 
pay off the loan or else the stock would 
be taken over by the broker and sold to 
recoup the loan. Since many investors had 
put all their savings into the stock market, 
they had no funds to cover such “calls” 
and were wiped out. Even if the market 
later rallied, they had no investment left . In 
addition, the brokers often were not able 
to sell the stock in time to protect the loan 
either, so brokers lost money, too. 
The stock market crash was far from 
the only problem with the nation’s 
economy in 1929. At the same time, basic 
underpinnings of the American economy, 
including banking, manufacturing, 
farming, and international trade, were also 
surprisingly fragile. When the economy 
came apart, it came apart thoroughly. A 
sizable number of Americans, perhaps as 
many as half—farmers, farm workers, and 
sharecroppers; American Indians living 
on reservations; factory workers; widows; 
and the elderly—had been living on the 
edge of poverty throughout the boom. 
This picture refl ects some of the chaos on New York’s Wall Street on October 29, 1929, as stock values 
crashed and people saw their life’s savings disappear.

22.1 
In 1930, before even the initial impact of the Depression, 60 percent of American 
families had a total income of less than $2,000 per year, which was then considered the 
poverty line. 
Between 1929 and 1932, farms across the country were foreclosed on—and more 
would have been had not armed groups of farmers banded together to prevent the 
sales. Factories, which had been overproducing, now closed and workers lost their 
jobs. One out of four people in the United States was out of work by 1932. Many were 
living in shanties, and others rode the rails as stowaways or waited in bread lines. 
In the winter of 1932–33, the nation’s banking system started to collapse as banks 
that had also invested in stocks or off ered mortgage loans on property that was now 
worthless failed, and state governors announced “bank holidays” in their states to stop 
further failures. 
The Hoover Years, 1929–1933 
Herbert Hoover had been president for only 7 months when the stock market crashed. 
Given his background, Hoover seemed the ideal president for a moment of crisis. 
As a trained engineer who had helped feed a starving Europe during World War I 
and served as Secretary of Commerce, he understood economics; moreover, he was 
far more fl exible than Coolidge. As the economy worsened, Hoover called on people 
to engage in voluntary collective action—asking business leaders to keep wages and 
prices up, asking bankers to pool resources to help weaker banks, encouraging farmers 
to form cooperatives and keep excess crops off the market. He cut taxes and supported 
federal public works such as construction of dams, bridges, and hospitals to stimulate 
the economy. Aft er 1932, he reluctantly agreed with a Democratic Congress to create 
the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to provide funds to keep banks and railroads 
from bankruptcy as well as the Emergency Relief and Construction Act to lend money 
to states for relief and public projects. 
As the economy worsened, however, Hoover’s call for voluntary solutions 
seemed weak. Farmers were reluctant to cut back on their crops if their neighbors 
would simply fi ll the gap. Bankers were too worried about staying solvent to bail out 
other banks. Th e Reconstruction Finance Corporation never invested enough to save 
all the banks that needed saving. Hoover tried but failed to negotiate a reduction in 
the reparations that were wrecking the German economy and thus undermining 
U.S. trade with Europe. Th en in 1930, Congress passed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff , a 
disastrous move that was designed to protect American industries by raising the cost 
of imported goods, but resulted in a trade war as other nations also raised their tariff s 
in return, leading to a huge decrease in international trade with devastating results. 
Despite the dire circumstances, Hoover, though no orthodox conservative, could not 
bring himself to support further government intervention and debt. 
Perhaps it was simply Hoover’s bad luck to preside over the beginning of the 
Depression. People would have blamed him no matter what he did. When he tried 
to restore confi dence by announcing that, “Th e fundamental business of the country, 
that is production and distribution of commodities, is on a sound and prosperous 
basis,” things just kept getting worse and people lost confi dence in him. When homeless 
families built communities of shacks, they called them Hoovervilles . When outof-
work veterans marched to Washington as the “ Bonus Army ” to demand a pension, 
he ordered the army to disperse them and people called him heartless. When he had 
lost his bid for reelection and tried to get the incoming administration to cooperate 
on a plan for the banking crisis in early 1933, Roosevelt ignored him. Hoover’s was an 
unhappy presidency in an unhappy time. 
Quick Review How did the fragile economy of the 1920s combined with the stock market 
crash create a dire situation for the American people? What actions did the Hoover 
administration take to address the situation? What other actions could Hoover have taken? 
Hoovervilles 
Shantytowns, sarcastically named after 
President Hoover, in which unemployed and 
homeless people lived in makeshift shacks, 
tents, and boxes. Hoovervilles cropped up in 
many cities in 1930 and 1931. 
Bonus Army 
A protest movement of World War I veterans

THE NEW DEAL 
Explain the goals and results of the New Deal and the responses to change on the part of 
diverse Americans. 
In the desperate situation that the United States faced in 1932, probably the most desperate 
economic moment in American history, most thought that whoever won the 
1932 Democratic nomination would win the election. Aft er all, the crisis had occurred 
under the leadership of previous Republican presidents. Among the Democrats, Al 
Smith entered the race again along with Speaker of the House of Representatives 
John Nance Garner, former cabinet member Newton Baker, and New York Governor 
Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Roosevelt won the nomination on the fourth ballot and, 
breaking precedent, flew to the Democratic National Convention in Chicago to 
accept the nomination in person on July 2, 1932, where he promised a “ New Deal 
for the American people,” coining the phrase by which his administration would be 
known. He selected Garner to be his running mate and, promising “a New Deal for the 
American people” while off ering very few specifi cs, defeated Hoover by a landslide in 
the November election, carrying 57 percent of the vote and 472 electoral votes. 
In the long months between the election in November and the inauguration on 
March 4, 1933, the U.S. economy kept getting worse. (Th e date of the inauguration 
was later changed by the 20th Amendment to the Constitution so that every president 
aft er Roosevelt was inaugurated on January 20 aft er a much shorter wait.) Th e number 
of unemployed workers and evicted farmers kept growing. In addition, the banking 
system, the heart of the nation’s economic structure, faltered, and more banks closed. 
Banks that had given loans to buy stocks now held worthless paper since the loans 
could never be repaid. Banks that had given loans to farmers now owned worthless 
farm land or were blocked from foreclosure by angry farmers. As more banks failed, 
people began to take their money out of the remaining banks. A “run on a bank,” 
as a large number of withdrawals all at once was known, could put any bank out of 
business because no bank simply kept deposits in its vaults but, rather, invested the 
money. In 1930, 1,352 banks closed; in 1931, 2,294 more went out of business; and in 
1932, another 1,453 failed. In November 1932, Nevada’s governor proclaimed a “bank 
holiday,” temporarily closing all banking before more banks got into trouble. Iowa 
followed in January, then Michigan, Maryland, Oklahoma, Indiana, Ohio, Arkansas, 
and Arizona in February. Sixteen more states closed banks at the beginning of March, 
and fi nally, on March 4, Illinois and New York—home to the nation’s largest banks 
in Chicago and New York City—declared a bank holiday. On that day at noon, with 
most banks closed and most economic activity in the country at a standstill, Franklin 
Roosevelt was inaugurated to replace Herbert Hoover as president. 
The Brain Trust and the First 100 Days 
At his inauguration, the new president told the nation that it must not “shrink from 
honestly facing conditions in our country today.” And he was blunt about what those 
conditions were, saying: 
Only a foolish optimist can deny the dark realities of the moment. Yet our 
distress comes from no failure of substance.…Plenty is at our doorstep, but 
a generous use of it languishes in the very sight of the supply. Primarily this 
is because the rulers of the exchange of mankind’s goods have failed, through 
their own stubbornness and their own incompetence, have admitted their 
failure, and abdicated. 
But in that same address, he also insisted on his “fi rm belief that the only thing we 
have to fear is fear itself—nameless, unreasoning, unjustifi ed terror which paralyzes 
needed eff orts to convert retreat into advance.” Given the nation’s situation, many 
could think of quite a few things to fear, but Roosevelt made it clear that he was ready 
to act to address the crisis, and that alone gave people optimism—for a time.

Roosevelt had a magnetic, optimistic personality. He used radio, still a new 
medium, to connect with the American people through frequent fi reside chats and 
press conferences. Roosevelt had been paralyzed by polio in the early 1920s, but few 
Americans knew that he could not walk without help, and the media kept his secret. 
Radio carried the president’s voice and kept his disability out of sight. Another wellkept 
secret was the deep strain in Roosevelt’s marriage. While Franklin and Eleanor 
Roosevelt’s personal life was oft en tense, as a public couple, they were extraordinary. 
Th e new fi rst lady was oft en the eyes and ears of the administration, visiting desperate 
farmers and industrial workers, traveling down mine shaft s to coal mines, speaking 
to audiences around the country, and bringing the nation’s problems back to the 
White House. People responded to her on a personal level. Th ousands of “Dear Mrs. 
Roosevelt” letters poured in to the White House. Together, Eleanor and Franklin 
Roosevelt projected hope to a nation that wanted desperately to believe. 
The new president knew that although people were willing to give the new 
administration a chance, their patience was short. Banks could close for a few days, but 
if people could not get their money, pay their bills, keep their mortgages up to date, a 
worse crisis would follow. Roosevelt’s economic team moved to reopen the banks. Th ey 
ignored a proposal by Wisconsin Senator Robert La Follette, Jr., to nationalize the banks. 
Using a plan that had been draft ed by offi cials in the outgoing Hoover administration, 
they convinced Congress to pass an Emergency Banking Act on March 9 that allowed 
those banks deemed safe to open, and permanently liquidated the weakest. Aft er 1 week 
in offi ce, President Roosevelt gave his fi rst fi reside chat, assuring people that “it is safer to 
keep your money in a reopened bank than it is to keep it under the mattress.” Th e run on 
the banks stopped, and the newly federally approved banks remained solvent. 
Th ree months later, Congress passed the Glass-Steagall Act that created the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation to guarantee bank deposits. Given the role banks had played 
in the stock market speculation of 1928 and 1929, the Glass-Steagall Act also separated commercial 
banks and investment banks; the former could take deposits and make loans, with 
government guarantees, and the latter could invest in the stock market, at their own risk. 
Early in 1932, while he was still a candidate for the presidency, Roosevelt (or 
FDR, as many called him) had created what he called his “Brain Trust.” Th e original 
fireside chats 
Speeches broadcast nationally over the 
radio in which President Franklin Roosevelt 
explained complex issues and programs in

Fireside Chat, 1936 
In her first year as the nation’s First Lady, Eleanor Roosevelt received 
more than 300,000 letters, a large percentage of which were from 
young people asking for her help. Mrs. Roosevelt had become a 
personal symbol of caring for the Roosevelt administration, and 
people—particularly poor people and especially children—turned 
to her. From the thousands letters such as the one shown here, the 
needs of those who lived through the Great Depression, especially 
the young, also take on a human face. 
Dear Mrs. Roosevelt, 
I am a thirteen year old girl and live on a farm with my mother 
and Step-Father we are very poor people I have lived here for five 
years and have wished each year for a radio but as the years go 
by our circumstances get worse and worse. I am wondering if I 
would be asking to much of you to help me obtain one. As we 
live in the country we wold have to have a Battery Radio. We live 
five miles from town, and we are poor and we have no money for 
boughten amusements. There is not a radio around in the country 
and I get terribly lonesome in summer. . . 
Sincerely yours, M.N.C.

core group—Raymond Moley, a political scientist; Rexford Tugwell, an economist; 
and Adolf Berle, a legal financial expert, were all professors at Columbia 
University. Others joined or departed from the group. Although they argued with 
each other, the members of the Brain Trust all agreed that a lack of purchasing 
power was a key cause of the Depression and that a way had to be found to raise 
farm income and industrial wages so more Americans could buy more of what 
the nation could produce, thus putting more Americans back to work. Th ey, like 
FDR, disliked what they called “the dole” and preferred jobs, any jobs, to welfare. 
When Roosevelt came to offi ce in 1933, the Brain Trust guided much of his 
policy. Some members of the offi cial cabinet represented the older, more cautious 
Democratic Party establishment. However, others in the cabinet were closer to 
the Brain Trust, especially farm editor and inventor Henry Wallace, who became 
secretary of agriculture; Chicago reformer Harold Ickes, who became secretary of 
the interior; and Roosevelt’s long-time New York State ally, Frances Perkins, who 
became secretary of labor and the fi rst woman in a president’s cabinet. 
In what became known as the fi rst 100 days , Congress passed a steady stream 
of new legislation. On March 13, Congress passed the Economy Act, giving the 
president broad powers to cut government spending. It also amended the Volstead 
Act to legalize beer while the country waited for the repeal of Prohibition. While 
the Economy Act cut federal costs—and did nothing to stimulate the economy— 
the amended Volstead Act not only allowed people to drink beer legally but also 
brought millions of dollars of new tax money into the treasury. Before the end of 
March, Congress established the Civilian Conservation Corps, probably the most 
popular New Deal agency, through which hundreds of thousands of unemployed 
young men worked in rural camps planting forests, pruning trees, building parks, 
and shoring up the nation’s wild lands, thus giving many of the unemployed 
jobs and income to spur the economy. In April 1933, FDR, took the country off 
of the gold standard, replacing currency backed by gold with currency backed 
by the government’s promise to pay. Th e change put badly needed money into 
circulation since the supply of dollars was no longer limited by the amount of 
gold in government or bank vaults. 
In May, the president signed the Federal Emergency Relief Act that provided direct 
government grants to those without incomes (Hoover had provided loans). He also 
signed the Agricultural Adjustment Act that sought to shore up farm prices with a 
not-always popular program to plow under 10.5 million acres of cotton and slaughter 
6 million piglets. Many, including agriculture secretary Henry Wallace, were heartsick 
at the destruction of food in a nation with many hungry people, but one-third of the 
nation’s workers were in agriculture, and the Brain Trust believed that raising farm 
prices by ending the surplus of agricultural products, and therefore raising the income 
and spending power of farmers, was the highest national priority. Before the end of 
May, Congress also created the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to build dams on 
the Tennessee River that would control fl oods, bring electricity to rural areas that were 
without it, and provide jobs (see Map 22-1 ). 
In June, in addition to the Glass-Steagall Act that regulated the banks, Congress 
passed the National Employment System Act, the Home Owners Refi nance Act, the 
Farm Credit Act, the Railroad Coordination Act, and perhaps most significant, the 
National Industrial Recovery Act. Th e last act established two of the best known New 
Deal agencies, the Public Works Administration (PWA)—committed to large-scale 
construction projects across the country—and the National Recovery Administration 
(NRA) with a mandate to create a voluntary national network of businesses to maintain 
wages and prices. In 100 days, the United States had a quite diff erent federal government 
than it had ever seen before. Th e National Recovery Administration set minimum wages 
and prices, outlawed child labor, and guaranteed labor the right to organize. Th e NRA 
was later declared unconstitutional, but from 1933 to 1935, the NRA, with its “We Do 
Our Part” signs in store windows across the nation, was a prime symbol of the New Deal.

The Indian New Deal 
The New Deal was a time of extraordinary change for many Americans, including 
American Indians. Like other New Deal initiatives, the changes began during the 
Hoover years. In 1928, Lewis Meriam led a study of federal Indian policy. Meriam’s 
team conducted the fi rst large-scale examination of the impact of the 1887 Dawes Act 
(see Chapter 16 ) . 
In his report, Th e Problem of Indian Administration , Miriam was blunt, writing, 
“Th e work of the government directed toward the education and advancement of the 
Indian…is largely ineff ective,” and, “Th e provisions for the care of the Indian children 
in boarding schools are grossly inadequate.” Meriam called for moving the education 
of Indian children to their home and tribal context, which was done. 
Roosevelt appointed social worker John Collier as commissioner of Indian Aff airs. 
Collier came to offi ce determined to right some of the wrongs that had been done, and 
by June 1934 he had convinced Congress to pass the Wheeler-Howard Act, also known 
as the Indian Reorganization Act. Two years later, in 1936, Congress extended the same 
rights to native Alaskans. Th is law was the beginning of what came to be known as the 
Indian New Deal . Under the Indian Reorganization Act, the government recognized 
the legal rights of Indian tribes (not done since 1887), including tribal right to hold 
reservation lands. Tribes adopted constitutions and formed governments. Tribes, not 
the federal government, were given the right to decide on tribal membership—not 
an easy issue aft er generations of relationships between whites and Indians. For most 
tribes, the Indian New Deal was a fresh start.

African-Americans, the Depression, and FDR’s “Black Cabinet” 
Th e Great Depression hit African-Americans especially hard. Many who had moved to 
northern cities were still on the bottom of the economic ladder and were oft en among 
the first to lose their jobs. As business failed and the need for goods and services 
declined, African-American jobs declined precipitously. In 1934, a government survey

and other fi elds where there were large numbers of black workers. Agricultural 
Adjustment Administration payments often helped landlords but were not 
passed on, as they should have been, to help tenant farmers or sharecroppers. In 
the Civilian Conservation Corps, which provided jobs for unemployed young 
people—originally only males—some 200,000 African-American boys and young 
men did get jobs and work experience, but the CCC maintained rigidly segregated 
camps. Th e federal Home Owners Loan Corporation was designed to give loans 
to blacks and whites, but local offi cials of the Federal Housing Authority oft en 
decided that blacks were a poor risk and so denied loans to them. 
Nevertheless, many African-Americans made significant gains during the 
Great Depression. Recognizing that AAA payments were being withheld, African- 
American sharecroppers organized the Southern Tenant Farmers Union to demand 
payments. African-American voters began to shift political allegiance from the 
“Party of Lincoln” to the Democratic Party because they were attracted to Roosevelt’s 
New Deal Policies and especially Eleanor Roosevelt’s active support as she visited 
black communities, advocated for black civil rights, and courted African-American 
voters. Blacks began to win elections to state legislatures. In 1928, Chicago’s Oscar 
DePriest was elected to the U.S. Congress, the fi rst black since Reconstruction. Black 
votes helped defeat candidates who opposed antilynching bills. 
Early in his administration, Roosevelt created what came to be known as the 
Black Cabinet , a shift ing and informal group. Roosevelt’s (white) Secretary of the 
Interior Harold L. Ickes, former president of the Chicago branch of the NAACP, and 
Eleanor Roosevelt enlarged the size and power of the Black Cabinet. Robert L. Vann, 
editor of the Pittsburgh Courier, served as special assistant to the attorney general, and 
William H. Hastie, dean of the Law School at Howard University, served as a legal 
advisor to the Department of the Interior. Robert C. Weaver (who in the 1960s would be 
the fi rst African-American in the cabinet) advised the Department of the Interior. 
Perhaps the most prominent member of the Black Cabinet was Mary McLeod 
Bethune. Bethune was head of a school for girls in Daytona, Florida, that would 
become Bethune-Cookman College. During the 1920s, Bethune became president of 
the National Association of Colored Women, which advocated for a federal antilynching 
bill and for support for black women in attending training programs and college. 
Frustrated by what she saw as the conservatism of the NACW, she launched the more 
aggressive National Council of Negro Women in 1935. 
At Eleanor Roosevelt’s urging, Bethune was appointed as the director of the Negro 
Division of the National Youth Administration (NYA), where she channeled some of 
the NYA’s considerable resources toward creating jobs for African-American youth. 
Bethune used her position and her friendship with Eleanor Roosevelt to organize a 
Federal Council of Negro Aff airs to ensure that blacks in and out of the administration 
spoke with one voice. When Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson called a conference 
on women and the war eff ort in 1941, and failed to invite black women, she wrote to 
him, “We are not humiliated. We are incensed.” Bethune was not going to be ignored. 
The Dust Bowl and the “Okie” Experience 
Unlike the many farmers who faced troubles in the 1920s, wheat farmers of Oklahoma, 
Kansas, and the Texas panhandle oft en prospered during that decade because even 
when the price of wheat fell they could always plow more land and plant more wheat. 
As the Depression worsened, however, the Plains farmers faced a unique crisis. 
Eventually the ever-expanding production of wheat caught up with the farmers. 
Th e wheat harvest in the fall of 1931 was the most bountiful in history. Farmers 
had been planting more land, and it was exceedingly fertile. Th e result was that far 
more wheat was produced that fall than could possibly be consumed. Europe, like 
the United States, was in a depression. Wheat exports and wheat consumption were 
down. Th e price paid for wheat fell so low in 1931 that farmers lost money on every

bushel produced. Many vowed not to plant in 1932, and probably a third of the Great 
Plains farmers faced foreclosures for debt or back taxes. 
Th en a diff erent disaster struck. Starting late in 1932 and continuing in 1933, 1934, 
and 1935, farms across the Great Plains simply blew away. Year after year, the dust 
storms continued, but the worst storm came on Sunday April 14, 1935, known to those 
who lived through it as Black Sunday . Th e day began sunny and windless. Th en in the 
aft ernoon, the wind picked up, and what looked like a purple or black wall started blowing 
in from the northwest. Jeanne Clark remembered that she had been outside playing 
when she heard a panicked call from her mother to come inside. Before she could get to 
the house, the storm hit. “It was like I was caught in a whirlpool,” Clark said. “All of a 
sudden it got completely dark. I couldn’t see a thing.” Th at one storm took 300,000 tons 
of soil from the Great Plains and deposited it hundreds of miles away—twice as much 
soil as had been dug out of the Panama Canal. Clark remembered the terrible coughing 
that followed. A doctor said she had “dust pneumonia” and might not survive. Clark did 
survive, but others, mostly children and old people, died from the dust storms. Before 
the end of the 1930s, more than 250,000 people—two-thirds of the Plains population— 
simply left what had become known as the “Dust Bowl” (see Map 22-2 ).

MAP 22-2 The Dust Bowl. Overplanting and plowing of soil with too little water led to massive dust 
storms that destroyed agricultural communities in states from Texas to North Dakota. Route 66, the highway 
from Chicago to Los Angeles, became the route by which many Dust Bowl refugees sought a new life in 
California agriculture. 

674 Part VII War, Prosperity, and Depression, 1890–1945 
Aft er 1910, scores of white settlers with high hopes had come to the Great Plains 
and built farms in the “last frontier,” encouraged by the government. Since the land 
was so dry, the government also doubled the homestead allotment to 320 acres. Th e 
weather could be terribly hot in the summer and cold in the winter, but the soil was 
rich. A few old-timers and ranchers said, “God didn’t create this land around here to 
be plowed up.” But farmers plowed and grew crops on land that had previously grown 
only grass. 
In the 1930s, however, there was a prolonged drought, and the wells had to be dug 
deeper to fi nd any water. Th e soil started to dry up, and then the wind, which always 
blows hard on the Plains, started to carry the soil away. Cattle suff ocated from the 
dust. People rubbed Vaseline in their nostrils to protect them, and the Red Cross gave 
out respirator masks at school. People stuff ed wet towels and sheets into cracks in 
doors or windows only to see their houses fi lled with dust anyway. 
As the New Deal administration began to grapple with the Dust Bowl crisis, agricultural 
agents arrived in the region in 1934 off ering up to $16 a head for the remaining 
cattle, which were either shot on the spot or shipped to a slaughterhouse in 
Amarillo, Texas. Th e government off ered payments averaging $498 for a promise not 
to raise a wheat crop the following year. Th e CCC tried to build demonstration projects 
to reclaim the land. Th e reclamation projects did not work. Th e $498 paid off old 
debts, but hope of a more bountiful year in 1935 or 1936 seemed remote. Farmers and 
townspeople began departing in 1934, and before long, a region and a way of life—one 
that was less than a generation old—simply disappeared. 
Most people who left the Dust Bowl moved to California. In the midst of a 
national Depression, they became migrant farm workers—hired hands on the farms 
of California’s Central Valley where they were given the derogatory name of “Okies , ” 
(on the assumption that they were all from Oklahoma). For many Californians the 
“Okies” were desperately poor intruders in a state whose own economy was suff ering 
terribly. Photographers working for the Farm Security Administration (FSA) 
took their pictures; Carey McWilliams, a young California lawyer, wrote Factories in 
the Fields describing their plight; and one of the country’s best known writers, John 
Steinbeck, immortalized their experience in Th e Grapes of Wrath . Tom Joad, the hero 
of Steinbeck’s novel defi ned what it meant to be an Okie: “Okie use’ to mean you was 
from Oklahoma. Now it…means you’re scum. Don’t’ mean nothing itself, it’s the way 
they say it.” Nevertheless, for the characters in Steinbeck’s novel and for thousands of 
real-life migrants, it was also a term of pride and of grim determination. 
Longtime residents of California’s Central Valley feared the Okies. Mexican and 
Filipino agricultural workers worried, for good reason, that white Dust Bowl refugees 
would take their jobs. A preference for those who were native-born led many 
California farmers to give jobs to whites during the Great Depression, leaving longtime 
employees without work. Moreover, the California growers, a powerful political 
bloc, were happy to have more competition for jobs in the fields and to pit ethnic 
groups against one another other. 
Mexican American and Filipino farm workers, too often ignored by traditional 
unions, had created their own unions. In 1933, before the arrival of most Dust Bowl 
refugees, 47,500 agricultural workers were involved in 37 diff erent strikes in California’s 
rich Central Valley. Some 5,000 mostly Mexican American workers were involved in the 
partially successful El Monte berry strike in June 1933 and a larger cotton strike that fall. 
By the late 1930s, up to 10 workers were applying for every job in the California 
fi elds, and a fi eld hand who made a dollar per day was doing well. Probably half of 
those working in the California fi elds were “Okies” while the other half were longtime 
workers who were Mexicans or Filipinos. Th e unions were divided by ideological differences 
as well as by splits between the newly arrived refugees and those who had 
been in the fi elds for a generation. 
Despite the eff orts of California farm workers to build unions in the fi eld, few 
strikes were very successful. California agribusiness was strong and got stronger

22.2 

Chapter 22 Living in Hard Times 675 
during the 1930s. Th e Associated Farmers of California that was founded in 1934 
had resources and power far beyond anything available to the California farm 
workers. 
Whatever one’s race, working in the fi eld was terribly hard work. Dust Bowl refugees 
who had owned their own farms and had viewed the future with optimism, who 
had bought a piano for their living room and a new Model T Ford for the family, now 
lived in government camps if they were lucky, and under bridges if they were not, and 
followed the crops from one farm to another. Most of the Dust Bowl refugees survived 
on the margins of society until the new industrial jobs created by World War II ended 
the Depression for them. 
The Works Progress Administration and the Artists’ New Deal 
In April 1935, Congress created the Works Progress Administration (WPA) to institutionalize 
and expand the New Deal. Roosevelt appointed Harry Hopkins, a former 
settlement house worker and one of FDR’s closest advisors, to lead it. Th e WPA’s role 
was to move people from emergency relief (“the dole,” as the president called it) to 
temporary, government-supported jobs and to make the government the employer of 
last resort. Under Hopkins’s leadership, the WPA provided government-funded jobs 
for 8.5 million Americans at a cost of $11 billion between 1935 and 1942. WPA workers 
built roads, theaters, public buildings, and in some cases planned communities in 
every state of the Union as well as planted forests, laid out new parks, and changed 
the face of the countryside. Providing WPA jobs also provided opportunities for 
Roosevelt’s political allies—usually Democrats, but in some cases, such as New York 
City’s liberal Republican Mayor Fiorello La Guardia, also Republicans—to win political 
favors by handing out the coveted jobs to political supporters. 
At the urging of Eleanor Roosevelt, Hopkins included jobs for artists in the WPA. 
In response to one critic of the artists program, Hopkins said, “Hell, they’ve got to eat 
just like other people.” In 1935 and 1936, WPA artists painted murals in post offi ces; 
provided music through symphony orchestras, jazz groups, Appalachian banjo pickers, 
and Texas fi ddlers; staged theater productions of everything from Shakespeare 
to new cutting-edge works; wrote guidebooks to every part of the United States; and 
recorded the oral histories of former slaves, among many other projects. Besides 
ensuring that many artists were able to eat and practice their craft, the WPA art 
programs left a lasting cultural legacy, though not one without criticism. 
Other federal agencies also hired artists. Rexford Tugwell, one of the most 
infl uential members of the Brain Trust, charged the Farm Security Administration 
with creating a “Pictorial Sourcebook of American Agricultural History.” Between 
1935 and 1939, a team of photographers, including several who later became famous 
for their work—Dorothea Lange, Walker Evans, and Ben Shahn—roamed the country 
creating a picture of oft en-hidden rural poverty. 
Organized Labor, the Committee for Industrial Organization, and 
the Factory Floor 
Many labor union leaders were not sure they trusted Roosevelt and the New Deal in the 
early years. However, although the primary purpose of the National Industrial Recovery 
Act of June 1933 was to stabilize prices, at Roosevelt’s insistence, it also included a clause 
protecting collective bargaining through unions. Th e National Labor Relations Act of 
1935 (the Wagner Act) sponsored by New York Senator Robert Wagner, expanded the 
rights of union members, outlawing “unfair labor practices” as well as giving workers 
the right to join a union without getting fi red, rights to collective bargaining, and the 
right to strike. For the next decade, unions could be relatively sure that the federal government 
would not intervene in a strike on the side of management, as it had done 
repeatedly in the past. Th e Wagner Act did not create any unions, but it did provide a 
new context; labor organizers took the next steps on their own.

In 1935, when the Wagner Act was passed, only about 10 percent of American 
workers were union members, mostly in the skilled craft unions of the American 
Federation of Labor (A.F. of L.). Within the A.F. of L. some of its leaders, John L. 
Lewis of the United Mine Workers of America, Sidney Hillman of the Amalgamated 
Clothing Workers, and David Dubinsky of the International Ladies’ Garment Workers 
Union, pushed the A.F. of L. to organize the unorganized. Lewis and his colleagues 
wanted industrial unions that would organize a union of all the workers in an industry 
such as steel or automobiles or textiles, as opposed to the craft unions that focused on 
a single trade—carpenters, plumbers, or electricians. But the leadership of the A.F. of 
L. would have none of it. Th ey meant to protect their current members. 
Lewis, Hillman, and Dubinsky created a Committee for Industrial Organization 
within the A.F. of L. When other union leaders within the A.F. of L. continued to resist 
their efforts, the Committee for Industrial Organization became the Congress of 
Industrial Organizations (CIO), a separate union and a competitor to the A.F. of L. 
John L. Lewis, founding president of the CIO, could be tough, arbitrary, arrogant, 
and self-absorbed. He also was able to speak to workers as no one since Eugene Debs 
and Mother Jones. Lewis believed that by the 1930s a “mighty surge of human sentiment” 
was about to change industrial America. 
Sometimes the “mighty surge” got ahead of those who were trying to lead it. Across 
the country, workers, even many who had not yet joined a union, launched a new kind 
of strike—the sit-down strike. Instead of walking off the job and onto the picket lines, 
CIO-inspired workers simply stopped work and sat down where they were. In doing so, 
they guaranteed that they could not be replaced by nonunion workers, and they were 
hard to attack without harming the machinery they were guarding. Th ey were also much 
more comfortable inside the plant than outside. It turned out to be a brilliant tactic. 
One of the fi rst sit-down strikes took place in Akron, Ohio, at the Firestone Tire 
Plant on January 29, 1936. Aft er the workers sat down where they were and the noise 
of the assembly line stopped, one worker said of the silence, “It’s like the end of the 
world.” Th e Firestone workers stayed where they were for 3 days and won. 
Th e CIO reported a surge of telephone calls, “We’ve sat down! Send someone over 
to organize us!” From September 1936, through the following spring, 485,000 workers 
engaged in sit-down strikes. Th e CIO grew to 2 million members in 6 months. 
For most assembly line workers fortunate enough to have jobs in the 1930s, the 
primary complaint was not salary. As one Chevrolet worker told a NRA investigator 
in 1934, “Of course, we make enough to live on while we 
are working, but we don’t work enough time.” Workers 
on assembly lines also complained about constant speedups 
on the assembly lines. In an assembly-line industry, 
the pace of the line ruled everything. At Flint’s Fisher 
Body plant, a worker said, “I ain’t got no kick on wages, 
but I just don’t like to be drove.” 
On December 30, 1936, workers in two General 
Motors units in Flint, Michigan, stopped the line and sat 
down where they were. The Flint Sit-Down Strike had 
begun. By January 4, 1937, workers were sitting in at GM 
plants in Cleveland, Ohio; Atlanta, Georgia; Anderson, 
Indiana; Norwood, Ohio; and Kansas City, Missouri. It 
was the beginning of a long, cold winter. 
On January 11, the GM management turned the heat 
off even though it was 16 degrees outside. Police blocked 
a delivery of food. A group of about 30 strikers went to 
the main gate and broke through a police lock to get to 
supporters outside. The company called the Flint police, 
who fired tear gas. Strikers responded by throwing door 
hinges, bottles, and stones at the police. Th e United Auto

A new labor union that sought to organize 
industrial workers by industry, such as all 
automobile workers. 
Striking workers at a General Motors factory in Flint, Michigan, sit on car seats in 
front of unfi nished automobiles. The sit-down strike created a new form of labor 
union organizing.

Workers union (UAW) called it “the Battle of the Running Bulls.” Th e wind blew the 
tear gas back on the police. Th e gas and the continuing hail of missiles from the plant 
infuriated them, and they began shooting at strikers and picketers. Amazingly, no one 
was killed. Th e young wife of one striker, Genora Johnson, who was herself on the picket 
line, remembered, “I did not know fear. I knew only surprise, anguish, and anger.” 
Everyone—strikers and GM management—wondered about the ability of the 
strikers to continue. Most of those engaged in the sit-in were not yet union members, 
and few of them had ever been involved in a strike before, much less a protracted 
sit-in. But one remembered, “It was like war. Th e guys with me became my buddies.” 
Negotiations began in mid-January and on February 11 a settlement was reached. 
General Motors recognized the UAW’s right to represent its members, something 
the company had sworn never to do. It promised to negotiate in good faith on future 
contracts and that there would be no punishment of workers because of the sit-down. 
The union ended the strike. The United Automobile Workers Journal said of the 
settlement, “Th e greatest strike in American history has been victoriously concluded.” 
One striker said it more modestly, “Even if we got not one damn thing out of it other 
than that, we at least had a right to open our mouths without fear.” 
Opponents of the New Deal 
Not everyone celebrated the union’s victory over General Motors or other results of 
the New Deal. In July 1934, the du Pont brothers, Pierre, Irénée, and Lammot, invited 
a number of business and political leaders, including the 1928 Democratic nominee 
Al Smith, to New York to discuss “the dangers to investors” in the New Deal. Th e du 
Ponts, who also owned a major share of General Motors, had many reasons to dislike 
the Roosevelt administration. Th ey and their guests created the American Liberty 
League to oppose the New Deal. 
Irénée du Pont said that the family had “followed the President in the belief that 
he was sincere,” but thought that “the so-called New Deal” was nothing more or less 
than the socialistic doctrine. Al Smith, once Roosevelt’s mentor, told those at a Liberty 
League dinner that he would probably “take a walk” (not participate) during the 
next presidential election and accused Roosevelt of handing the government over to 
dreamy professors and bleeding-heart social workers. A league publication said that 
the New Deal stirred up the “dragon teeth of class warfare.” Other members of the 
American Liberty League included John J. Raskob, a former Democratic Party chair, 
who had been an executive at General Motors and the DuPont corporation; John W. 
Davis, the 1924 Democratic presidential nominee; Alfred P. Sloan of General Motors; 
and Sewell Avery of Montgomery Ward. (Herbert Hoover declined to join, derogatorily 
calling the League the “Wall Street model of human liberty.”) 
Th e National Association of Manufacturers also became a tough opponent of the 
New Deal. Th e association was created before 1900 to coordinate business opposition 
to labor unions. With the advent of the New Deal, leaders of the organization sought 
to “serve the purposes of business salvation,” and by 1937, were spending $1.5 million 
a year on radio programs, motion pictures, bill boards, direct mail, and speakers, 
attacking the New Deal. 
While conservative critics of the New Deal said that it was driving the country 
toward socialism, Roosevelt worried much more about other critics; those who 
thought the New Deal was not socialistic enough. Th e Communist Party was always 
unhappy with Roosevelt. Communists dismissed the New Deal as mere “bourgeois 
democracy.” Communists created unemployment councils, led rent strikes, and 
defended union members and civil rights workers. Although the party was small, it 
was not without infl uence in the 1930s. 
Many noncommunists also wanted to push the country further than Roosevelt 
wanted to go. Socialists, who were the heirs of Eugene V. Debs Socialist Party, as well 
as many Midwestern progressives who had supported Th eodore Roosevelt in 1912 
American Liberty League 
Launched in 1934, the group was one of 
the largest and most well funded of several 
organizations opposed to the New Deal, 
which it considered socialistic.

and Wisconsin Senator Robert La Follette’s bid for president in 1924, talked of a thirdparty 
challenge in 1936. 
A 66-year-old Californian, Dr. Francis Townsend, proposed a federal pension of $200 
per month to any person over 60 years old who would retire from work, leaving a job open 
for someone younger. Th e idea spread like wildfi re. A number of candidates were elected to 
Congress in 1934 with Townsend’s support. In addition, there were some 5,000 Townsend 
Clubs around the country, and 25 million people signed Townsend petitions to Congress. 
While Townsend’s ideas were gaining political traction, the muckraking author 
Upton Sinclair announced that he would seek the Democrat i c nomination for governor 
of California in 1934 based on a pledge to “End Poverty in California” (EPIC). 
Like the Townsend movement, the EPIC campaign took off among voters who were 
impatient with the New Deal. Sinclair won the nomination, received widespread support—
though not from Roosevelt, who saw EPIC as an eff ort to confi scate private 
property—and helped shape the national dialogue, even though he lost the election. 
More infl uential than Townsend or Sinclair, the “radio priest” Charles Coughlin 
inspired some and frightened others in the early 1930s. Coughlin had been appointed 
pastor of a small Catholic parish in the working class Detroit suburb of Royal Oak in 
1926. Catholic auto workers formed the core of his congregation. Coughlin arranged 
for the local radio station to broadcast his Sunday sermons, and in 1930, their popularity 
led to a contract with the Columbia Broadcasting System to carry him nationally 
(and led the anti-Catholic Klan to burn a cross on his lawn). As the Depression worsened, 
Coughlin’s sermons became more political. He relentlessly attacked Hoover and 
the nation’s bankers, and he described himself as the voice of “the little people, the 
average man [who] was suff ering.” Given the size of his radio audience, Roosevelt was 
delighted that Coughlin supported his 1932 campaign. 
Aft er the election, the two met at the White House, but Coughlin later turned on 
the New Deal. He accused FDR of having “out-Hoovered Hoover” and talked of organizing 
his own political party. His sermons took on an increasingly anti-Semitic and 
isolationist tone, and some thought he was starting to sound like the new German 
Chancellor Adolph Hitler. 
In Roosevelt’s mind, however, the greatest challenge came from Louisiana’s 
charismatic Senator Huey P. Long. Long was a product of the pine woods region of 
Louisiana where poverty, the Baptist church, and political independence fl ourished. 
Long’s forbearers had supported the Union cause during the Civil War and Eugene 
V. Debs during the early 1900s. In 1928, as Al Smith was going down to defeat, Long 
was elected governor of Louisiana aft er a campaign attacking big corporations, especially 
Standard Oil. Long’s grass-roots populism led him to attack the rich and promise 
opportunity for the poor. “Every man a king, but no one wears a crown,” was his 
campaign slogan. He raised taxes on oil and gas production, built new highways, 
schools, and hospitals, provided free textbooks, and grew very popular and very powerful. 
Some said that Louisiana under Long was a virtual dictatorship. He was elected 
to the U.S. Senate in 1930. In Washington, he showed disdain for Democrats as well 
as Republicans, called the president “Frank,” much to FDR’s displeasure, and said that 
all he cared about was “what the boys at the forks of the creek think of me.” Th ere 
were a lot of boys and girls at the forks of a lot of creeks who thought a lot of Long. 
FDR considered him a dangerous demagogue. 
In 1934, Long launched what he called the Share Our Wealth Society. Long promised 
a one-time grant of $5,000 per family and a guaranteed income of $2,500 (twice the 
1934 national average) as well as educational subsidies for the young and pensions for 
the elderly (specifi cally designed to attract Townsend support) all to be paid for by seizing 
the wealth of the few. When people said his numbers did not add up, that there was 
not enough wealth to seize even if people wanted to, Long responded that his followers 
needed to “be prepared for the slurs and snickers of some high ups.” But, he insisted, 
“Let no one tell you that it is diffi cult to redistribute the wealth of this land. It is simple.”

While the Communists and Socialists did not cause Roosevelt to worry, Townsend, 
Coughlin, and Long did. Th e president worried about a dictatorship emerging in the 
United States, just as dictatorships had emerged as a result of the Depression in Italy 
and Germany. Democratic Chairman James Farley commissioned a poll that showed 
that a third-party ticket led by Long could lead to Roosevelt’s defeat in 1936 and perhaps 
even a Long victory, if not in 1936 then by 1940. Th ere was plenty to worry about. “Long 
plans to be a candidate of the Hitler type for the presidency in 1936,” Roosevelt said. Th e 
president reshaped his political agenda to take control of the national dialogue. 
The Continuing Depression and the Expanding New Deal, 1935–1939 
During Roosevelt’s fi rst 100 days, indeed his fi rst 2 years, the New Deal consisted of a 
series of experiments, some contradictory, some well thought out, but all designed to 
stem the worst of the Depression and begin a new course—to keep people from starving, 
to put them back to work, to get more money into circulation. In 1935 there was a 
shift in focus; some called it the “Second New Deal.” It was not a radical change, but it 
did involve greater attention to long-term fi nancial security for more Americans. 
Before accepting the job as FDR’s secretary of labor, Frances Perkins had insisted 
that the president promise to back pensions for the aging and unemployment insurance. 
In an early meeting, Roosevelt told Perkins, “I will authorize you to try, and if you 
succeed, that’s fi ne.” It was all the authorization she needed. Perkins had witnessed the 
tragic Triangle Shirtwaist Fire in New York in 1911 and had led the investigation that 
followed and helped craft some of the health and safety legislation that emerged from 
it. Th e growth and popularity of the Townsend movement gave Perkins more political 
clout than she might otherwise have had. If a plan could be devised that was fi nancially 
viable (unlike the Townsend plan), then 1934 and 1935 was the time to get it passed. 
Roosevelt worried about amassing too much power in the federal government. He 
insisted that the states play the lead role in unemployment insurance though he was 
willing to have a federal role. But he was adamant, “All the power shouldn’t be in 
the hands of the federal government. Look—just think what would happen if all the 
power was concentrated here, and Huey Long became president!” Treasury Secretary 
Henry Morgenthau was determined that any plan be fi scally viable. But many in the 
administration thought Townsend had a point: the country did need to encourage 
older Americans to retire and leave their jobs to younger people. And Perkins was 
determined to get a bill through Congress.

On January 17, 1935, FDR announced plans for a Social Security program that would 
protect some 26 million citizens with “security against the hazards and vicissitudes of life.” 
Th e proposed bill included a federal tax on employees and employers to fund the retirement 
system, a federal tax to help support a state-administered unemployment insurance 
system, and emergency grants to fund the immediate relief of the indigent elderly, Aid 
to Dependent Children, and modest support for public health. Since the Constitution 
clearly gave the government the right to tax, there was no room for a constitutional 
challenge to the legislation. Congress passed the Social Security Act 7 months later on 
August 14, 1935. Th e proposed Social Security Act included a federal tax on employees 
and employers to fund the retirement system. In January 1940, the fi ft h anniversary of 
Roosevelt’s speech about the program, Ida M. Fuller, a 76 year old woman living in 
Vermont, received the fi rst Social Security check. 
As Roosevelt prepared for the reelection battle of 1936, he also toughened his rhetoric. 
In his 1933 inaugural address, FDR had criticized “the rulers of the exchange 
of mankind’s goods” for having “failed, through their own stubbornness and their 
own incompetence.” In 1936, however, his speeches took on a harsher tone. He spoke 
of his “old enemies,” the bankers and profi teers, and condemned their “greed” and 
“autocracy.” He said of business leaders, “Th ey are unanimous in their hate for me— 
and I welcome their hatred.” 
Social Security Act 
Legislation that established a system of 
federal old-age pensions in effect to the 
present day. 
Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins took the lead in creating the 
Social Security retirement system, still in operation today. Years 
later, she looked back on the work she did. 
[T]he real roots of the Social Security Act were in the Great 
Depression of 1929. Nothing else would have bumped the 
American people into a social security system except something 
so shocking, so terrifying, as that Depression.… 
But everything was down. Nobody could get a job. The grocer 
didn’t employ the young boys to deliver goods any more. He 
couldn’t afford to. The grocer himself finally went bankrupt and 
closed up. He had given too much credit. I mean the people who 
were out of work had credit at the grocery store at first and they 
could eat; but they couldn’t pay their bills, and finally, the grocer 
couldn’t pay his bills; and eventually somebody came and sold 
him out. It went on like that all the time.… 
In the spring of 1932, Franklin Roosevelt had gone out to Utah 
to the Conference of Governors.…He made a speech which was 
full of pleasant hyperbole of one sort or another—flattery to various 
Governors—but at one point he began to discuss the great 
problems now facing this country, and he spoke about unemployment. 
Then he said, “I am for unemployment insurance but 
not for the dole.” 
Until we heard those words come over the wires, I wasn’t sure 
he was going to say he was for unemployment insurance. I was 
afraid he was going to say he was against the dole, and nothing 
else.…It created a great interest and a great enthusiasm among 
the voters, which he was not slow to catch on to. He had that 
kind of a mind, you know; he could feel the public pulse, and he 
cared about the public pulse.… 
At any rate, we worked all summer.…It was a terribly hot 
summer and everybody worked hard all the time and finally we 
actually did bring forth a report…that recommended unemployment 
insurance and old-age insurance but omitted health insurance 
just because the experts couldn’t get through with health 
insurance in time to make a report on it.… 
This, then, was the genesis of the whole bill. We did a great deal 
of educating by one kind of propaganda or other, chiefly hearings. 
Senator Wagner put it up—a bill which he called a model bill—and 
held public hearings in the Senate, which attracted a great deal of 
attention from the Senators. We had a number of senatorial committees 
which we asked to look into this or that. We got advice. All 
these actions were for the purpose, not so much of advice as of 
propaganda—that is, of education of the public.…The result was 
a bill that finally was presented to Congress and, as you know, was 
debated very briefly.…And finally, we did get the basic bill passed.

Roosevelt attacked business leaders every chance he got during 1935 and 1936, 
but he did not actually do very much to hurt them. Nevertheless, his rhetoric stole 
the thunder from Coughlin’s and Long’s; his legislation, especially Social Security, 
undermined Townsend’s organization; and his support for the Wagner Act created 
great loyalty among labor unions. As a result, Roosevelt amassed great political capital 
going into the 1936 presidential election. 
Huey Long was assassinated in September 1935. Aft er his death, his Share Our 
Wealth clubs became the Union Party, which nominated William Lemke, a congressman 
from North Dakota, for president. Th e Republicans nominated the liberal Kansas 
Governor Alf Landon. In spite of polls, including one by the Literary Digest that predicted 
a Landon win, Roosevelt won a stunning electoral victory in November 1936. 
He carried 46 of the nation’s 48 states and a huge plurality of the popular vote. 
As he began his second term in January 1937, the president seemed to turn the 
agenda back to fi ghting the ongoing Depression. In his inaugural address he said, “I see 
one-third of a nation, ill-housed, ill-clad, ill-nourished.” It was a call to action but also 
an admission that in 4 years the New Deal had not accomplished all that it hoped for. 
In spite of his extraordinary election victory and the high hopes for more permanent 
reform it engendered, Roosevelt accomplished far less in his second term than 
in the fi rst. Th e sense of national crisis was not as great in 1937, and Roosevelt’s own 
missteps got in the way. 
One of FDR’s greatest frustrations was the fact that a conservative U.S. Supreme 
Court kept undermining his eff orts. Late in his fi rst term, the court declared the NRA 
and then the AAA unconstitutional, as well as state minimum wage laws. Court challenges 
to Social Security and the Wagner Act were working their way through the 
lower courts. He was not sure what would come next. In early February 1937 aft er 
his reelection, Roosevelt went to Congress with a proposal that would allow him to 
appoint one additional Supreme Court Justice for every member who was over the 
age of 70—which in 1937 would mean six new justices—and similar numbers in the 
lower courts. Th e Constitution never mentions a number of justices for the court, and 
the number had fl uctuated between fi ve and ten. FDR’s proposal was completely constitutional 
but politically very unwise. FDR claimed that the goal was to speed judicial 
review and reduce the workload of the justices. Everyone knew that, in fact, there was 
only one goal: to stop the court from overturning the New Deal. 
To many in Congress, not only conservatives, the court-packing bill was a step 
toward dictatorship. For some southern senators, it would open up the way to civil 
rights legislation, which they always feared might someday emerge from the White 
House. Montana Senator Burton Wheeler, an old progressive who usually sided with 
the president, led the assault, claiming that the bill “cut down those guarantees of 
liberty written by the blood of your forefathers.” Th e legislation was defeated by the 
friends of the New Deal before its enemies got a chance to join in the debate. 
Ironically, while Congress defeated Roosevelt’s plan to expand—or “pack”— 
the Supreme Court, the justices, perhaps reading the 1936 election returns, shift ed 
ground. Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes and Associate Justice Owen Roberts, 
who had both voted against the New Deal, changed their minds, fi rst on a minimum 
wage law and then on the all-important Wagner Labor Relations Act, which the court 
found to be constitutional. Th e changes in the Hughes and Robert votes were dubbed 
“the switch in time that saved nine.” Aft er 1937, although no new justices were added, 
the court stopped declaring New Deal legislation unconstitutional. 
Nevertheless, with the defeat of Roosevelt’s court plan, the momentum behind 
the New Deal slowly came to a stop. Divisions in Congress engendered by the 
court plan never healed. Unemployment actually rose in 1937 and 1938 in the 
“Depression within a Depression,” which most likely occurred due to Roosevelt’s 
eff ort to balance the federal budget by cutting back on the federal spending that was 
keeping the economy moving. Congress did pass a bill to resurrect parts of the old 
AAA now that the court seemed more open to it. A Fair Labor Standards Act that

prohibited child labor and set an hourly minimum wage and a 40-hour work week 
also passed. However, Congress defeated a plan to expand the Tennessee Valley 
Authority to other regions of the country and a reorganization plan for the executive 
branch of the government that FDR wanted. When the president signed the Fair 
Labor Standards Act in June 1938, he was heard to say, “Th at’s that.” Th e New Deal, 
it seemed, had come to an end even if the Depression that launched it would run on 
for another year or more. 
Th e New Deal did not end the Great Depression. Th e economy rebounded only as 
the United States prepared for World War II and government spending in preparation 
for war far outpaced anything that had been spent to “prime the pump” during the 
1930s. Nevertheless, the New Deal changed the country. Th e Glass-Steagall Act and 
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation stabilized the nation’s banking system, 
and the CCC and other agencies put people to work who desperately wanted— 
needed—jobs. Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt’s optimism gave people hope, and the 
president’s commitment helped keep democratic institutions alive at a time when 
they were under assault not only in Europe and Asia but also in the United States. 
Th e federal government since has never shrunk to its pre-New Deal size when the 
Post Offi ce was the largest government agency. Social Security and federal regulatory 
agencies play a continuing role in the economy and in people’s lives. Including women 
and African-Americans in more than token positions within any administration 
is now the norm. The New Deal also inspired a new conservative movement and 
philosophy as opponents of the New Deal, especially business leaders, began to attack 
the new government intervention in the economy that the New Deal launched. While 
historians will long debate the value and the impact of the New Deal, all agree that the 
United States was a very diff erent place in 1939 than it had been in 1929.

What other paths might the country have followed?

THE DEEP ROOTS OF WAR—THE UNITED STATES, EUROPE, 
AND ASIA 
Analyze the international impact of the Depression, German and Japanese military 
expansion, and the initial U.S. response. 
While the United States emerged from World War I relatively unscathed, much of 
Europe was devastated, and the Treaty of Versailles caused signifi cant lingering pain 
and anger, most of all among the defeated Germans. When a worldwide Depression 
came, suff ering, fear, and resentment all planted the seeds of another far greater 
confl ict. 
In Europe, some of the earliest signs of the postwar ill will appeared in Italy. In 
1922, the leader of the ultranationalist Italian Fascist Party, Benito Mussolini, became 
prime minister. “Il Duce” (the leader), as he called himself, ruled Italy with an iron 
fi st for more than 20 years. Mussolini’s dream was to restore Italy’s ancient glory by 
building prosperity and reestablishing the ancient Roman Empire, especially in North 
Africa, starting with Ethiopia. 
For Germany, the 1920s were a terrible decade. Th e German Weimar Republic 
governed a defeated country. Hyperinfl ation between 1921 and 1924 made German 
currency virtually worthless. Shift ing government coalitions were not able to create 
stability, especially in the face of the country’s need to pay some $33 billion in reparations—
payments that Britain and France used to pay their own $10 billion debt to the 
United States. In the late 1920s, as the worldwide depression worsened, the German 
economy collapsed under the load of debt payments and infl ation. Banks closed in 
Germany and Austria. President Herbert Hoover described the German bank crisis of

While Franklin Roosevelt was a very popular president, 
the only one in history elected to the office four times 
and always by large margins, at no time was his administration 
without opposition, especially as he faced the 1936 election. 
Some opponents thought Roosevelt was not moving nearly 
far or fast enough to use the opportunity presented by the 
Great Depression to restructure the American economy; others 
thought he was moving far too quickly and too radically. 
Among those who wanted FDR to do more, Louisiana Senator 
Huey Long told a 1935 audience that he had “begged and 
pleaded and did everything else under the sun [to] try to get Mr. 
Roosevelt to keep his word that he gave us.” But Long said he 
had concluded that there was no reason left to trust Roosevelt. 
“[H]e has promised and promised, smiled and bowed.…There 
is no use to wait three more years. It is not Roosevelt or ruin, 
it is Roosevelt’s ruin.” In another speech, Long was especially 
clear on the differences, asking Iowa farmers, “Do you believe 
in the redistribution of wealth?” and basking in their cheers. 
In contrast, the New York Times for August 23, 1934, carried 
a different story. With a headline that read, “League is Formed 
to Scan New Deal, ‘Protect Rights,’” the newspaper reported, 
“A group of prominent Democrats joined a few Republicans 
today to incorporate the American Liberty League, intended, 
according to its incorporators, to combat radicalism, preserve 
property rights, uphold and preserve the Constitution.” For 
Roosevelt’s old mentor Al Smith, the New Deal was becoming 
a danger to American liberty.

1931 as “a gigantic explosion which shook the foundations of the world’s economic, 
political, and social structure.” Anger at the economic and political failure in Germany 
fueled old hatreds and brought a new political party to power in Germany. 
Adolph Hitler’s Nazi (or National Socialist) Party grew from a group of street 
thugs, known as Brown Shirts, in the 1920s, to a formidable group leading to 
Hitler’s election in January 1933 as German Chancellor, with 44 percent of the vote, 
just before Roosevelt became president. Hitler promised that a greatly expanded 
German nation would provide Lebensraum (living space) for people of German 
nationality by pushing other peoples, Slavs and Jews, out of the way to make room 
for the “master race.” 
A month aft er coming to offi ce, on February 27, 1933, the Nazi Party issued a decree 
ending free speech and assembly in Germany. Th ey arrested Communist deputies in 
the German Parliament, giving themselves a solid majority there. Hitler took the title 
der Fuhrer , the leader. Later that year, just as the United States was implementing the 
prolabor New Deal, the Nazi government outlawed trade unions and other political 
parties. Th ey authorized a new police force, the Geheime Staatspolizei or Gestapo, to 
enforce Nazi authority. In 1935, as the U.S. Congress was passing the Social Security 
Act and the Wagner Act, the Nazi Parliament passed the Nuremberg Decrees, which 
took away the citizenship of German Jews, excluded Jews from most professions and 
the military, and made the marriage of a Jew and non-Jew illegal. In November 1938, 
in a well-orchestrated attack across Germany known as Kristallnacht (or crystal night 
for all the broken glass), crowds attacked Jewish stores, homes, and synagogues while 
the government arrested some 20,000 Jews. Th e Nazi government then ordered an 
“atonement fi ne” on Jews to pay for the cost of Kristallnacht, closed Jewish stores, and 
a short time later, confi scated all Jewish property. Before long, Germany’s Jews, and 
then those in Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and other territories under German 
control, were being forced to wear yellow stars to identify them. Th ey were packed 
into tightly controlled urban ghettos, and within 2 years, the fi rst of them were being 
transported to slave labor and death camps. 
Kristallnacht, November 9, 1938, was a Nazi Party-inspired attack on Jewish businesses and synagogues 
across Germany. It was the beginning of worse to come for Jews in Nazi-controlled countries. 

Chapter 22 Living in Hard Times 685 
While the German government was attacking its Jewish citizens, Hitler also 
renounced the clause in the Treaty of Versailles calling for German disarmament and 
began to build a new army. A year later, in March 1936, Hitler’s army marched into 
the German Rhineland, which in the terms of the Treaty of Versailles was supposed 
to be kept free of troops. Two years later, in March 1938, Hitler announced that the 
independent country of Austria was to be known as the German province of Ostmark, 
and German troops marched into Austria. On March 14, 1938, Hitler rode in triumph 
through Vienna, welcomed as a hero by many. 
Hitler did not stop there. Since the Sudeten region of Czechoslovakia had a large 
German population (though still a minority), Hitler claimed that they had the right under 
the Treaty of Versailles—which he otherwise ignored—to self-determination and should 
be incorporated into Germany. Aft er a summer of negotiations and with British agreement, 
Hitler annexed the Sudeten region. Th e following spring, in March 1939, Hitler sent the 
German army into the rest of Czechoslovakia and made a triumphant journey to Prague. 
As Nazi power grew in Germany and fascism continued its hold on Italy, the two 
countries formalized their alliance with the Rome-Berlin Axis treaty of November 
1936. A few months earlier, in July 1936, another Fascist, Spanish General Francisco 
Franco, commander of the Spanish Army garrison in Morocco, led an attack on the 
left -leaning and democratically elected Republican government of Spain. Spain was 
engulfed in a bloody civil war. Th e governments of Germany and Italy sent planes and 
troops to aid Franco. Th e communist government of Russia and western governments 
sent modest aid to the Republicans. But by early 1939, the Fascists had won. Spain 
joined Italy and Germany, forming a powerful fascist bloc. 
While Fascists were consolidating their power in central Europe, militarists in 
Japan were also growing in power. Japanese militarism had a strong anti-American 
strain as various American policies—from the exclusion of Japanese children from 
San Francisco schools in 1906 to the exclusion of all Japanese immigrants as a result 
of the 1924 immigration law—sparked continuing anger even as people in the United 
States forgot those incidents. 
In the 1910s and 1920s, as Japanese power grew, Japan declared a goal of “Asia for 
Asians,” which meant Japanese domination of the whole of the western rim of the Pacifi c 
Ocean to replace Britain, France, and the United States as dominant powers. Many 
Asians resented U.S. control of the Philippine Islands, British involvement in China and 
Burma, Dutch control of the oil-rich East Indies, and French control of Indochina (modern 
Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia). Except in China, where Japanese advances were 
deeply resented, the Japanese conquests were oft en welcomed in the rest of Asia. 
By the 1930s, Japan faced the same worldwide depression conditions as other 
industrialized countries. Japan saw its economic salvation in expansion. Th e island 
nation could not provide enough food for its people and lacked key natural resources 
such as iron and oil. If the Europeans could have Asian colonies, its leaders asked, why 
not Japan? In September 1932, Japan used an explosion at a Japanese-owned railway 
in China as an excuse to send troops into China, and they installed a puppet government 
in the Chinese province of Manchuria. Th en in July 1937, Japanese troops 
captured Shanghai, the largest city in China, and the Chinese capital of Nanking. Th e 
Rape of Nanking, as the Japanese attack was called, was a brutal assault. As many as 
300,000 Chinese were killed as the Japanese army raped, beheaded, machine-gunned, 
and bayoneted civilians. Th e Chinese government led by Chiang Kai-shek retreated 
and set up a new capital in the inland city of Chungking. Japan renamed the expanded 
territory in Manchuria as the Japanese province of Manchukuo. A half a million 
Japanese moved into the territory to farm and govern the subjected Chinese population. 
At the same time, Chiang’s Kuomintang Party (the Nationalists) was locked in a 
bitter civil war with the Chinese Community Party led by Mao Zedong. 
In the face of so much worldwide violence and aggression, the governments of 
Great Britain, France, and the United States did virtually nothing while the League of 
Nations proved to be a meaningless barrier to aggression. Th e government of France 
22.3 
22.1

686 Part VII War, Prosperity, and Depression, 1890–1945 
ordered the construction of the supposedly “impregnable” Maginot Line 
(named for war minister André Maginot) along the border with Germany 
but did little more. When Hitler’s troops, in violation of the Versailles 
Treaty, marched into the Rhineland in 1936, Hitler wrote privately that, 
“If the French had then marched into the Rhineland, we would have had 
to withdraw with our tails between our legs.” But France did not act. 
The desire for peace was equally strong in Britain, driven by stillrecent 
memories of the bloodbath of World War I. If 420,000 British 
soldiers could die at the single and inconclusive Battle of the Somme in 
1916, the next generation was determined to avoid war. In 1933, students 
at Oxford University voted, “Th is house will in no circumstance fi ght 
for its King and its Country.” In 1935, several thousand young people 
in Britain joined the Peace Pledge Union, opposing any British military 
planning. When Mussolini invaded Ethiopia in 1935, Britain, which then 
controlled the Suez Canal, could have cut off the Italian troops by closing 
the canal, but did not do so. In spite of pleas from Ethiopia, the League of 
Nations did nothing. 
As late as September 1938, at a conference in Munich, Germany, 
British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain agreed to allow Hitler’s claim 
to the Sudetenland in exchange for a promise of peace. Chamberlain was 
greeted with large crowds in London when he returned promising “peace 
in our time.” In the British Parliament, however, Chamberlain was criticized 
by Winston Churchill who called the Munich agreement “a total and 
unmitigated defeat.” However, in 1938, Chamberlain, not Churchill, set 
British policy. 
As France and Britain did nothing to stop the Fascists, most people in the United 
States were even more determined to keep their distance from any conflict. During 
the 1920s and 1930s, a signifi cant majority of Americans wanted nothing to do with 
Europe’s or Asia’s problems. In 1935, George Earle, the governor of Pennsylvania, 
said, “If the world is to become a wilderness of waste, hatred, and bitterness, let us all 
the more earnestly protect and preserve our own oasis of liberty.” Minnesota Senator 
Th omas Schall said more succinctly, “To hell with Europe and the rest of those nations!” 
While isolationism was strongest in the Midwest, many people everywhere agreed. In 
April 1935, 50,000 World War I veterans marched for peace and laid wreaths on the 
graves of three members of Congress who had voted against U.S. entry into World War 
I. Days later, 175,000 college students staged a strike for peace. 
There were many reasons for the isolationism that was rampant in the United 
States in the 1930s. Most Americans had concluded that the many thousand American 
soldiers killed in the war had died for no reason. Wilson’s dream of a generation of 
peace sustained by the League of Nations was clearly a failure, and Europeans were 
once again at each other’s throats. Writers like John Dos Passos, Ernest Hemingway, 
and e.e. cummings all wrote novels about the meaninglessness of the First World War, 
and as Dos Passos said, “Rejection of Europe is what America is all about.” In the mid- 
1930s, a Senate Special Committee known as the Nye Committee, chaired by North 
Dakota’s Gerald Nye, concluded that big business had led the United States into the 
World War. In 1935, when President Roosevelt sought U.S. entry to the World Court, 
the Senate rejected the plan. Americans simply wanted nothing to do with the troubles 
of other nations. 
In Congress, the isolationist and peace sentiment led to the passage of a number 
of neutrality laws designed to keep the United States out of war. A 1935 law required 
an embargo of arms to all belligerents in any war while (in a direct slap at Woodrow 
Wilson’s policies) declaring that any American who traveled on a belligerent ship did 
so at his or her own risk. In 1936, Congress added a proviso that prohibited loans 
or credit to any nation at war, and in 1937, Congress explicitly extended the arms 
embargo to Spain. 
isolationism 
A belief that the United States should keep 
clear of nearly all involvement with the rest 
of the world, stay neutral and out of any 
foreign wars.

Chapter 22 Living in Hard Times 687 
Not every American shared the isolationist sentiments of the majority. In 1936 
and 1937, several thousand young Americans, mostly from various left-leaning 
movements, volunteered to fi ght in Spain on the side of the Republican government. 
Volunteers named themselves the Abraham Lincoln Brigade and joined an ill-trained 
and ill-equipped but courageous force that fought against the Fascists. In one battle 
near Madrid, 120 Americans died and another 175 were wounded. By the beginning 
of 1939, when the last Republican units were defeated, President Roosevelt himself 
concluded that neutrality in Spain had been a “grave mistake…as events will very 
likely prove.” 
While the Abraham Lincoln Brigade fought and President Roosevelt began to 
believe that the United States would eventually have to fi ght Fascism in Europe, most 
people in the country and the Congress continued to believe that they could stay out of 
all entanglements. When Congress passed the 1937 Neutrality Act, they toughened the 
prohibition on selling arms to any side and made it illegal for Americans to travel on a 
belligerent ship. Th e law also declared that nonmilitary material—food, clothing, and so 
on—could be sold to a nation at war only on a “cash and carry” basis, insisting that there 
be no loans to belligerents and that all goods bought in the United States had to be taken 
out of the country in non-U.S. ships. 
Th e neutrality legislation attempted to keep the United States out of a European 
war, but violence in Asia was growing. When Japan had attacked Manchuria in 1931, 
President Hoover’s Secretary of State Henry L. Stimson proclaimed the “Stimson 
Doctrine”: that the United States would never offi cially recognize the new regime in 
Manchukuo or any other arrangement imposed on China by force. Th e unstated part 
of the doctrine was that the United States also would not do anything much to enforce 
its policy. American public opinion was solidly on the side of China. Th e novelist Pearl 
Buck, author of Th e Good Earth published in 1931, and Henry Luce, the owner of the 
Time-Life publications, were both children of missionaries to China and between them 
did a lot to build public sympathy for China. In the fall of 1937, a Gallup poll showed 
that 59 percent of Americans favored China compared to 1 percent who favored Japan 
in the quest for control of Manchuria. But almost no one wanted to do more than off er 
sympathy to the Chinese. 
In December 1937, Japanese pilots sank the U.S. gunboat Panay in Nanking, 
China. While Americans were angry, they were not angry enough to challenge Japan. 
Aft er the Panay was sunk, Texas Congressman Maury Maverick said, “We should 
learn that it is about time for us to mind our own business,” and a poll showed 
that most Americans agreed with him. While Americans wanted to stay out of war, 
American scrap iron and American oil continued to be shipped to Japan, strengthening 
that country’s military. Since there was no formal war between Japan and China, 
the Neutrality Act did not apply, and most of the battles in Manchuria were fueled 
with American petroleum and bombs made of American metal. Indeed, through the 
late 1930s and into 1940 and 1941, Roosevelt and his cabinet feared not only American 
isolationists but also the wrath of Japan. If they were to cut off oil shipments—they 
did eventually cut metal shipments—they worried that Japan would quickly attack the 
Dutch colonies in Asia that were the only other potential source of oil for Japan. To 
keep the peace, the United States kept the oil fl owing. 
In the face of the Nazi attacks in Germany and then Austria and Czechoslovakia, 
many Jews tried to leave Europe. But leaving was not easy, and the strict quotas 
of the 1924 legislation made immigration to the United States very diffi cult. In the 
1930s, the American Jewish Congress protested loudly against both the Nazi attacks 
and American immigration policy. Th e group urged boycotts of German goods and 
staged a mock trial of Hitler. Roosevelt felt blocked by the immigration laws though 
he did combine the German and Austrian quotas, allowing some additional Jewish 
immigration in 1936 and 1937. Britain also allowed modest immigration but resolutely 
opposed further expansion of the Jewish population of Palestine, then governed 
by Britain under a League of Nations mandate. Nazi laws limited the amount 
22.3 
22.1 
22.2 

688 Part VII War, Prosperity, and Depression, 1890–1945 
of money a departing Jew could take to about $4, an amount that made 
a potential immigrant a pauper and therefore ineligible for admission 
to the United States. 
After Kristallnacht, the November 1938 attack on Jews, New York 
Senator Robert Wagner and House members Edith Nourse Rogers of 
Massachusetts and Emmanuel Celler of New York proposed legislation 
that would create an expanded quota for racial and religious refugees. 
However, as with China, most Americans offered sympathy but 
little more, and Congress followed public opinion, voting the proposal 
down. A 1939 poll showed that 85 percent of Protestants, 84 percent of 
Catholics, and even 25.8 percent of Jews opposed opening the United 
States to Jewish refugees from Europe. 
As the Nazi attacks on Jews escalated, European Jews became desperate 
to leave. In May 1939, the German ship St. Louis arrived in Havana 
with 930 Jewish refugees. The Cuban government refused temporary 
visas. The captain of the St. Louis then sailed up the U.S. coast, well 
within sight of Miami and other American cities, while negotiators tried 
desperately to get the U.S. State Department to allow the refugees to land. But the 
State Department would not agree and a Coast Guard cutter was ordered to intercept 
any St. Louis passengers who tried to go ashore. Finally in June, the St. Louis returned 
to Europe. Before the war ended, perhaps a quarter or more of the passengers had 
died in concentration camps. Most Americans were sympathetic to the plight of Jews, 
but anti-Semitism was also strong in America. 
Charles Lindbergh, the aviation hero of the 1920s, became an avid opponent of any 
revision of the neutrality laws or any support for Jewish refugees. Lindbergh became a 
popular speaker at rallies of the America First Committee that had been organized in the 
fall of 1940 to keep the United States out of war in Europe. Father Charles Coughlin, long an 
opponent of the New Deal, began calling it the “Jew-Deal.” For Lindbergh, Coughlin, and 
a signifi cant American following, Nazism was appealing. Others, probably the majority of 
the supporters of the America First Committee, simply did not want any part of a war that 
the United States could avoid. Nevertheless, not only isolationism and ignorance but also 
old hatreds kept the United States from providing the support for Europe’s Jews that they so 
badly needed. 
While Americans tried to ignore developments in Europe and Asia in the late 
1930s, Hitler was on the move. He understood that the faster he acted the greater his 
chances of success. Once Hitler invaded the rest of Czechoslovakia, Prime Minister 
Chamberlin, who had agreed to an earlier compromise, announced that Britain was 
committed to the defense of Poland and that if Hitler’s forces attacked that country, 
his forces would be met with armed resistance. 
In April 1939, Mussolini invaded Albania. Hitler made feints toward Poland. Th en 
in August, Hitler stunned the world by signing a nonaggression pact with Joseph 
Stalin, the dictator of the Soviet Union (as communist Russia was known). Th e erstwhile 
enemies—Germany and the Soviet Union with radically diff erent economic systems 
and ideologies—now agreed to the partition of Poland. Everyone knew what was 
coming next. In the State Department, one offi cial said that the feeling in the world was 
like “sitting in a house where somebody is dying upstairs.” Very early in the morning 
on September 1, 1939, President Roosevelt received a call, “Mr. President,” the U.S. 
Ambassador in France said, “several German divisions are deep in Polish territory…. 
Th ere are reports of bombers over the city of Warsaw.” Th e President replied, “It has 
come at last. God help us all!” 
Britain and France followed through on their promise to declare war. World War 
II had begun in Europe. On September 3, Roosevelt gave a radio fi reside chat in which 
he said that the United States would remain neutral, but “[e]ven a neutral cannot be 
asked to close his mind or close his conscience.” Th e country’s mind was certainly 
not neutral. Eighty-four percent of Americans supported Britain and France, only two

percent Germany. But a very large majority also wanted to stay out of the war no matter 
how much sympathy they might have for one side. Aft er September 1939, more 
Americans, led by the president, were starting to have grave doubts that staying out of 
the battle was going to be possible. 
Quick Review Considering how the United States was drawn into World War I, why might 
so many Americans have favored isolationism in the years leading up to World War II? 
CONCLUSION 
Th e stock market crash of 1929 was a dramatic and symbolic end to the prosperity of 
the 1920s, but it was not the fi rst sign that something was very wrong with the U.S. 
economy. Th roughout the 1920s, stock prices had risen dramatically, and by the end 
of 1928, the economy was showing signs of a speculative boom. Experts began to warn 
that a crash was inevitable, but American investors largely ignored these warnings. 
Finally, in October 1929, the bottom fell out of the market. Stock prices crashed and 
continued to crash for the next 3 years. Th e Great Depression was in full force. 
President Herbert Hoover’s response to the nation’s economic woes moved in 
the right direction, but it was too cautious and failed to alleviate the crisis or restore 
confi dence among Americans. In 1932, he was defeated for reelection by Franklin 
Roosevelt, who, once in offi ce, took swift action to stabilize the nation’s economy and 
its banking system, extend relief to the impoverished, and create jobs for the unemployed. 
Roosevelt, with the backing of the Democrats in Congress, passed nine separate 
pieces of legislation in his fi rst 100 days as president. Dubbed the “New Deal,” his 
agenda and policies provided important help for some Americans but did little for 
others. 
Th e New Deal did not end the Depression, but it did provide much needed social 
welfare, create jobs, shore up the banking system, improve working conditions, and 
install protective barriers against future economic downturns. Still, the New Deal 
was not supported by everyone, and Roosevelt faced powerful opponents on the right 
(who believed that the New Deal was socialism) and on the left (who believed that the 
New Deal was not progressive enough). Despite such opposition, Roosevelt was popular 
and was reelected in a landslide in 1936. 
By the end of the 1930s, the violence in Europe and Asia was demanding more 
and more attention. Fascists Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini had seized power in 
Germany and in Italy and had begun to threaten other states on the European continent. 
Similarly, Japan had begun a campaign of imperialist expansion in Asia. Most 
of this behavior initially went unchecked. Not until 1939, when Germany invaded 
Poland, did Britain and France declare war. Americans disagreed about how to 
respond to this aggression. At the end of the decade, U.S. involvement in another 
major European conflict seemed inevitable to some; however, others—probably a 
majority—wanted to stay out of Europe’s and Asia’s problems despite any sympathy 
they may have felt for the people in those situations.

Chapter 22 Summary and Review 
100 days in offi ce began with steps to stabilize the nation’s banking 
system. Under Roosevelt’s New Deal, program after program 
was created to provide relief to the destitute, jobs to the 
able bodied, and stability to the economy. Th e New Deal aff ected 
diff erent groups in American society in diff erent ways. Federal 
policy towards Native Americans was fundamentally reformed. 
Black Americans were hit especially hard by the Depression, a 
situation that was made worse by the diffi culties they faced gaining 
access to New Deal jobs and resources. Nonetheless, African- 
Americans made important advances in the 1930s. Farmers 
on the Great Plains faced the combined impact of economic 
and environmental disaster. Organized labor made dramatic 
gains as unions gained government support and protection for 
their activities. Th e New Deal was not embraced by everyone, 
and Roosevelt had powerful opponents on both the left and the 
right. As the election of 1936 approached, Roosevelt responded 
to his critics and to the continuing grip of the Depression with 
an expansion of the New Deal. Roosevelt accomplished far less 
in his second term than his fi rst, and the political momentum 
behind the New Deal lost steam.

THE COMING OF THE GREAT DEPRESSION

response to it. 
Summary 
The speculative boom that culminated in the stock market 
crash of 1929 was one of the many factors that triggered the 
Great Depression, but it was not its underlying cause. There 
were many fundamental weaknesses in the American economy. 
Poverty was widespread throughout the 1920s, particularly 
in rural communities. As the impact of the Depression deepened, 
farmers lost their land, the nation’s banking system began 
to collapse, and millions of Americans lost their jobs. Herbert 
Hoover’s initial response to the Depression was to call for voluntary 
actions by the fi nancial and business community and to 
take limited government action to ameliorate the Depression’s 
eff ects. Hoover’s actions proved ineff ective, and the American 
people lost confi dence in his leadership.

Summary 
Th e Treaty of Versailles did little to ease tensions and mistrust 
between European nations. Some of the earliest signs of postwar 
ill will appeared in Italy, where the leader of the ultranationalist 
Italian Fascist Party, Benito Mussolini, took power. In 
Germany, hard times hit in the early 1920s and then again at the 
end of the decade. It was against this backdrop of economic and 
political crisis that Adolph Hitler and the Nazis rose to power. 
Once in power, Hitler quickly moved to consolidate his dictatorship 
and to begin an assault on Germany’s Jews. He then 
began a process of remilitarization and expansionist aggression 
that took Europe to the brink of a second world war. While 
Fascists were consolidating their power in central Europe, militarists 
in Japan were also growing in power. In the response to 
Depression, Japan began a campaign of imperialist expansion 
in China and elsewhere. For much of the 1930s, the United 
States and Europe’s democracies did little or nothing to inhibit 
the growth of Fascist power in Europe and Asia. Th e invasion 
of Poland by Germany and the Soviet Union in 1939 proved to 
be the last straw, and it led France and Britain to declare war 
on Germany. Despite what was happening abroad, however, the 
vast majority of Americans wanted to stay out of the war.

692 Part VII War, Prosperity, and Depression, 1890–1945 
World War II started out with disaster for the United States after Japan attacked 
the U.S. Navy base at Pearl Harbor, sinking much of the Pacifi c fl eet. It would be a 
long time before the tide turned. 
1939–1945 
23 
On the morning of December 7, 1941, 350 Japanese airplanes 
attacked the sleeping port of Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, where much 
of the Pacifi c fl eet was anchored and where planes were lined up 
in close formation (to protect them against sabotage on the ground). In a 
few short hours, 2,500 soldiers and sailors were killed, 150 U.S. airplanes 
destroyed, and fi ve battleships as well as many others vessels were sunk. It 
was a devastating loss. 
Th e next day, Franklin Roosevelt addressed Congress, speaking of the 
attack as “a date which will live in infamy.” He asked for, and was given, a 
declaration of war against Japan. Hitler and Mussolini then declared war 
on the United States. Th e long wait was over. With the direct attack on the 
United States at Pearl Harbor, most isolationists and antiwar voices rallied 
to the president and the war eff ort. Every citizen would be touched by the 
war whether by serving in the military, working in war-related industries, or 
using ration stamps to buy food. It had been a long wait during the 2 years 
in which Roosevelt increased support for Britain, negotiated fi tfully with 
Japan, and inched toward war. Th is chapter traces the story of preparation 
between 1939 and 1941 and the nation’s full-scale involvement in World 
War II from December 1941 to the war’s end in August 1945.

PREPAREDNESS AND ISOLATION, 1939–1941 
Explain support for and opposition to the growing U.S. support for Britain and growing 
tensions with Japan. 
When Germany attacked Poland in September 1939, Britain and then France declared 
war on Germany. Europe was at war. Neither Japan nor the United States intervened. 
Aft er the rapid German defeat of Poland that fall, the winter of 1939–40 was known as 
the “Phony War” since there was so little fi ghting. Poland disappeared, split between 
Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. Britain and France waited for an attack they 
knew would come—and the war did not stay phony. 
The Battle of Britain 
At the beginning of 1940, Hitler hinted at peace initiatives, then in April invaded 
Denmark and Norway and quickly defeated both. On May 10, Germany unleashed 
its Blitzkrieg (lightning war) on Holland, Belgium, and Luxembourg, bombing 
Rotterdam into rubble and sending in airborne and ground troops. All three countries 
surrendered. 
On May 14, 1,800 German tanks crossed the border into France, overran the 
Maginot Line (see Chapter 22 ) , which turned out to be useless, and turned toward 
Paris. Italy joined Germany, declaring war on France on June 10. On June 22, 1940, 
France surrendered. For the next several years, Germany directly governed northern 
France, including Paris, while a puppet government, led by the aging French World 
War I hero, Marshall Philippe Petain, governed the southern part of France known as 
Vichy France from a capital in the town of Vichy. By the summer of 1940, Hitler was 
the master of Europe (see Map 23-1 ). 
Only Great Britain stood against Germany. As the German forces rushed toward 
Paris, they attempted to cut off a retreat by French and British armies. But 338,000 
British, French, and allied troops were evacuated from the beaches of Dunkirk, leaving 
nearly all equipment behind. In a radio broadcast, the new British Prime Minister 
Winston Churchill promised, “We shall go on to the end,” but he added, Britain would 
hold out “until in God’s good time, the new world, with all its power and might, [shall] 
step forth to the rescue and the liberation of the old.” It was a rescue that Churchill 
and Roosevelt tried hard to assure over the next 18 months. 
Aft er the defeat of France, Hermann Goering, Nazi air chief, announced, “Th e 
Fuhrer has ordered me to crush Britain with my Luftwaffe,” and he tried hard. 
Bombers attacked British coastal fortifi cations, airfi elds, and then in September 1940, 
began the terror bombing of London. Th e “Blitz,” as the British called it, eventually 
killed thousands of residents of Britain’s capital—6,000 in October alone. Edward R. 
Murrow, the voice of the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) based in London, 
gave Americans nightly reports that “London is burning.” Th e small British Air Force 
fought back. Churchill begged Roosevelt for more help. Roosevelt set about fi nding 
ways to provide it. 
Moving Toward Lend-Lease Legislation 
Every step that Roosevelt took brought hostility from neutrality advocates. Senior 
offi cers within the U.S. military worried that sending arms to Britain would undermine 
U.S. defenses. Secretary of War Henry H. Woodring was committed to a “fortress 
America” strategy, arming this country and ignoring the rest of the world. No one 
opposed Roosevelt’s support for Britain more than Charles Lindbergh, a hero from 
his 1920s fl ight across the Atlantic. In October 1939, Lindbergh said, “An ocean is a 
formidable barrier, even for modern aircraft .” Th e U.S. ambassador in London, Joseph P. 
Kennedy, predicted that Britain would quickly fall.

Republican leaders in Congress opposed any intervention, and they had a lot of 
public support. In July 1940, students at Yale University, supported by Midwestern 
business leaders, formed the America First Committee . Most America First supporters 
saw the new war as an extension of the last one, simply an intra-European battle 
for power and colonies. Some sympathized with the Nazis or hated Jews. Most distrusted 
Roosevelt. 
Roosevelt argued with the isolationists in Congress, ignored his ambassador 
in London as someone who “has been an appeaser and always will be an appeaser,” 
and thought Lindbergh was a Nazi. He promoted military officers who supported 
his eff orts and sidelined others. In 1940, FDR replaced isolationist Secretary of War 
Woodring with longtime internationalist Republican Henry L. Stimson, who had been 
secretary of war in Taft ’s administration and secretary of state for President Hoover. 
Roosevelt also added Frank Knox, another Republican internationalist, as secretary of 
the navy.

In the fall of 1940, FDR concluded a “ destroyers-for-bases ” deal, which circumvented 
congressional restrictions on selling ships to Britain by “trading” obsolete ships 
to Britain in exchange for 99-year leases on a string of British Navy bases. He pressured 
the navy to declare ships obsolete and defended the deal as a way to strengthen 
America’s defenses. However, he also worried that he had exceeded his constitutional 
authority, and his opponents worried even more. 
As war raged in Europe, the November 1940 presidential election loomed. 
Roosevelt broke precedent going back to George Washington and sought a third 
term. Th e Democrats, aft er some grumbling, mostly by supporters of Vice President 
John Garner, nominated Roosevelt. The Republicans, wanting to avoid having an 
isolationist candidate, nominated a corporate attorney and utility company executive, 
Wendell Willkie, an ardent opponent of the New Deal who did not disagree with 
Roosevelt greatly on foreign policy, though he did denounce the destroyers-for-bases 
deal as “the most arbitrary and dictatorial action ever taken by any president.” 
In the middle of the campaign, Roosevelt asked Congress to institute a military 
draft so the country could have a trained army ready in case of war. Many opposed 
the draft, but when a reporter told Willkie that, “if you want to win the election 
you will come out against the proposed draft ,” Willkie responded, “I would rather 
not win the election than do that.” Th e draft became law on September 16 and, with 
Willkie’s stance and the appointment of Stimson and Knox to the cabinet, the issue of 
isolationism was neutralized until late in the campaign. 
Just before the election, polls showed that a majority of prospective voters preferred 
Willkie unless war was coming, in which case they wanted Roosevelt’s steady hand. 
On Election Day, they chose the steady hand, and FDR won a third term. 
Only a month after the election, Roosevelt received an urgent message from 
Churchill spelling out just how desperate things were for Britain and making clear that 
“the moment approaches when we shall no longer be able to pay cash for shipping and 
other supplies.” In a fi reside chat just aft er Christmas in 1940, Roosevelt said, “If Great 
Britain goes down…all the Americas, would be living at the point of a gun.” Th e only 
alternative, he told his radio audience, “We must be the great arsenal of democracy .” 
A week later, FDR proposed Lend-Lease legislation which would “loan” war materials 
to the British for the duration of the war. Th e president insisted, “We cannot, and we 
will not, tell them that they must surrender, merely because of present inability to pay 
for the weapons which we know they must have.” 
In the same speech, Roosevelt also described larger purposes for American action 
which was, he said, to secure four freedoms : 
Th e fi rst is freedom of speech and expression.… 
Th e second is freedom of every person to worship God in his own way.… 
Th e third is freedom from want.… 
Th e fourth is freedom from fear.… 
Roosevelt’s “four freedoms” were very popular. Lend-Lease was much less popular. 
Isolationists like Montana Senator Burton Wheeler said that the plan “will plough under 
every fourth American boy.” Newspapers like the Chicago Tribune , the New York Daily 
News , and the Washington Times-Herald all editorialized against the plan. Nevertheless, the 
Congress that had passed so many neutrality acts in the 1930s approved the Lend-Lease 
Act by a 60 to 31 vote in the Senate and a 317 to 71 vote in the House. Britain would get the 
aid that Churchill wanted. 
Th e military preparation in 1940 and 1941 ended the Great Depression. Spending 
$7 billion on Lend-Lease eff orts and an additional $13.7 billion on the expansion of the 
U.S. military (up from $2.2 billion in 1940) provided a huge stimulus to the economy, far 
larger than any stimulus tried during the New Deal. Nearly a million young men were 
draft ed by early 1941, and new jobs opened everywhere, virtually ending unemployment. 
New or redesigned federal agencies brought business leaders into the government 
to manage the huge conversion to a war-oriented economy (see Figure 23-1 ).

While the United States geared up to serve as the “arsenal of democracy,” Hitler 
suddenly attacked his erstwhile ally Russia in June 1941. While there was no love 
lost in the United States for Communist Russia, most Americans knew that if the 
Nazis defeated Russia it would mean disaster. Missouri Senator Harry S. Truman 
said he would not mind it if both sides lost, but he also said, “I don’t want to see 
Hitler victorious under any circumstances.” Th e United States extended Lend-Lease 
aid to the Russians. 
Lend-Lease aid to Britain brought the United States close to war with Germany. 
German U-boats sank ships carrying goods to Britain at fi ve times the rate that new 
ships could be built. Th e United States began patrolling the western Atlantic, guarding 
ships as far as Greenland before turning them over to the British Navy for escort 
to Britain. 
In August, Roosevelt and Churchill met in Newfoundland, planned ways to work 
together, and issued the Atlantic Charter that included a somewhat vague commitment 
to national self-determination for other countries, nonaggression, and “the establishment 
of a wider and permanent system of general security”—planting the seeds of what 
became the United Nations. Meanwhile, patrolling U.S. Navy ships ran into confl ict with 
German submarines. In October 1941, a U-boat attacked the U.S. destroyer Kearny , 
killing 11 sailors, the fi rst U.S. casualties of the war. Roosevelt said, “America has been 
attacked.” Later that month, a submarine sank the USS Reuben James , killing 115 sailors. 
War did not seem far off . 
Growing Tensions with Japan 
While the United States focused on Europe, tensions were also building in the Pacifi c. 
Th e United States wanted to avoid a “two-ocean war,” and sought peace with Japan. 
However, a combination of stubborn—if inadequate— support for China and a lack 
of careful attention did not make for an eff ective foreign policy. Th e Roosevelt administration 
provided modest Lend-Lease support for Chiang Kai-shek’s government and 
allowed individual U.S. pilots to join the Flying Tigers, a volunteer air corps organized 
by Colonel Claire Chennault to fi ght for China, but continued to allow the metal and oil 
exports on which Japan depended.

A new generation of younger Japanese leaders, especially the war minister Hideki 
Tojo, wanted to ensure national glory and signed a formal alliance with Nazi Germany 
and Fascist Italy. Nazi puppet governments in France and Holland gave Japan badly 
needed access to rice, rubber, and most important, oil from Dutch and French colonies 
in Asia. Japan launched the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere to free Asia 
from the colonial powers and to consolidate Japanese control. When Japan landed 
troops in French Indochina in July 1940, the United States fi nally cut off metal and 
aviation gasoline shipments, but not oil, which they saw as the last bargaining chip. As 
1941 began, Japan sent a new ambassador to the United States, Kichisaburo Nomura. 
Nomura and U.S. Secretary of State Cordell Hull sought a way to reduce hostilities but 
failed. By midsummer, hard liners in Japan had won the support of Emperor Hirohito. 
In October, Tojo replaced the moderate Fumimaro Konoye as Prime Minister 
of Japan. Th e new government was determined to go to war. Th e United States had 
broken the secret Japanese code and knew that war was coming. But they did not 
know where—perhaps an attack on American bases in the Philippines or on the 
British colonies in Asia, both of which were warned to prepare for attack. In fact, the 
Japanese military sent a huge fl eet 4,000 miles across the Pacifi c to attack the United 
States itself at Pearl Harbor. 
Japanese Admiral Takijiro Onishi warned that a direct attack on U.S. soil would 
make the Americans “insanely mad.” He said that while Japan would have the advantage 
in a short war, in a longer war, the U.S. industrial capacity and it large supply of 
oil—the fuel of modern war—meant that Japan would have a very hard time of it. But 
Japan’s leaders were confi dent of a quick victory. 
When Japan did attack on December 7, the location was a greater surprise than 
the fact of the attack itself. But Japan’s attack on Hawaii solidifi ed American public 
opinion. Even the staunchest opponents of preparedness, including Charles Lindbergh, 
now supported going to war. 
Quick Review How did the United States move from an isolationist stance to one 
supporting the war effort? How did the attitudes of the government and the people differ? 
MASS MOBILIZATION IN A SOCIETY AT WAR 
Analyze the war’s impact on widely diverse groups of Americans who fought, supported 
the war effort at home, or otherwise lived through the war years. 
For the people of the United States, the attack of December 7, 1941, changed everything. 
Before the war ended in 1945, 16 million Americans served in the armed forces, 
and 405,399 died in combat. All Americans had their lives changed by the war. At the 
beginning of the war, half of white Americans and 90 percent of black Americans lived 
in poverty. Th e war provided a job for everyone, and wartime jobs vastly expanded the 
size of the nation’s middle class. Americans moved around a lot during the war. Th e 
military brought rural and urban Americans together in units that faced the same fears 
and hopes. Far less oft en, it brought people of diff erent races together since the military 
of World War II remained segregated not only by race but also by gender. As the 
war progressed, the Great Depression became a distant memory. New prosperity and 
new knowledge, but also the terrible losses of a major war and new fear about distant 
parts of the world became central to people’s lives. 
Early Battles, Early Losses, 1941–1942 
In the spring of 1941, a secret conversation in Washington between British and 
American offi cials (known by the code name ABC-1 or American-British Conversation 
Number 1) resulted in an agreement that, in the event of a two-front war, which 
everyone hoped to avoid, the United States would focus first on joining Britain to

defeat Germany. As U.S. Army Chief George C. Marshall explained, “Collapse in the 
Atlantic would be fatal; collapse in the Far East would be serious but not fatal.” 
Within hours of the December 7 attack on Pearl Harbor, Japan also attacked U.S. 
bases in the Philippine Islands, the Aleutian Islands off Alaska, as well as Guam and 
Wake Islands in the mid-Pacifi c. Within days, Japanese pilots and troops were in the 
British colonies of Malaysia and Burma, French Indochina, the Dutch East Indies, and 
independent Th ailand. To some, the Japanese were liberators, freeing them from the 
hated European and American colonial authorities. Th e Japanese had been preparing 
well and were a superb fi ghting force. British Hong Kong and American Guam and 
Wake Islands surrendered within a week. In February 1942, Singapore surrendered 
to the Japanese with 85,000 crack British troops now prisoners of war. American and 
British Navy forces lost the battle of Java Sea and the Dutch East Indies, and their rich 
oil fi elds fell to Japan. 
In April and May of 1942, aft er holding out for months against impossible odds, 
the last U.S. troops on the islands of Bataan and Corregidor in the Philippines surrendered. 
Ben Steele, a young rancher from Montana who had volunteered for service, 
remembered that during the 99-day defense of Bataan, the Americans constantly faced 
starvation. Aft er news spread that the commander in the Philippines, General Douglas 
MacArthur, had left for Australia, Steele and the others knew that “Only two things can 
happen to us now, we’re going to be dead or we’re going to be prisoners of war.” 
Aft er surrendering, the American and Filipino troops from Bataan were forced to 
march 66 miles to a railroad junction where they were transported to prison camps. 
Th e march came to be known as the Bataan Death March. Th e Japanese captors, overwhelmed 
by the numbers, had been taught to hate American devils. If a prisoner fell, 
he was kicked, and if he did not move, killed with a bayonet. If prisoners, desperately 
thirsty in the hot sun, moved off the line to get water, they were shot. The surviving 
defenders of Bataan and Corregidor spent more than 3 years as Japanese prisoners. 
By the middle of 1942, Japan controlled the western Pacifi c from the far north to 
Australia, which remained in British hands. 
Th ree days aft er the United States declared war on Japan, Hitler and Mussolini 
declared war on the United States. It was an odd move on their part. Germany, Italy, 
and Japan were allies—based on treaties they had signed with each other in 1936 and 
1937—but if Germany and Italy had held back in declaring war on the United States, 
FDR would have been under great pressure to focus the war only on Japan, leaving 
Britain still isolated. German and Italian declarations of war allowed FDR to keep the 
focus on the Atlantic, which he believed was essential. Th e three nations at war with 
the United States—Germany, Italy, and Japan—were known as the Axis as opposed to 
the allied forces of the United States, Great Britain, and the Soviet Union, joined by 
exiled French troops who called themselves the Free French and forces from China 
and a number of other nations that allied with them. 
Even though the primary American focus was on Europe, U.S. and British forces 
won a partial victory in the Pacifi c in the Battle of the Coral Sea in May 1942 when 
they stopped a Japanese advance to Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea. Th en in June 
1942, the Japanese attacked U.S. forces on Midway Island. But U.S. intelligence 
offi cers broke the Japanese code and knew that the attack was coming. In addition, 
U.S. pilots were learning new maneuvers that allowed direct attacks on Japanese 
ships. Th e Japanese force that was supposed to take the island lost four of its six aircraft 
carriers and all of its planes and pilots. U.S. forces also captured a Japanese Zero 
airplane, then the most modern in the war, and used it to build the U.S. Navy’s new 
Hellcat plane, which could out-maneuver the Zero. Th e Hellcats began arriving in the 
Pacifi c in 1943. 
Despite the successes, winning the war in 1942 was far from a sure thing. 
Germany and Japan both had very strong hands. German submarine commander 
Karl Donitz began sinking coastal shipping vessels in January 1942. New York 

Chapter 23 Living in a World at War 699 
23.3

and other coastal cities refused to turn their lights off , and the submarines used 
the bright city lights to target shipping. In 3 months, the Germans sunk 216 ships, 
half of them tankers with essential oil for Britain. Burned out ships littered the 
American beaches. 
In the summer of 1942, German forces were besieging the Soviet Union while 
their planes bombed Britain. The German submarine fleet shifted from the U.S. 
coast to Atlantic convoys, hitting them especially hard in midocean where little 
help was possible. In July 1942, a convoy of 34 Allied ships headed for the Russian 
ports of Murmansk and Archangel was attacked in the Norwegian Sea, and 23 of the 
34 ships were sunk. German Admiral Donitz was confi dent—and the Americans, 
British, and Russians fearful—that the Allied forces simply could not continue in the 
face of such losses. 
Japan controlled the whole of the western Pacifi c (see Map 23-2 ). In August 1942, 
U.S. forces invaded the tactically important island of Guadalcanal in the Solomon 
Islands and renamed its airfield Henderson Field. A counter invasion from Japan 
came close to success. Th e reporter John Hersey, staying with the troops on the island, 
told readers: 
Th e uniforms, the bravado, the air of wearing a knife in the teeth—these were 
just camoufl age. Th e truth was all over their faces. Th ese were just American 
boys. Th ey did not want that valley or any part of its jungle. Th ey were ex-grocery 
clerks, ex-highway laborers, ex-bank clerks, ex-schoolboys.…[T]hey had joined 
the Marines to see the world, or to get away from a guilt, or most likely to escape 
the draft , not knowingly to kill or be killed. 
But there they were. With navy support, the Marines on Guadalcanal held their position. 
Th e Japanese forces were beaten back until, in February 1943, in a move they 
seldom made during the war, the Japanese abandoned Guadalcanal. 
Men in the Military—Volunteers and Draftees 
As the war began, young men quickly found themselves in uniform. Sixteen million 
men had registered for the draft when the war began, more soon after, and others 
volunteered in anticipation of an expanding draft . Th e draft was administered by the 
Selective Service System through 6,443 local draft boards that decided who was eligible 
for various deferments—for married men, for those with children, for those in 
crucial war work—that were granted less and less oft en. 
Lloyd Kilmer began life on a dairy farm but was working as a bellhop at a hotel 
in Rochester, Minnesota, when he heard the news of Pearl Harbor. Six months later, 
Kilmer enlisted in the Army Air Corps and fl ew combat missions over Europe until he 
was shot down in June 1944. U.S. troops liberated his prisoner of war camp in April 
1945. Growing up in the immigrant neighborhood of East Boston, Massachusetts, 
during the Depression, Al Fossett ascribed his success on the high school track team 
to pretending that he was running aft er something to eat. When war came, he was stationed 
in British India where he served as a gunner on planes that fl ew supplies from 
India to beleaguered Chinese forces. Woodrow W. Crockett was born in Texarkana, 
Arkansas, and joined the army as a private in 1940. In 1942, he was assigned to the 
Tuskegee airmen, an African-American unit that achieved considerable distinction in 
World War II. He flew 149 combat missions during the U.S. invasion of Italy and 
received the Distinguished Flying Cross. 
Most of those who served were white males like Kilmer and Fossett. Th e Great 
Depression shaped their childhood, and they liked the food and security of the army 
even when they were frightened. Only a minority were enthusiastic about serving 
while most were willing to do a job they believed needed to be done. In the process, 
they met a greater diversity of people than any previous generation of Americans and 
saw more of the world and its people.

Deferments, Alternative Service, and War Work 
Not everyone served in the military. Th e Selective Service allowed local draft boards 
considerable discretion. Throughout most of the South, draft boards, which were 
nearly all white, showed a deep aversion to putting black men in uniform and giving 
them guns, with the result that they had to dip much deeper into the pool of white 
men, off ering whites few deferments. Congress allowed young men to complete college 
so that, as one draft board member reported, “fathers in their middle thirties 
were being inducted from their stores, garages, and other businesses,” while they 
saw younger single men sitting in classrooms. A November 1942 law, the Tydings 
Amendment, exempted agricultural workers from the draft . Men in key war industries 
and some who would not fi ght for religious reasons were also sometimes exempted. 
Other Americans found themselves in new jobs they had never before imagined. 
Charles Briscoe’s family left the Dust Bowl for California where he learned sheet metal 
work. In 1940, he took a job at Boeing Aircraft in Wichita, Kansas, building the supersecret 
B-29 long range bomber. Briscoe remembered, “We knew the B-017s and B-24s 
didn’t have the range to get to Japan. We had to have the B-29 to win the war and get 
the men home from over there.” At 14, Ed Powers was too young for the military, but

he joined his father—who was too old to serve—in patrolling their hometown to be 
sure that everyone was honoring the blackout to avoid a German bombing. 
Joseph Bullock was among the 43,000 conscientious objectors who in the words 
of Selective Service regulations “by reason of religious training and belief, is conscientiously 
opposed to participation in war in any form.” Th e largest number of COs, as 
they were called, some 25,000 served as noncombatants in the military, providing fi rst 
aid to troops under extraordinarily dangerous conditions or behind-the-lines logistical 
support. Th ose who for religious reasons could not support the war eff ort in any 
form were allowed to work in civilian public service. Bullock and the 12,000 CPS men 
worked on forestry projects planting trees and building roads, or staffi ng mental hospitals. 
Th ey received no pay, had to cover their own expenses, and did not receive 
veteran benefi ts at the end of the war. A fi nal group of some 6,000 refused out of conscience 
to have anything to do with the Selective Service System, and these men were 
sent to federal prison. Some of them, like David Dellinger, became lifelong antiwar 
activists. In some areas, COs were treated with respect; in others, they met deep hostility. 
Harry Van Dyck remembered being told, “You goddamn COs should all be shot.” 
Aft er the war, Bullock was told that he could not teach Sunday School because his 
wartime service made him an inappropriate role model for Christian children. 
When 40 percent of the 21-year-olds who signed up for the fi rst draft registration 
in late 1940 then got married, General Hershey announced that he would consider 
that recent marriages “might have been for the purpose of evading the draft .” When 
the draft was expanded to include married men, most fathers were still exempted, 
leading one young couple to name their new child “Weatherstrip” because he kept his 
father out of the draft . However, as the need grew, fathers were also draft ed, and by 
1945, nearly a million fathers were in the service. 
Women in Military Service 
Early in the war there was some talk of conscripting women, if not for the military then 
for wartime industrial work. In the end, however, the United States, unlike Great Britain or 
the Soviet Union, left it up to individual women to decide whether they wanted to serve. 
Each of the branches of the military enlisted women in special noncombat units 
that freed men for combat: the U.S. Army established the Women’s Auxiliary Army 
Corps, or WAACs (later the Auxiliary was dropped, and they became the WACs); the 
Young women begin their service as WACs during World War II.

U.S. Navy created the Women Accepted for Voluntary Emergency Service, or WAVES; 
the Army Air Corps set up the Women’s Auxiliary Service Pilots, or WASPS; the Coast 
Guard launched the Women’s Reserve of the Coast Guard, nicknamed the SPARS; and 
the Marines organized an unnamed women’s branch. Some 350,000 women (compared 
with over 15 million men) served in uniform during World War II. Claudine 
“Scottie” Scott remembered her freshman year at the University of Kansas in the fall 
of 1940 as “a fun and exciting time,” but by the following year, the world had become 
a much more serious place. Scott volunteered for the WAVES and was assigned to 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff to deliver the “log of fi ghting going on all over the world” to 
the White House every day. She was at the White House and saw President Roosevelt 
on the day of the allied invasion of Europe in 1944, but her focus was on the fate of her 
boyfriend who was part of the invading force. He was wounded but returned home, 
and they were married in the Veterans Hospital in Richmond, Virginia. 
Martha Settle grew up in Norristown, Pennsylvania. As an African-American, she 
experienced racism within the War Manpower Commission. She applied, and was 
selected by Mary McLeod Bethune, for one of the few offi cer slots allowed to African- 
American WACs. Margaret Ray grew up in Indiana and was recruited into a small 
elite unit of WASPs within the Army Air Force that handled domestic military fl ying 
so men could be freed up to fl y overseas. “Here I was, this farm girl,” Ray remembered, 
“and it was so exciting.” Mary Louise Roberts became a nurse with the army. 
She commanded a fi eld operating room for troops during the landings in Casablanca, 
North Africa, in 1943 and on Anzio beach in Italy in 1944. 
Rosie the Riveter and Her Friends 
Just before the attack on Pearl Harbor, 12 million women in the 
United States held jobs—a dramatic increase from the depths of the 
Depression. Middle-class white women tended to be teachers, nurses, 
social workers, or secretaries. In the course of the war, more than 6 million 
more women entered the workforce. Some 2 million women went 
to work in previously all-male defense plants where they sometimes 
made up half of the workforce. Women also constituted a quarter of 
the workers in the converted auto industry that was producing tanks 
and trucks. On the West Coast, 500,000 women worked in the aircraft 
industry and 225,000 in shipbuilding. Th ey made more money than 
most women had ever made. Th ey took on hard jobs that before the 
war people thought only men could handle or from which tradition, 
law, and all-male unions had excluded them. But even during wartime, 
women were oft en relegated to the lower rungs of the industrial order 
while men took on the highest-skilled, highest-paying jobs. Drilling 
rivets was high-skill and high-pay work, and in spite of the “Rosie the 
Riveter” name and public relations posters, far more women worked in 
routine production jobs. 
Women working in industrial plants had to develop a new fashion 
style that provided room for safe movement, including pants, 
which made movement much easier than a skirt, and short hair, which 
was essential around dangerous machinery. In addition, they had 
to develop a tough attitude in the face of catcalls and wolf whistles. 
Delana Jensen made 155-millimeter howitzers for the army. She was 
hired when the plant was still not sure whether women could handle 
the work, but within months, she was training men. It was exacting 
work and “had to be perfect…within 1/1,000th of an inch.” She liked 
the denim coveralls and remembered, “We were living in a special time 
and place. Th ere was an energy in the air and in the people. We were 
wanted and needed and important to the war eff ort.”

In 1995 Kathy O’Grady interviewed her grandmother Katherine 
O’Grady who remembered the war as a time when women wanted to 
work in war-related industries. The pay was much better than in other 
jobs, and being of service to the nation mattered, as did a new found 
sense of freedom. Many, like O’Grady, looked back on their prewar lives 
as a time when they were much more naïve than they were later on. 
In 1939 I lived in East Providence [Rhode Island)…I worked at 
Gibson’s, a soda fountain at the bus stop on Westminster Street. I 
was very busy. Servicemen from all over used to come in. I made 
$15 for a 48-hour week. I bought my own clothes, paid my own 
expenses, car-fare, whatever I wanted, and I’d go to the movies. If 
you had a five dollar bill then you were very wealthy. 
I met my husband while I was working at Gibson’s. He had a 
construction job building an air base up in Newfoundland. When 
Pearl Harbor broke out, he came back home and we got married. 
All the fellows had gone into the service. His brothers were all 
gone. All the men were leaving. My husband had a deferment 
because his job was considered important to the defense, and 
we had a 9-month old son. But he wanted to go so badly that he 
quit the job.…He was shipped out to Okinawa. He was a Seabee 
and worked in the construction battalion which builds bases. 
The Seabees would go ahead of the Marines to make the landing 
and do all that. He went from one island to the other across 
the Pacific.… 
After my husband went into the Seabee’s I quit my job at 
Gibson’s and went to work in a woolen mill, Lister’s, which before 
the war was just a normal routine job. When the war started they 
needed wool very badly so this was considered a service job. In 
other words, it was important. At the mill the government used to 
send out all the Purple Heart soldiers to talk to us and tell us that we 
couldn’t take time off, and pushed all this patriotism on us.’’.…I think 
I got $27 a week, so it did pay more. The soldiers needed woolen 
blankets. At the time all servicemen were issued their clothing, their 
blanket, their bedroll, the whole bit. The blankets that came home 
after war had traveled all over the world.…We were very proud of 
[our work], because it meant that we were doing our part.… 
After the war things changed because women found out they 
could go out and they could survive. They could really do it on 
their own. That’s where I think women’s lib really started.

Marginalization in a Democracy—The March on Washington and 
the War at Home 
In 1940, African-Americans and Latinos continued to be excluded from the new 
prosperity. Three out of four African-Americans still lived in the rural South, the 
majority still sharecroppers. Most Latinos lived in poverty in the urban or rural 
Southwest. Even those who had moved from farms to small towns or cities saw 
themselves passed over as wartime production picked up. 
In 1940 the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, perhaps the most powerful 
black-led organization in the United States, asked the government to avoid discrimination 
in the expanding armed forces. Aft er A. Philip Randolph, long-time president 
of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, and Walter White, the executive secretary 
of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), met 
with President Roosevelt later that year, they believed they had a friend in the federal 
government, especially given Eleanor Roosevelt’s commitment to civil rights. 
Th e rapidly expanding war industries were less friendly. When the president of 
North American Aviation announced, “We will not employ Negroes,” he spoke for 
many whites in management and on the shop fl oors of the companies. Th en in late 
1940, the War Department announced its policy “not to intermingle colored and white 
enlisted personnel in the same regimental organization.” Randolph felt betrayed, and 
he meant to do something about it.

Randolph proposed a massive march on Washington, initially thinking that 
10,000 blacks would come to Washington, DC, to demand that the government protect 
their economic rights. As word spread, Randolph raised the number to 50,000 and 
then to 100,000. He insisted that this event would be an all-black march. “Th ere are 
some things Negroes must do alone,” he said. Th e march was called for July 1, 1941. 
As it became clear that the march might be a powerful and embarrassing event, 
many people within the administration began to panic. Th ey challenged Randolph’s 
patriotism—How could he do such a thing with war imminent? What will they think 
in Berlin? Randolph’s response was, “Oh, perhaps no more than they already think 
of America’s racial policy.” Friends within the administration tried to persuade 
Randolph to postpone the march, but he persisted. Th e only grounds on which the 
march could be called off , he said, would be a government order “with teeth in it” that 
would truly protect the economic rights of African-Americans in the new industries. 
Randolph won. 
On June 25, 1941, Roosevelt signed Executive Order 8802 “to provide for 
the full and equitable participation of all workers in defense industries, without 
discrimination because of race, creed, color, or national origin.” Th e order created the 
Fair Employment Practices Committee (later Commission) to enforce the policy. It 
was the order “with teeth in it.” Th e march was called off . Some called Executive Order 
8802 an economic Emancipation Proclamation. Executive Order 8802 was enforced 
unevenly but suffi ciently enough to make a real diff erence. Sybil Lewis was a maid in 
Oklahoma being paid $3.50 a week before the war. She was hired at Lockheed Aircraft 
in Los Angeles at $48 per week. She was paired with a white woman from Arkansas, 
and though they certainly had their diff erences, Lewis remembered that they learned, 
“to relate to each other in ways that we never experienced before.” Not all encounters 
were as positive. 
White workers went on strike at a Western Electric factory in Baltimore, Maryland, 
demanding segregated restrooms. In a factory in Mobile, Alabama, shipyard workers 
rioted over the promotion of a black welder. Riots also took place in Detroit and New 
York City in 1943. Twenty-fi ve blacks and nine whites were killed in a June riot in 
Detroit, and six blacks were killed in another riot in New York’s Harlem. As news of 
these clashes spread, army bases around the world also exploded as segregated white 
and black units clashed in England and in the United States. 
Latinos also faced exclusion and violence. Th e most obvious symbol of Mexican 
American resistance to white culture were gangs known as pachucos , or zoot suiters, 
for the exaggerated clothing— a long suit coat with baggy pants that came in at 
the ankles—that symbolized their defi ance of social norms. During wartime frugality 
when most people were channeling money and resources toward the war eff ort, the 
zoot suits also seemed an unpatriotic extravagance. In June 1943, white servicemen in 
various boot camps in the Los Angeles area took out much of their own frustration by 
attacking the nearby Latino population, especially the zoot suiters. Police, for the most 
part, looked the other way. Th e zoot suit riots spread elsewhere until FDR intervened 
to stop the violence, mostly because he had been courting Mexico as a wartime ally. 
In spite of riots and discrimination, and they were very real, World War II also 
gave African-Americans, Latinos, and American Indians new opportunities. Because 
of the wartime labor shortages and federal enforcement eff orts, many who had previously 
been excluded got jobs in industries previously closed to them. Others became 
more politically active, and more would do so once the war ended. 
Japanese Internment 
In an era when many Americans sacrifi ced much, including their lives, other Americans, 
especially Japanese Americans, saw their most basic freedoms undermined by wartime 
hysteria. Th e immigration legislation of 1924 had prohibited immigration from Japan. 
As a result, the Japanese population in the mainland United States comprised some

120,000 people of Japanese descent split between 
some 40,000 Issei , or first-generation immigrants 
who had arrived before 1924 and were by law 
“aliens ineligible for citizenship,” and twice as many 
younger Nisei , or American-born Japanese who 
were American citizens. A majority of the Issei were 
over the age of 50 by 1941, while many Nisei were 
under 18 and largely quite Americanized. Th e small 
Japanese Issei and Nisei community had remained 
relatively isolated. Most supported themselves by 
small truck farms or nurseries providing fruits, vegetables, 
and garden supplies all along the Pacifi c coast. 
In the immediate aft ermath of the Pearl Harbor 
attack, there was little overt hostility toward 
Japanese Americans. Th e usually conservative Los 
Angeles Times editorialized that the Japanese were 
“good Americans, born and educated as such.” 
Speaking of the Nisei, General John L. DeWitt, 
head of the U.S. Army on the West Coast said, “An 
American citizen, aft er all, is an American citizen.” 
In addition, U.S. Attorney General Francis Biddle 
wrote that he was determined “to avoid mass 
internment and the persecution of aliens that had 
characterized the First World War.” All would 
quickly change their minds. 
While there were 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry living on the U.S. mainland 
in 1941, there were 200,000 Japanese living in Hawaii, almost half of the population of 
the islands. Aft er the attack on Pearl Harbor, the federal government declared a state 
of martial law and suspended basic rights in Hawaii. Several hundred Japanese were 
arrested as suspected spies and saboteurs. But the entire economy of Hawaii would 
have collapsed if the Japanese community had been interned, and there would have 
been no place to put them and no one to guard them. 
Th e situation for the Japanese on the West Coast was very diff erent. Th eir treatment 
dramatically contrasted not only the situation in Hawaii but also the way that 
German and Italian communities in the United States were treated. Unlike during 
World War I, the German and Italian communities were not subjected to mass discrimination 
during World War II. There were arrests of individuals suspected of 
activities supporting the country’s enemies, and given the strength of the Nazi movement 
within the United States prior to the war, there were individuals that the government 
had reason to watch. All noncitizens from Germany and Italy were labeled 
“enemy aliens” when the war began, but FDR ordered the Attorney General to cancel 
the designation in the fall of 1942—just before Election Day. 
When some accused Japanese Americans of spying, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover 
said that such charges were utterly without foundation. Nevertheless, leaders of the 
California Grower-Shipper Vegetable Association, representing large-scale agriculture, 
did not like the competition of the small Japanese American truck farms, and one 
association leader declared, “We might as well be honest.…It’s a question of whether 
the white man lives on the Pacifi c Coast or the brown man.” Respected journalists, 
including Walter Lippmann and Westbrook Pegler, pushed for removal. Pegler wrote, 
“Th e Japanese in California should be under armed guard to the last man and woman 
right now, and to hell with habeas corpus until the danger is over.” And by early 1942, 
General DeWitt, who had fi rst said “An American citizen is an American citizen,” 
was saying “Th e Japanese race is an enemy race and…the racial strains are undiluted.” 
A few, very few, white voices, like the tiny Committee on American Principles and 
Fair Play, defended the rights of Japanese Americans. With public opinion running 
While some Latinos faced hostile rioters in places like Los Angeles, others, like these Mexican- 
American soldiers, served in the U.S. military and believed that the war was the beginning of 
their successful civil rights movement.

so strongly in favor of removal, President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066 on 
February 19, 1942, ordering the War Department to create “military areas…from 
which any and all persons may be excluded.” Th e order did not specify which areas 
or which persons were to be excluded, but the result was that people of Japanese 
ancestry were ordered out of most of the three West Coast states. 
Initially, Japanese Issei and Nisei in America were allowed to move to the Midwest 
or the East. Th e rest of the country, like Hawaii, was not covered by the internment 
order. Some 15,000 people voluntarily moved before General DeWitt ordered an end 
to such moves in late March. Aft er that, people of Japanese ancestry were ordered 
to report to “assembly centers,” including the Santa Anita racetrack in Southern 
California and the Tanforan Racetrack in San Bruno near San Francisco. 
Yamato Ichihashi, a Stanford professor, described Santa Anita as “mentally and 
morally depressive.” Families who had lived in their own homes, managed their own 
businesses, in some cases like Ichihashi had been involved in rich professional lives, 
were suddenly in armed camps, living in stables that had recently held horses, and 
kept behind barbed wire under the watch of armed guards. Th e instructions were to 
bring only what they could carry—no pets and no cameras. 
Forced out of their homes and into the temporary relocation centers, some 100,000 
Issei and Nisei were then moved a second time to 10 relocation camps scattered 
through sparsely inhabited regions of the West. Th e fi rst to open was at Manzanar 
on a dried up lake bed between the coastal mountains and the higher Sierra Nevada 
range. In this desert location, summer temperatures were oft en above 100 degrees 
while the winter was freezing. Each family had a 20 by 20 foot uninsulated cabin. 
For most of the internees, the next 3 years were a time of enforced idleness while 
the rest of the country worked harder than ever. Some young men volunteered to 
join the all-Japanese units fi ghting in Europe and served with distinction while their 
families waited for them in the camps. Other young men, off ended at being asked to 
foreswear allegiance to an emperor they had never cared about, refused any form of 
service and were held as virtual prisoners at Tule Lake, California. 
Some of the Japanese community challenged the process of internment. Gordon 
Hirabayashi remembered hearing of the order to report to the camps and thinking, 
“I was confronted with a dilemma: Do I stay out of trouble and succumb to the status of 
second-class citizen, or do I continue to live like other Americans and thus disobey the 
law?” He disobeyed the law and challenged it in court. In its fi rst ruling on the legality 
of internment, the U.S. Supreme Court threw out Hirabayashi’s challenge and he served

time in a prison camp. Although Justice Frank Murphy supported the court’s unanimous 
opinion in the case, he used the occasion to write that the Japanese internment was the 
fi rst time in history that the federal government had “sustained a substantial restriction 
on the personal liberty of citizens of the United States based upon the accident of race or 
ancestry,” while noting the parallels with what Nazi Germany was doing to Jews. 
A second set of cases known as Korematsu v. United States then began to move 
through the courts. In late 1944, aft er the presidential election and as Korematsu v. 
United States was about to be decided, the War Department declared that the original 
“military necessity” was now over and that those of Japanese ancestry were free to 
return to their homes. When the court announced its decision, it again sidestepped 
the specifi c issue, but as Hugo Black wrote in the majority decision, “All legal restrictions 
which curtail the civil rights of a single racial group are immediately suspect.” 
As those who had lived in the camps returned to the West Coast, they found that 
their homes and businesses were long gone and that they had been excluded from 
the prosperity of wartime America. While the losses of those interned were estimated 
at $400 million, Congress provided $37 million in reparations in 1948. Only decades 
later, Congress voted $20,000 for each surviving internee, and in 1998, President Bill 
Clinton awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Fred Korematsu.

A month aft er the United States entered the war, Roosevelt told Congress, “It will 
not be suffi cient for us…to produce a slightly superior supply of munitions to that 
of Germany, Japan, and Italy.” Th e president said the United States needed to provide 
“crushing superiority of equipment in any theater of the world war.” Roosevelt 
insisted that the United States produce 60,000 airplanes in 1942 and 125,000 more in 
1943, plus 120,000 tanks, 55,000 antiaircraft guns, and 16 million tons of merchant 
shipping. Few thought it could be done, but the goals were met. 
Wartime Production 
Several factors led to the extraordinary U.S. output in the machinery of war in 1942 
and 1943. Compared to the rest of the world, the United States was a manufacturing 
giant even in the 1930s, and the United States had huge supplies of iron ore, coal, and 
oil. In 1937, the United States produced 4.8 million automobiles while Germany produced 
331,000 and Japan only 26,000. Moreover at that point in 1937, perhaps half of 
all U.S. manufacturing plants were idle and a very large part of the U.S. labor force was 
out of work. It would not take long, once the country put itself on a war footing, for 
the unemployed to go to work, the plants to start up, and those already in operation to 
shift from peace-time to war-focused production. Th e War Production Board, the government 
agency charged with ensuring that the country produced the war materials 
needed, quickly prohibited the manufacture of automobiles for private use and limited 
other civilian manufacturing aft er the nation went to war. On February 10, 1942, auto 
workers in Detroit held a little ceremony for the last cars coming down the line then 
began rebuilding the machinery to make tanks and trucks. Aircraft plants, especially 
the giant Boeing and Lockheed plants on the West Coast, and Ford’s Willow Run aircraft 
plant near Detroit started to turn out planes. Shipyards went to three shift s. 
Th e United States also had an attitude toward manufacturing that greatly helped 
its success. German armaments minister Albert Speer told Hitler that he was worried 
because it was the Americans, not the Germans, who “knew how to act with organizationally 
simple methods and therefore achieved great results” while Germany was 
stuck with an “outmoded, tradition-bound, and arthritic organizational system.” At 
the beginning of the war, Germany made 425 diff erent kinds of aircraft , 151 kinds 
of trucks, and 150 different motorcycles all to exacting precision standards. The 
Americans made far fewer models, accepted lower standards, and got things done—a 
high-volume output that far surpassed allies or enemies. 
Perhaps the best example of American industrial productivity was the Liberty ship, 
the workhorse of the merchant marine that kept Britain, Russia, and later U.S. forces 
in the Pacifi c supplied throughout the war. Th e Liberty ships were all built to the same 
standard: 440 feet long with a cargo hold that could contain 330 freight cars, 440 tanks, 
or 3.4 million C-rations. When the fi rst Liberty ship, the Patrick Henry, was christened 
on December 30, 1941, just after the Pearl Harbor attack, it had taken 355 days— 
just shy of a year—to build. Six months later, in June 1942, it took 105 days to build 
a Liberty ship, and in November 1942, working around the clock, workers built the 
Robert E. Peary in less than 5 days. One engineer called the Liberty ships the “Model T 
of the seas,” and President Roosevelt called them ugly ducklings, but they did the job. 
Henry Kaiser created a huge new industrial facility in Richmond, on San Francisco 
Bay, where tens of thousands of workers of different races and from every part of 
the country, many of whom had never worked in any industry before, built these 
ships. Th e highly specifi c jobs of mass-produced ship building in which each worker 
repeated one small task over and over again took much less skill than had the jobs of 
elite shipbuilding workers in the past, but new workers loved the opportunities the 
yards provided, and the fi nished ships just kept coming. 
Th e huge increase in American industrial activity was not without its problems. 
Early in 1942, the government took several steps to control infl ation and costs. Th e 
Offi ce of Price Administration announced a General Maximum Price Regulation in 

Chapter 23 Living in a World at War 709 
23.2 
23.4 
April that made the prices of goods and services in March 1942 permanent. Known as 
“General Max,” the regulation did help control costs and infl ation. Th e National War 
Labor Board negotiated a settlement between union and management at Bethlehem, 
Republic, Youngstown, and Inland Steel Companies that limited wage increases to 
cost of living. Known as the “Little Steel agreement” (the U.S. Steel Company was 
“Big Steel”), the agreement became a norm throughout American industries. Although 
there had been several strikes in the months just before the war, most of organized 
labor took a “no strike pledge” for the duration of the war in return for a government 
policy that required industries to maintain labor contracts and union membership. 
Wartime Prosperity 
In spite of restrictions on wage increases, more Americans were employed and earned 
more money than ever before in their lives or the nation’s history during World War II. 
Wartime rationing limited some goods. People needed ration stamps to purchase their 
monthly allotment of meat, coff ee, tires, and gasoline, and new cars were simply not available. 
Housing was very hard to fi nd, thus, many lived in cramped quarters, while extended 
families oft en moved in together. Nevertheless, Americans who could remember the Great 
Depression found themselves with previously undreamed-of opportunity. Laura Briggs, a 
young farm woman from Idaho, remembered, “We and most other farmers went from a 
tarpaper shack to a new frame house with indoor plumbing…[and] a hot water heater.…It 
was just so modern we couldn’t stand it.” A shipyard worker in Portsmouth, Virginia, said, 
“I felt like something had come down from heaven. I went from forty cents an hour to… 
two seventy-fi ve an hour.…[T]he war completely turned my life around.” By December 
1944, Macy’s department stores reported the highest volume of sales in their history. 
National leaders worried about a combination of prosperity and complacency. 
One Pentagon offi cer said that Americans “have never been bombed.…Th ey have little 
appreciation of the horrors of war.” In December 1943, FDR told his cabinet that 
he sometimes thought, “One of the best things that could happen, would be to have 
a few German bombs fall here to wake us up.” But other than isolated and utterly 
unsuccessful enemy eff orts to fi re on the Oregon coast and New York’s Long Island, 
the continental United States was never bombed or shot at, which was a dramatically 
diff erent experience from that of Britain or Russia or, of course, Italy, Germany, and 
Japan. Letters home from those doing the fi ghting were censored, and even if they had 
not been, many soldiers did not want to discuss the horrors of war. 
Sometimes complacency had a high cost. When two inmates escaped from 
Auschwitz and brought stories of the Holocaust to the United States, many simply 
refused to believe that such things were possible. In the summer of 1943, given detailed 
reports of the Nazi death camps, Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter simply 
responded, “I am unable to believe you.” It was simply too horrible to contemplate. 
Th e degree to which traditional anti-Semitism played a role in some people’s responses 
to the news about Nazi death camps, the degree to which people such as Frankfurter 
simply could not believe what they were hearing, and the extent to which other urgencies 
of the war led people to focus elsewhere has been debated ever since the war. For 
whatever reason—or probably many reasons—few Americans took the stories of the 
emerging Holocaust seriously until the end of the war demonstrated their awful truth. 
Initially, the administration wanted to raise taxes to pay most of the war’s cost 
immediately, but in the end, taxes covered about 45 percent, while loans covered the 
rest. Nevertheless, taxes increased signifi cantly during the war. Th e Revenue Act of 
1942 raised $7 billion in new taxes. In 1939, only 4 million of the richest Americans 
paid income tax. Th e 1942 law brought 13 million new tax payers into the system. 
Th e government also began payroll tax withholding in 1943, requiring employers to 
deduct taxes and pay them directly to the government before issuing paychecks. Th e 
rapid increases in wages and job opportunities, coupled with continued appeals to 
patriotism, limited objections to the new and much higher levels of taxation.

Th e government also borrowed money. Low-cost Series E bonds were sold, allowing 
many Americans to save some of what they were earning and contribute to the 
war eff ort. Larger loans were also forthcoming. Commercial banks increased their 
holdings in U.S. government debt from $1 billion in 1941 to $24 billion in 1945. In 
spite of all the borrowing and spending, the United States emerged from the war as 
the one remaining economic powerhouse in the world as the economies of all the 
other economic leaders suff ered much more from the war. 
Quick Review How was the American experience during World War II different from that 
of people in Europe and Asia? 
WINNING A WORLD WAR—NORTH AFRICA, EUROPE, ASIA, THE 
PACIFIC, 1943–1945 
Explain the course of the war leading to victory in Europe and then the Pacific. 
While many Americans prospered during World War II, for those in the military, 
especially those in combat, World War II was a combination of long waits, boredom, 
and occasional moments of sheer terror, pain, and heroism. 
The War in Europe, 1943–1945 
In late 1942, the Russians insisted that it was time for their western allies to open a 
second front and attack Germany and German-occupied France directly to take the 
pressure off of Russia. But Churchill, remembering the terrible British losses of World 
War I, would not agree. Instead, Britain and America kept bombing Germany, and 
allied troops landed at Oran, Algeria, in November 1942 to attack German forces in 
North Africa, a huge diversion as far as Stalin was concerned, but it was the beginning 
of some victories that lift ed spirits among the Allies. 
In January 1943, Roosevelt went to Casablanca in North Africa to meet with 
Churchill, becoming the fi rst president since Wilson to travel outside of the Western 
Hemisphere and the fi rst since Lincoln to visit U.S. troops in the fi eld. Th ey agreed 
on several things: that they would continue to bomb Germany; that after North 
Africa, they would invade Italy, not the coast of France; and that while the United 
States would continue to supply Britain and Russia, a third of new forces and supplies 
would go to the Pacifi c. At a press conference at the end of the meeting, FDR also said 
that the Allies would accept only unconditional surrender from Germany, Italy, and 
Japan; there would be no intermediate peace negotiations. Th en, in February 1943, the 
Russian Army and the Russian winter defeated the Nazi troops at Stalingrad, and the 
tide of war began to change. Th e Russian Army—known as the Red Army, which had 
been retreating and defending, went on the off ensive. Th e German Wehrmacht— the 
military machine that had been undefeated in Europe since 1939—started retreating. 
In the summer of 1943, American and British units began the attack on what was 
known as “fortress Europe”—the Nazi-controlled territory at the heart of the continent. 
On July 10, 1943, U.S., Canadian, and British forces, having sent coded messages that 
lured the Germans and Italians into defensive positions on the northern part of the Sicily, 
instead landed on the south coast of the island. U.S. forces under General George Patton 
made rapid progress across the island taking Palermo on the north coast on July 22. Th e 
eff ort was bolstered by welcoming crowds who helped them and shouted “Down with 
Mussolini.” Italy’s King Victor Emmanuel III dismissed Mussolini and had him arrested, 
but German units in Italy continued to fi ght. Allied forces continued a long, slow, and 
bitter battle up the Italian peninsula, attacking Salerno in September 1943, sustaining a 
long battle around Monte Cassino, making a fresh landing on the beaches at Anzio outside 
of Rome in January 1944, and fi nally taking control of Rome itself in June 1944.

MAP 23-4 The War in Europe. Early in the war, Nazi forces had attacked France and then the Soviet Union, 
but as the tide of war turned, Soviet forces moved across much of eastern Europe and into Germany itself 
while U.S. and British forces attacked Nazi forces in North Africa, Italy, and fi nally France and Germany.

While the Red Army rolled west from Russia into Poland and eventually Germany, 
and while American and British forces won battles in North Africa and Italy, American 
pilots joined their British counterparts in what became round-the-clock bombing of 
Germany. Th e British had begun bombing German military targets, fi rst in France and 
then, as the planes got better, in the Ruhr Valley of Germany itself. Precision bombing in 
real wartime conditions was exceedingly diffi cult, so the British simply tried to destroy 
the morale of the German civilians, especially industrial workers, by bombing wherever 
they could—what some called terror bombing. When the Americans joined the war, they 
initially found the terror bombing to be abhorrent, but they worked out a compromise: 
the British would bomb at night, bombing wherever they could, and the Americans, with 
more sophisticated equipment, could bomb specifi ed targets during the day. Th e fi rst 
U.S. bombers began their attacks in August 1942, and by January 1943, hundreds of U.S. 
bombers began penetrating German airspace, hitting industrial targets like the German 
city of Bremen. Th e losses of pilots and crews were staggering. Six hundred Americans 
were killed in the summer of 1943, 16 percent of those who fl ew missions. One pilot 
remembered his terror when being attacked by German Messerschmitt 109s: 
Th e plane shook with the chatter of our guns.…As other planes were hit, we 
had to fl y through their debris.…When a plane blew up, we saw their parts all 
over the sky. We smashed into some of the pieces. One plane hit a body which 
tumbled out of a plane ahead. A crewman went out the front hatch of a plane 
and hit the tail assembly of his own plane. No chute. His body turned over and 
over like a bean bag tossed into air. 
And still the crews kept fl ying. 
In November 1943, President Roosevelt left the United States for a second time, fl ying 
to Cairo, Egypt, for a third meeting with Prime Minister Churchill and then on to Teheran, 
Iran, for his first meeting with Stalin, which Churchill and the nominal Chinese leader 
Chiang Kai-shek also attended. FDR was intrigued to meet Stalin in person. At Cairo, FDR 
also tried to persuade Churchill that Britain must renounce its colonies in India, Burma, 
Malaya, and Hong Kong and promise them independence aft er the war as the United States 
was doing with the Philippine Islands. Churchill was a great wartime leader in Britain, but 
he was equally a lifelong British imperialist, and he was not about to be persuaded. 
Th e Teheran Conference included discussions of the war in China. In addition, Stalin 
kept up the pressure for the United States and Britain to invade France as quickly as possible 
and promised to join the war against Japan once the war in Europe was won. Th e 
conference was also a test of the personal chemistry between Stalin and FDR. Although 
the U.S. president was confi dent of his own skill in persuading people, he confessed, “I 
couldn’t get any personal connection with Stalin.” U.S. Ambassador to Russia Averell 
Harriman described Stalin as someone of “high intelligence,” with a “fantastic grasp of 
detail” and “shrewdness.” Stalin, Harriman said, was “better informed than Roosevelt, 
more realistic than Churchill, in some ways the most eff ective of the war leaders. At the 
same time he was, of course, a murderous tyrant.” Stalin wanted an absolute promise 
that the United States and Britain would start the invasion of Germany—code named 
Operation Overlord —in the spring of 1944. And he wanted to make sure that others 
knew, as he had told Josef Tito, who was leading a Communist uprising behind German 
lines in Yugoslavia, “whoever occupies a territory also imposes his own social system.” 
The Red Army, Stalin assured everyone, would not pull back from the lands 
it was seizing from Germany. Operation Overlord was set for May 1, 1944. In the 
meantime, U.S. and British planes kept bombing Germany and Germany-occupied 
France—6,000 bombing runs during 1 week alone in February 1944—to make it 
diffi cult for German forces to prepare for an invasion that they knew was coming. 
Although Roosevelt had become convinced as early as 1942 that the Nazis were killing 
Jews, the planes did not bomb the Nazi death camps or the rail lines to Auschwitz. 
U.S. planners simply could not bring themselves to believe that anything like the scale 
of the Holocaust was happening in spite of the fact that by 1944 they had clear evidence

of the reality. Questions remain about why, with so many bombs being dropped, some 
better eff ort was not made to stop the trains going to those camps. 
Everyone agreed that the Americans would lead the invasion of Western Europe. 
Roosevelt passed over several other army officers and appointed General Dwight 
D. Eisenhower to lead the attack. Born in Texas and raised in Abilene, Kansas, 
Eisenhower, better known as Ike to everyone, had spent his entire career in the peacetime 
army. He had been promoted to the rank of colonel months before the United 
States entered the war in 1941. Ike had a unique ability to get people to work together 
and do so with good cheer, skills that would be needed in the utmost to coordinate the 
American, British, and French forces involved in the invasion of Europe. 
Th e buildup in Britain in 1943 and early 1944 was huge, with 150,000 U.S. soldiers 
arriving every month. Th e British called these American troops “overpaid, oversexed, 
and over here,” but welcomed them not only for what they were about to do for 
the liberation of Europe but also for the supplies of cocoa, canned meat, candy bars, 
tobacco, and even toilet paper that they had. Finally, with the tides right and a break 
predicted in the weather, Eisenhower decided that June 6 was the time to go—and so 
the day became known as D-Day , 1944. 
One young soldier, Elliott Johnson, remembered, “On the morning of June 6, we 
took off . I can remember the morning. Who could sleep?…I was on an LST, a landing 
ship tank.” An armada of 6,483 vessels of all sorts of descriptions made the brief 
seasickness-inducing trip across the English Channel to land on several beaches in 
Normandy, code named Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno, and Sword, under intense German 
shelling and rifl e fi re. Units of the U.S. 82nd and 101st Airborne divisions parachuted 
behind the German lines to break communications between the Germans on the beach 
and their commanders. In the confusion of the invasion most Allied troops were also 
cut off from their commanders and had to make their own decisions. 
Troops landing on Omaha beach on D-Day had to use grappling irons to reach the 
tops of the cliff s facing them, suff ering large losses. Once they got off the beaches and over 
the cliff s, British and U.S. troops got stuck on hedgerows, long lines of tightly planted 
bushes 5 to 10 feet wide that farmers in Normandy had used instead of fences and that 
now provided far better protection for German troops than planners had estimated. 
Slowly the troops broke past the initial defenses. General Omar Bradley refl ected this 
“thin wet line of khaki that dragged itself ashore” held its ground and then started moving 
inland. Johnson remembered the odd scenes of battle, “Now on my way down the road I 
saw, on my right, these dead German boys. On my left , going across the fi eld, is a French 
peasant leading a cow, cradling its head in his arms, protecting it with his body as much as 
possible. He had come back to get his cow, leading it away from all the noise and death.” 
Johnson and the rest kept moving. 
American forces moved quickly to take control of the French towns 
of Brest, Lorient, and St. Nazaire and then moved on to Paris, which 
they liberated on August 25, 1944. A tank force under the command 
of General Patton headed straight for the Rhine River and Germany 
itself. German troops fought hard, but they were outnumbered as more 
troops came across the Channel. By November, the Allied forces were 
at the Rhine River and the border of Germany. 
In December, Hitler ordered one last desperate Blitzkrieg and 
eight German divisions roared out of the Ardennes forest to surround 
American troops in a bulge in the Allied line near the village of Bastogne, 
Belgium. When the Germans called on the surrounded American 
forces to surrender, their commander, General Anthony C. McAuliff e, 
responded with one word, “Nuts!” When the German officer who 
received the message didn’t understand it, a translator explained that it 
meant “Go to Hell!” With the help of tanks ordered north from Paris, 
the Allied forces defeated the Germans in the so-called the Battle of the 
Bulge, and U.S. forces began moving into Germany.

As Americans moved across Germany, they discovered the full reality of 
the Nazi death camps. Russian units liberated the fi rst camps early in 1945, and 
then in April, U.S. forces liberated Buchenwald with 20,000 prisoners. U.S. soldiers 
described the horror of the smell and seeing the bodies stacked up in piles. 
Just before the army arrived, prisoners seized control of Buchenwald, thinking, 
correctly, that the Nazi guards might well try to kill all of them to hide the evidence 
of what had been going on. U.S. forces later liberated Dora-Mittelbau, 
Flossenburg, Dachau, and Mauthausen camps, while British and Soviet forces 
liberated others. In many of the camps, the liberating armies found prisoners 
on the brink of starvation and weakened by disease. Th ey also found piles of 
corpses, human bones, cremation ovens, and ample other evidence of the horrors 
that had actually taken place. Th e Nazis had systematically killed 6 million 
Jews and another 6 million people—gypsies, homosexuals, people with disabilities, 
and others they considered inferior humans. 
Allied troops kept moving east and Red Army troops moved west. While 
armies marched, the bombing of Germany continued, including a controversial 
joint U.S.–British bombing of the city of Dresden, Germany, in February 
1945 in which the resulting firestorm killed perhaps 25,000 people. The 
Russians were soon within miles of Berlin itself. U.S. troops fi nally crossed 
the Rhine River in March and the Elbe River in April while the Russian Army 
attacked Berlin. On April 30, in a Berlin bunker 55 feet underground, with 
Russian troops directly above, Hitler shot himself. A week later, Admiral 
Donitz, who had replaced him, ordered all German units to cease operation. 
Th e war in Europe was over. 
Roosevelt’s Death, Truman’s Leadership 
Just days before the war in Europe ended, on April 12, 1945, President 
Franklin D. Roosevelt died. Roosevelt had led the United States longer than 
any president ever had or ever would. And suddenly, he was gone. In the last year of 
his life, Roosevelt’s health was terrible. His blood pressure was dangerously high, his 
hands shook, and he found it hard to stand even with his leg braces. Few of those closest 
to him were surprised when he died on a short vacation at Warm Springs, Georgia. 
Nevertheless, the news was devastating. Months earlier, in November 1944, Roosevelt 
had been elected to a fourth term in offi ce. Unlike the third term, he made it clear early 
on that he wanted to see the war through to the end. His Republican opponent was the 
reformist young governor of New York State, Th omas E. Dewey, but more Americans 
wanted continuity in a time of war. Roosevelt defeated Dewey by a comfortable margin, 
winning 53 percent of the popular vote and 432 electoral votes to Dewey’s 99. 
The November 1944 election had brought one important change, however. In 
1940, Roosevelt had turned to his trusted confi dent, Agriculture Secretary Henry A. 
Wallace, to serve as vice president. By 1944, though, many in the Democratic Party, 
worried that Roosevelt might not live out the next term, thought Wallace was too liberal, 
and convinced Roosevelt and the nominating convention to fi nd another candidate. 
Th e compromise candidate was Missouri Senator Harry S. Truman. Truman 
had served in the army in World War I, tried unsuccessfully to open a clothing store 
in Kansas City, and then worked his way up in the Democratic political machine of 
his home town. He was elected to the Senate in 1934 and strongly supported the New 
Deal. In his second Senate term, he led a committee looking into war profi teering. He 
had been vice president for less than 3 months, had seldom met with FDR, and did not 
know many of the highest-level government secrets, including the development of the 
atomic bomb, when, on the aft ernoon of April 12, 1945, he stood in the White House 
cabinet room and took the oath of offi ce as president of the United States. It would be 
Truman, not Roosevelt, who would lead the nation in the fi nal months of the war and 
the crucial years aft er it.

The War in the Pacifi c, 1943–1945 
While the war in Europe was over, the war in the Pacifi c was far from over, and U.S. 
troops were preparing for what they knew would be a horrifi c invasion of Japan itself. 
After the successful seizure of control of Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands in 
February 1943, commanders made the decision to skip some Japanese-held islands, 
leaving their troops isolated, and instead, “island hop” toward their main objective. 
U.S. forces moved slowly but surely toward Japan. Th e defeats of 1942 seemed further 
behind. American factories produced machine guns, ships, and airplanes at an 
extraordinary rate, far faster than Japan could match, and enough to supply forces in 
the Pacifi c even as the war in Europe remained the priority until it was won. 
Th e war in the Pacifi c was brutal. American troops came up against Japanese soldiers 
who would fi ght to the very last. Th e Japanese lived by a code that prohibited 
Alvin Kernan went on to a successful academic career at 
Princeton and Yale, but in 1940, he was a 17-year-old looking 
for opportunity. He found it, serving in the Pacific from Pearl 
Harbor to the Japanese surrender. His is a story of furious battles 
and long waits, experiencing fear, bravery, boredom, joy, and most 
of all gratitude for surviving. For many who fought, World War II 
was not a grand campaign against fascism but a battle to keep 
going and survive. 
In the winter of 1940–41, I stood in the deep snows of the 
mountains of southern Wyoming and realized that it wasn’t going 
to work.…Seventeen years old, no job, no prospects, I knew how 
to do only one thing, the same thing all inland mountain boys 
do, go to sea.…Still eager to work with airplanes, I considered it a 
stroke of good luck that I had been assigned to Torpedo Squadron 
6, part of the air group on the USS Enterprise ( CV-6 ), one of three 
carriers in the Pacific Fleet.…I was brought down to earth that 
afternoon by being put on the anchor chain work detail. Life on 
board ship is a constant battle with rust, in which the weapons are 
the chipping hammer, the wire brush, red lead, and gray paint.… 
Hard work, dirty, tiring, hot, and totally unrewarded.… 
[On the morning of December 7, 1941] The captain came on 
the public address system to announce that Pearl Harbor had 
been bombed and that we were now at war with the Japanese. 
I didn’t worry about being killed, but I did wonder how long 
I was going to have to stay in the navy now. We all disliked the 
Japanese and the Germans in a general kind of way, not really 
knowing much about them.…Each sailor was given postcards 
to send home: two with the printed message “I am well and will 
write soon,” and another two with “I am wounded and will write 
details as soon as possible.” We joked that there should be a third 
message, “I am dead.”…Death lived on an aircraft carrier operating 
in wartime conditions.…[A] thoughtless step backward on 
the flight and hanger decks where the planes were turning up 
led to decapitation and gory dismemberment by a propeller. 
Planes went out on patrol and were never heard from again. 
[In October 1942] A little after 0900, the public address system 
broke the quiet of the ship with an announcement from the 
bridge, “Enemy aircraft at fifty miles and closing.” In the ordnance 
shack, just below the flight deck, we could see nothing, only listen, 
feel the vibrating steel deck, and slide back and forth with 
the steep turns that came in quick succession.…As I started back 
across the flight deck, the guns began firing again as a single 
diver-bomber made a run on us. I lay flat on the deck, covering 
as much of my body as possible with my tin hat, trying to work 
my way into it, and thinking for the first time that I was likely to 
die, and resenting it, feeling that at nineteen I really hadn’t had 
a chance to do most of the things people do and vowing to do 
them if I survived. From that moment to this, life has seemed a 
gift—overtime, in a way—and all the more enjoyable for it.… 
August 13 [1945]—they tell us that the war has ended.… 
There was nothing to do to celebrate, and I felt nothing, absolutely 
nothing—no exhilaration, no triumph, no anticipation of 
going home, not even the simple pleasure of having survived.

troops knew that the Americans would always have more food, more armaments, 
and more back-up, but they were confi dent that their loyalty and fi ghting spirit was 
enough to make up for all of that. 
From bombers based on Midway and on Henderson Field on Guadalcanal, from

Japanese civilians and soldiers jumped to their deaths from rocky cliff s rather than surrender. 
In air battles during June, U.S. forces, fl ying new and much better planes, virtually 
decimated the Japanese Air Force. U.S. submarines cut off the shipment of oil 
from Indonesia to Japan. U.S. commanders did not stage a landing on an island until 
navy ships had bombarded an island for some time while planes dropped bomb aft er 
bomb. Once an island was secure, the Seabees (the navy term for uniformed construction 
workers) moved in and with amazing speed built airfi elds, shelters, and bases. 
In June 1944, the United States began a campaign to retake the Philippine Islands. 
In October, the American and Japanese navies engaged in one of the largest sea battles 
in history, involving 282 ships and over 200,000 sailors off of Leyte Island. Th e U.S. 
fl eet was victorious in spite of the continuing strengths of the Japanese Navy and the 
use of suicide kamikaze planes, basically planes that were used as bombs. 
General MacArthur, who had left Corregidor under cover of darkness in early 1942, 
waded ashore facing carefully located cameras on October 20, 1944, and announced, 
“People of the Philippines, I have returned.…Th e hour of your redemption is here.” 
In spite of MacArthur’s heroics, the Japanese were able to reinforce Luzon, the main 
island of the Philippines, and major battles during the fi rst 3 months of 1945 took 
place before the United States secured control of its former colony. Manila, the city 
that young service men had considered a paradise in 1941, was now a city of rubble. 
In some of the fi ercest fi ghting of the war, U.S. Marines seized Iwo Jima island 
in February and March 1945, moving ever closer to Japan itself. Th e attacks on Iwo 
Jima and those on some of the earlier islands were aided by Navajo code talkers who 
relayed messages in the Navajo language—a code the Japanese were never able to 
break. Iwo Jima was tiny, only 4.5 miles by 2.5 miles, but U.S. control of its airfi eld and 
radar meant that U.S. bombers going to Japan had a much shorter fl ight. 
After a long navy bombardment, Marines landed on the beach at Iwo Jima 
on February 19 and sank into the volcanic sand. In spite of the bombardment, the 
Japanese forces on the island were still strong, and fi erce hand-to-hand combat followed 
the landing. Th e Japanese refused to surrender, and many died at the hands 
of new U.S. flamethrowers that literally incinerated them. Associated Press photographer 
Joe Rosenthal took his famous photo of the Marines raising the flag on 
Mount Suribachi on February 23, but the fi ghting went on for another month. Of the 
21,000 Japanese defending the island, over 20,000 died in combat. 
The battle for Okinawa in April to June of 1945 was equally brutal, some 
70,000 Japanese troops and 100,000 Okinawan civilians as well as almost 
8,000 Americans died there. By June 1945, with the war in Europe over and after 
intense fi ghting in the Pacifi c, the U.S. forces in the Pacifi c were close to a landing on 
Japan itself. But it never happened. 
The Atomic Era Begins 
While armies and navies clashed, a small team of U.S. scientists had begun work in 
1942 on a top-secret venture, code-named the Manhattan Project . Enrico Fermi won 
the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1938 and used the prize money to leave fascist Italy 
for New York. In March 1939, Fermi warned that recent research, including his own, 
in atomic physics pointed to the potential development of a new form of weapon. 
When Fermi went to the U.S. Navy Department, a receptionist announced, “Th ere’s 
a wop outside.” Th e offi cers who received him were not much more interested. But 
some of the world’s best known physicists, many of whom were Jewish refugees from 
Nazi Germany (11 German Jewish refugees would eventually win the Nobel Prize), 
were determined that the U.S. government needed to act before the Nazis. A group 
draft ed a letter to President Roosevelt, which was signed by their most well-known 
and respected member, Albert Einstein, and delivered in the fall of 1941. Aft er considering 
the letter and the report on Nazi research, Roosevelt said simply, “Th is requires 
action.” And action, top-secret action, it got. 
Manhattan Project 
The effort, using the code name Manhattan 
Engineer District, to develop an atomic bomb 
during World War II. 
Navajo code talkers like these fought on Pacifi c 
islands, but by communicating in the native 
Navajo language, were able to establish a means 
of communication that the Japanese, expert at 
breaking American coded messages, were never 
able to understand.

Th e Manhattan Project began under a stadium at the University of Chicago, where 
the fi rst chain reaction was achieved in December 1942. Th en, under the scientifi c 
direction of physicist Robert J. Oppenheimer and the military oversight of General 
Leslie Groves, the work moved to the isolated town of Los Alamos, New Mexico, 
where it was easier to keep it secret. The scientists bent all of their efforts to beating 
Germany in the development of “the bomb,” that they now knew they could 
build. Ironically, part way through the war, Germany suspended further research on 
atomic warfare because of the cost and because Hitler considered atomic physics to be 
“Jewish physics.” However, the Americans did not know that and kept going. In Oak 
Ridge, Tennessee, TVA dams provided the power for the extraction of U-235 (a form 
of Uranium), and at Hanford, Washington, other New Deal dams, the Bonneville and 
Grand Coulee, drove the plants that squeezed plutonium out of uranium. With those 
ingredients, the engineers at Los Alamos could build their bomb. 
Over $2 billion dollars was spent on the project and 150,000 people were involved, 
though only a tiny percentage had any idea of what they were working on. Th e Danish 
physicist Niels Bohr who had once said that the United States could not produce an 
atomic bomb “unless you turn the United States into one huge factory,” reviewed 
the work in 1945 and said, “You have done just that.” Th ey had. On July 16, 1945, 
Oppenheimer and his team tested the fi rst bomb in the Nevada desert. Th at evening, 
they sent a top-secret telegram to President Truman, “Operated on this morning. 
Diagnosis not yet complete but results seem satisfactory and already exceed expectations.” 
Truman, who had been briefed in April, understood fully. 
While people in the postwar era have debated the morality of using something of the 
power of the atomic bomb, few in the administration seem to have had any doubts about it. 
By 1945, the war had come to a point where the actors would use any weapon they could. 
As scientists developed the atom bomb, regular bombs were doing their work on 
Japan. Boeing B-29s were dropping tons of explosives on Japanese cities. Th e fi rebombing 
of Tokyo in February and March 1945 killed almost a million people and 
left 8 million homeless, far more than either atomic bomb. Still, there was something 
unique in the use of a single bomb, harnessing the power used in the sun, for warfare. 
On August 6, 1945, Air Force Colonel Paul Tibbets piloted a B-29 named the 
Enola Gay that took off from recently captured Tinian Island. The plane carried 
a single bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima, killing 40,000 people instantly and

This picture of Nagasaki gives some sense of the total devastation caused by a single atomic bomb on what 
had previously been a large urban area. 

Chapter 23 Living in a World at War 719 
23.2 
P 23.3 resident Harry Truman was clear: “The final decision of where 
and when to use the atomic bomb was up to me.… Let there 
be no doubt about it. I regarded the bomb as a military weapon 
and never had any doubt that it should be used.” None of the 
president’s inner circle seem to have had any doubts about dropping 
the atomic bomb on a major city in Japan either, and few 
beyond that circle knew anything about the top-secret project 
until news of the bombing of Hiroshima reached the world on 
August 6, 1945. For soldiers and sailors facing the invasion of 
Japan, word of the bomb’s use was seen only as a blessing. The 
then 20-year-old sailor Alvin Kernan remembered, “Each of us 
felt, further, that those two bombs had saved our lives—not 
life in general, but our own felt, breathing life. No one who was 
not there will ever understand how fatalistically we viewed the 
invasion of Japan.…[E]ach of us felt that survival was unlikely.” 
Some, however, did argue for a different course of action. U.S. 
Army Chief of Staff General George C. Marshall worried about 
the “opprobrium which might follow from an ill-considered 
employment of such force.” Some senior military leaders had 
moral qualms about the killing of so many civilians if the bomb 
was dropped on a Japanese city. 
Some of the physicists who helped develop the bomb also 
argued for a different course of action. Leo Szilard and James Franck, 
key researchers on the Manhattan Project, recommended that 
instead of dropping the bomb on a city it first be used on a “desert 
or a barren island” to show Japan what might be coming. They also 
said that once the first atomic bomb was dropped, a new arms race 
“will be on in earnest not later than the morning after our first demonstration 
of the existence of nuclear weapons,” and they argued for 
putting international controls of nuclear weapons in place. Szilard 
also organized a petition signed by 68 Manhattan Project scientists, 
raising questions about the arms race they feared would come. 
So why did Truman ignore these recommendations and order 
that an atomic bomb be dropped on Hiroshima and 3 days later 
on Nagasaki? Could he have opted for the idea of a demonstration 
explosion first? Was the bombing of Nagasaki necessary 
before the Japanese government even had time to consider the 
implications of the bombing of Hiroshima? At the time, and for 
the rest of his life, Truman insisted that he had made the decisions 
himself and never—then or later—had any doubts about 
them. Still, historians debate the reasons for his action. Because 
the United States had access to many Japanese secret cables, 
Truman knew that the country was under enormous pressure to 
end the war but nevertheless still had resources to keep fighting. 
Early in the war, President Roosevelt and the other allied leaders 
had agreed that only unconditional surrender by Germany 
and Japan would be acceptable, and in July 1945, Truman, 
Churchill, and Stalin reaffirmed that only the “unconditional surrender 
of all Japanese armed forces” would end the war and that 
the only “alternative is prompt and utter destruction of Japan.” 
Truman also knew that the Soviet Union had promised to join 
the war against Japan once the war in Europe was over, and 
some have argued that Truman was determined to show Stalin 
the full extent of American power by defeating Japan first. U.S. 
military leaders estimated that the United States might lose 
200,000 soldiers and sailors in the planned November invasion 
of Japan, and Truman certainly wanted to avoid that death toll. 
Some have also seen the bombing as revenge for the bombing 
of Pearl Harbor in 1941. Certainly, 4 years of terrible warfare had 
hardened everyone. Documents, most finally declassified in the 
1990s, lead different historians to many different conclusions 
about why President Truman made the specific decisions he did. 
There probably will not be a final answer.

an additional 100,000 from burns and radiation. Three days, later another atomic 
bomb was dropped on Nagasaki. Japanese leaders debated what to do. Some diehard 
Japanese militarists wanted to keep fi ghting no matter what and saw the “peace faction” 
as traitors. Finally, Emperor Hirohito, who had been silent through so much of 
the war said, “I swallow my own tears, and give my sanctions to the proposal to accept 
the Allied proclamation.” On August 15, Japanese radio carried a voice never heard in 
Japan before, that of the Emperor, who told his people that the unthinkable had come 
about; Japan had surrendered. World War II was over.

INTERESTS IN THE PACIFIC 
THEATER OF WORLD 
WAR II? 
As the United States built its overseas 
colonies in the Pacifi c during the decades 
prior to World War II, Japanese leaders, 
who were trying to build a colonial empire 
for their own country, felt threatened. 
Industrialization and a growing population 
in Japan meant that the country needed 
more resources than the home islands 
could provide. Following the example of 
European colonial powers, Japan began its 
own course of expansion during the late 
1800s. Soon the empire of Japan acquired 
Korea, China, and islands in the Pacifi c as 
tributary colonies. Imperial competition 
with the United States prompted a surprise 
attack on the American naval base at Pearl 
Harbor on December 7, 1941, bringing the 
United States into World War II. Initially the 
Japanese enjoyed military success across 
the Pacifi c, but soon the United States 
began to push the Japanese forces back 
toward the home islands. Both before and 
during the course of the war, the Japanese

As word spread of the Japanese surrender, huge crowds celebrated from San 
Francisco to New York City. Similar crowds celebrated in London, Paris, Moscow, 
and Beijing. Most people breathed a huge sigh of relief. Th e most terrible war in modern 
history was over. Few knew what the postwar world would look like. 
On September 2, the U.S. battleship Missouri sailed into Tokyo Bay. A Japanese 
delegation came on board to sign the instruments of surrender while an advance unit 
of U.S. sailors and Marines landed to begin the occupation of Japan. It was a short, 
somber ceremony. A new era had begun. 
Quick Review How did U.S. strategy differ in Europe and the Pacifi c? Why were these 
differences necessary? What was the key to U.S. success? 
CONCLUSION 
By the end of 1939, Europe was once again at war. Both Great Britain and France 
had declared war on Germany shortly aft er the German invasion of Poland. By June 
1940, France had surrendered to a sustained German assault. Now Britain stood alone 
against fascism. At the same time, tensions mounted between the United States and 
Japan. Even those Americans who suspected that a war was coming hoped to avoid a 
war with Germany and Japan at the same time. 
British Prime Minister Winston Churchill asked the United States for assistance 
in resisting Germany, but President Roosevelt was hampered by both the neutrality 
legislation of the 1930s and by public opposition to involvement in another European 
confl ict. Th rough a series of complex maneuvers, Roosevelt managed to provide some 
military aid to Britain; however, full-scale U.S. involvement in World War II would 
not come until the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. 
During the war, 16 million Americans served in the armed forces, including 
350,000 women. As the country shift ed from peacetime to wartime industrial production, 
jobs were plentiful and Americans experienced unprecedented prosperity. 
Even during this time of rapid industrial expansion, racial and ethnic discrimination 
continued. African-Americans and Latinos, though many served in the military, were 
oft en marginalized. Ethnic hostility on the home front also resulted in the internment 
100,000 Japanese Americans living on the West Coast. By contrast, the principle of 
equal opportunity regardless of race, creed, color, or national origin was upheld by 
Executive Order 8802, which prohibited defense contractors from refusing to integrate 
their labor forces. Many people from previously marginalized groups were able 
to fi nd new opportunities during the war, and others returned form the war determined 
to resist future discrimination. 
During the course of the war, the Soviet Union (Russia), which had originally 
been allied with Germany, was then attacked by Germany. After fierce fighting in 
the Russian winter, Russian forces began to counterattack against Germany from the 
east while British and American forces attacked from the west—fi rst in North Africa 
and Italy and later directly into France and Germany. Aft er years of fi ghting, Nazi 
Germany was eventually forced to surrender, in April 1945, just aft er Roosevelt died 
in offi ce. Aft er the German surrender, the United States, under the leadership of Harry 
S. Truman, who had ascended to the presidency aft er Roosevelt’s death, focused on 
the war in the Pacifi c, and in August 1945, Truman made the controversial decision 
to drop two atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which 
became the fi rst two cities in the world to be leveled by atomic blasts. Japan surrendered, 
bringing World War II to a close. In September 1945, the world entered a new 
era as it had only a few times in history.

Summary 
With Britain isolated and under intense military pressure from 
Germany, Roosevelt sought ways to circumvent neutrality legislation 
and aid Britain. Despite fi erce opposition from American 
isolationists, Roosevelt steadily increased American assistance 
to Britain at the same time that he worked to convince the 
American public that America’s national interests depended on 
Britain’s survival. While the U.S. focused on Europe, tensions 
were also building in the Pacifi c. American policy makers tried 
to use economic sanctions to curtail Japanese expansion in 
Asia. In response, the Japanese launched a surprise attack on 
Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on December 7, 1941. Within days, the 
United States was at war with both Japan and Germany.

Summary 
Early on, Allied planners decided to focus on an off ensive in

war was declared, millions of young American men were draft ed 
into the military. White racism shaped the draft and the assignments 
offered to African-American service members. More 
than in previous wars, conscientious objectors were offered 
alternative service. Although women were not drafted, some 
350,000 women volunteered for service. Millions more entered 
the workforce, with 2 million women working in defense plants.

WINNING A WORLD WAR—NORTH AFRICA, EUROPE, ASIA, 
THE PACIFIC, 1943–1945 
Explain the course of the war leading to victory in Europe and 
then the Pacifi c. 
Summary 
Th e year 1943 was the turning point in the war. Aft er the Soviet 
victory at Stalingrad, the Soviets went on the off ensive, pushing 
forward towards Germany. Allied victories in North Africa led 
to the invasion of Italy. Once much of Italy and North Africa 
were secure, Allied bombing raids on Germany intensifi ed. On 
June 6, 1944, the Allied invasion of France began. By early 1945, 
American and British troops were moving into Germany. As 
they did so, they discovered the full reality of the Nazi death 
camps. When Roosevelt died in April 1945, Vice President 
Harry Truman became president. With the war in Europe over, 
the Allies turned their attention to the Pacifi c. Progress was slow 
and bloody, and many feared that the final invasion of Japan 
would cost more than a million American lives. It was against

boundary here claimed its fi ft h victim in pistol battles 
when Henry Renfro, a Colored man, was killed. 
Renfro was killed when he was caught between a volley of rifl e and 
pistol shots from police offi cers and smugglers, near the Mexican line. 
Renfro, according to Claude Smith, captain of detectives, had off ered 
to guide Captain Smith and another offi cer to a place where he said 
smugglers would cross during the night. Arriving near this place the 
offi cers said Renfro turned on them, drew a gun and opened fi re, 
while at the same time other shots were fi red at the police offi cers. 
It had not been determined as yet whether a bullet from a police 
gun or from the opposing side killed Renfro.

Questions 7.12–7.14 refer to the following document. 
If one judges by appearances, I suppose I am a fl apper. I am 
within the age limit. I wear bobbed hair, the badge of fl apperhood. 
(And, oh, what a comfort it is!) I powder my nose. I wear 
fringed skirts and bright-colored sweaters, and scarfs, and waists 
[blouses] with Peter Pan collars, and low-heeled “fi nale hopper” 
shoes. I adore to dance. I spend a large amount of time in automobiles. 
I attend hops, and proms, and ball-games, and crew 
races, and other aff airs at men’s colleges. But none the less some 
of the most thoroughbred superfl appers might blush to claim 
sistership or even remote relationship with such as I. I don’t use 
rouge, or lipstick, or pluck my eyebrows. I don’t smoke (I’ve tried 
it, and don’t like it), or drink. . . . 
I want to beg all you parents, and grandparents, and friends, 
and teachers, and preachers—you who constitute the “older 
generation”—to overlook our shortcomings, at least for the present, 
and to appreciate our virtues. I wonder if it ever occurred to 
any of you that it required brains to become and remain a successful 
fl apper? Indeed it does! It requires an enormous amount 
of cleverness and energy to keep going at the proper pace. 
It requires self-knowledge and self-analysis. We must know our 
capabilities and limitations. We must be constantly on the alert. 
Attainment of fl apperhood is a big and serious undertaking! 
“Brains?” you repeat, skeptically. “Th en why aren’t they used 
to better advantage?” Th at is exactly it! . . . “Th e war!” you cry. 
“It is the eff ect of the war!” And then you blame prohibition. . . . 
But this is my point: Instead of helping us work out our problems 
with constructive, sympathetic thinking and acting, you have 
muddled them for us more hopelessly with destructive public 
condemnation and denunciation. . . . 
We are the Younger Generation. Th e war tore away our spiritual 
foundations and challenged our faith. We are struggling to 
regain our equilibrium. Th e times have made us older and more 
experienced than you were at our age. . . .

Questions 7.19–7.21 refer to the following document. 
I’ve always said, and I still think we have to admit, that no matter 
how much fi ne reasoning there was about the old-age insurance 
system and the unemployment insurance prospects—no matter 
how many people were studying it, or how many committees had 
ideas on the subject, or how many college professors had written 
theses on the subject—and there were an awful lot of them—the 
real roots of the Social Security Act were in the great depression of 
1929. Nothing else would have bumped the American people into 
a social security system except something so shocking, so terrifying, 
as that depression. . . . 
In the spring of 1932, Franklin Roosevelt had gone out to Utah 
to the Conference of Governors. . . . He made a speech which 
was full of pleasant hyperbole of one sort or another—fl attery 
to various Governors—but at one point he began to discuss 
the great problems now facing this country, and he spoke 
about unemployment. Th en he said, “I am for unemployment 
insurance but not for the dole.” 
—Former Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins, “The Roots of 
Social Security,” 1962 
7.19 Former Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins argues that 
the main reason for implementing Social Security in the 
United States in the 1930s was what? 
a. Th e Great Depression 
b. Th e Bonus Marchers 
c. Republican support 
d. Its inclusion in the U.S. Constitution 
7.20 How did the author of this document view the Social 
Security program? 
a. As an unnecessary and expensive program 
b. As a necessary program, but one that needed limits 
c. As a socialist and unconstitutional program 
d. As a program that should be used only in economic 
depressions 
7.21 Many people had opposing viewpoints toward 
employment insurance during the 1930s. What did 
President Roosevelt most likely mean when he said, “I am 
for unemployment insurance but not for the dole”? 
a. He supported unemployment checks and assistance, 
but not handouts to people who were not trying to 
support themselves. 
b. He supported universal assistance for all Americans, 
those with and without gainful employment. 
c. He supported unemployment insurance but not oldage 
insurance, believing that people who could work, 
should work. 
d. He supported unemployment insurance for people who 
were quitting jobs that were unfair or unsafe. 
Questions 7.22–7.24 refer to the following document. 
Americans could not see that future clearly in 1945, but they 
could look back over the war they had just waged. Th ey might 
have refl ected with some discomfort on how slowly they had 
awakened to the menace of Hitlerism in the isolationist 1930s; 
on how callously they had barred the door to those seeking to 
fl ee from Hitler’s Europe; on how heedlessly they had provoked 
Japan into a probably avoidable war in a region where few 
American interests were at stake; on how they had largely fought 
with America’s money and machines and with Russia’s men, 
had fought in Europe only late in the day, against a foe mortally 
weakened by three years of brutal warfare in the east, had fought 
in the Pacifi c with a bestiality they did not care to admit; on how 
they had profaned their constitution by interning tens of thousands 
of citizens largely because of their race; on how they had 
denied most black Americans a chance to fi ght for their country; 
on how they had sullied their nation’s moral standards with 
terror bombing in the closing months of the war; on how their 
leaders’ stubborn insistence on unconditional surrender had led 
to the incineration of hundreds of thousands of already defeated 
Japanese, fi rst by fi re raids, then by nuclear blast. . . . 
—David M. Kennedy, Freedom from Fear, 1999 
7.22 What is highlighted in this passage?

Questions 7.25–7.27 refer to the following document. 
In the history of New York, the signifi cance of the name Harlem has 
changed from Dutch to Irish to Jewish to Negro. Of these changes, 
the last has come most swift ly. Th roughout colored America, from 
Massachusetts to Mississippi, and across the continent to Los Angeles 
and Seattle, its name, which as late as fi ft een years ago had scarcely 
been heard, now stands for the Negro metropolis. Harlem is indeed 
the great Mecca for the sight-seer, the pleasure-seeker, the curious, 
the adventurous, the enterprising, the ambitious and the talented of 
the whole Negro world; for the lure of it has reached down to every 
island of the Carib Sea and has penetrated even into Africa. 
In the make-up of New York, Harlem is not merely a Negro 
colony or community, it is a city within a city, the greatest Negro 
city in the world. It is not a slum or a fringe, it is located in the 
heart of Manhattan and occupies one of the most beautiful and 
healthful sections of the city. It is not a “quarter” of dilapidated 
tenements, but is made up of new-law apartments and handsome 
dwellings, with well-paved and well-lighted streets. It has 
its own churches, social and civic centers, shops, theaters and 
other places of amusement. And it contains more Negroes to the 
square mile than any other spot on earth. . . . 
I believe that the Negro’s advantages and opportunities are 
greater in Harlem than in any other place in the country, and 
that Harlem will become the intellectual, the cultural and the 
fi nancial center for Negroes of the United States, and will exert a 
vital infl uence upon all Negro peoples. 
—James Weldon Johnson, “Harlem: The Culture Capital,” 1925 
7.25 Which of the following best describes the Harlem 
Renaissance? 
a. Th e blossoming growth and acceptance of African 
American culture in Harlem 
b. Th e rebirth of African American culture and push to 
end segregation 
c. Th e push to return to Harlem, Africa, and re-embrace 
traditional African culture 
d. Th e emergence of a new, empowered African American 
culture in the South 
7.26 Which of the following movements contributed to the 
growing population of Harlem during the early 1900s? 
a. Immigration from Eastern Europe 
b. Th e Great Migration 
c. Th e Dust Bowl migrations 
d. Refugee movements from Africa 
7.27 According to the passage, which of the following ideas 
does the author support? 
a. Although Harlem is the current center for African 
American arts, it will not expand much past that. 
b. Harlem is the epicenter of the push for racial equality, 
and racial segregation should be ended immediately 
throughout the United States. 
c. Harlem is a refugee center for African Americans who 
wish to escape the segregation of the South. 
d. Harlem is a center of African American culture, and it 
will infl uence people far beyond its physical reaches in 
the United States and world. 
Section II: Short Answer Questions 
Question 7.28 refers to the following two quotations. 
Passage 1 
But the deepest problem was the intervention, the lack of faith in 
the marketplace. Government management of the late 1920s and 
1930s hurt the economy. Both Hoover and Roosevelt misstepped 
in a number of ways. . . . Roosevelt’s errors had a diff erent quality 
but were equally devastating. He created regulatory, aid, 
and relief agencies based on the premise that recovery could 
be achieved only through a large military-style eff ort. Some of 
these were useful—the fi nancial institutions he established upon 
entering offi ce. Some were inspiring—the Civilian Conservation 
Corps, for example, which created parks, bridges, and roads we 
still enjoy today. . . . Other new institutions, such as the National 
Recovery Administration, did damage. Th e NRA’s mandate mistook 
macroeconomic problems for micro problems—it sought to 
solve monetary challenges through price setting. NRA rules were 
so stringent they perversely hurt businesses. Th ey frightened away 
capital, and they discouraged employers from hiring workers. . . . 
From 1929 to 1940, from Hoover to Roosevelt, government intervention 
helped make the Depression Great. 
—Amity Shlaes, The Forgotten Man, 2007 
Passage 2 
Critics on the right, ranging from Herbert Hoover to economic 
historians of the 1980s and 1990s, have argued that Roosevelt 
artifi cially created a crisis in 1933, used the analogy of wartime 
emergency, and fostered economic regimentation and government 
control onto the American people. . . . Th e desperate need 
of ordinary Americans meant that Roosevelt and Congress did 
not have the luxury of such a hands-off policy. . . . Roosevelt gave 
indispensable assistance to many Americans in the summer of 
1933. He instigated a regulatory regime for fi nancial institutions 
that prevented a repeat of the Great Crash. He made a start on a 
massive program of investment in the physical infrastructure of 
the United States. What he had not found in 1933 was the magic 
key to economic recovery. But in the Hundred Days Roosevelt 
demonstrated that a democracy need not be paralyzed in the face 
of economic catastrophe. He inspired a new generation of public 
servants for whom government service was an honorable, disinterested 
calling. Th ey would enable the United States to survive 
the worst depression in the nation’s history with its democratic 
institutions intact and with enough social cohesion and government 
and productive capacity to fi ght a successful world war.

Members of 11th Airborne Division kneel on the ground as they watch the 
mushroom cloud of a 1951 atomic bomb test in Nevada. Threat of the new 
weapon hung over the world during the Cold War. 
The World the War 
Created 
On August 6, 1945, the White House released a statement from 
President Harry Truman: 
Sixteen hours ago an American airplane dropped one bomb on 
Hiroshima.…It is an atomic bomb. It is a harnessing of the basic 
power of the universe. Th e force from which the sun draws its power 
has been loosed against those who brought war to the Far East. 
Th us began the atomic age, a new and previously unimagined era. Th e bomb 
brought World War II to a quick end, but it also launched the United States 
and the world into an uncharted arena. For people living in the United 
States in 1945, that announcement was but one of many extraordinary 
changes that year. 
In early May, less than a month aft er Roosevelt’s death on April 12, Nazi 
Germany surrendered. In June, the United Nations, a new international 
organization designed to preserve peace, held its fi rst meeting. Th en came 
the news of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima on August 6 and Nagasaki on 
August 9. Japan surrendered on August 14. World War II was over. 
During the 2-day holiday that followed, Americans celebrated the coming 
of peace. Few had any sense of what peace would mean. People wanted to 
get on with their lives, even if it was hard to imagine what the new “normal”

might look like. A Navy petty offi cer and his wife, walking hand in hand through the 
celebrations in Seattle on August 14, told a reporter their plans: “Raise babies and keep 
house!” Many returning from the war followed these plans, but they did so in a world 
much more complex than could be imagined on that idyllic August evening. This 
chapter traces the experience of those Americans who built a new world in the aft ermath 
of World War II, describing not only their hopes and fears but also their surprises 
and disappointments as the postwar world took shape between 1945 and 1952. 
THE UNITED STATES IN 1945 
Describe the new technology, living patterns, and political arrangements in the United 
States that resulted from World War II. 
Th ose who had been fi ghting in Europe or Asia wanted to get home as fast as they 
could, certainly faster than was possible given diffi culties in transporting troops and 
managing Germany and Japan. For some women working in wartime production, it 
was time to welcome a long-absent husband or boyfriend, quit work, and raise a family. 
Other women very much wanted to continue working. For some who had moved 
because of the war, it was time to go home. Others who had moved wanted to stay 
in their new locations and have families join them. For industrial leaders, peacetime 
conversion meant new profi ts that would come from fulfi lling pent-up demands for 
goods that had been unavailable during the war and from harnessing new discoveries 
related to medicines and emerging technologies. For government leaders, negotiating 
the international arrangements and managing the uneasy postwar alliances, especially 
with the United Soviet Socialist Republic (U.S.S.R.), commonly called the Soviet 
Union, made the postwar era one of the most diffi cult ever. 
Science, Medicine, Technology, and the Bomb 
If the nuclear physicists who designed and built the atomic bomb were in the vanguard 
of wartime scientifi c breakthroughs, biologists and medical researchers were not 
far behind. During World War II, the wonder drugs—penicillin and streptomycin— 
combated infections and resulted in a dramatic reduction in battlefi eld deaths. Soon 
aft er the war, medical scientists and pharmaceutical companies marketed other new 
antibiotics. Th e National Institutes of Health, which had begun as a tiny government 
agency in the 1930s, now led the nation’s war on disease. 
By 1956, 80 percent of prescribed drugs had been invented aft er the beginning 
of World War II. Vaccines ended traditional childhood diseases such as whooping 
cough, diphtheria, mumps, and measles. In 1955, a vaccine was found for the feared 
scourge of polio. For those having a hard time keeping pace with modern life, physicians 
off ered tranquilizers, sales of which boomed. People were growing taller and 
living longer thanks to advances in medicine, nutrition, and hygiene. In 1940, the 
average American’s lifespan was 62.9 years, but by 1960 it had reached 69.7. Science, it 
seemed, was off ering the key to life itself. 
For consumers, science and technology offered tangible improvements that 
changed daily life. In 1945, consumers were being introduced to freezers, dishwashers, 
automatic transmissions, and ballpoint pens. In offi ces, workers were beginning to use 
electric typewriters. Other technologies that had been developed prior to World War II 
—from washing machines to electric ranges to electric trains—were suddenly available 
aft er wartime production restrictions were lift ed. Pent-up consumer demand and 
industrial availability combined quickly. What had been impossible to fi nd during the 
war was now in every store. 
No automobiles for private use had been produced in the United States between 
1942 and 1945. But by 1947, new models were replacing the old vehicles from the 
1930s. Sales of passenger cars jumped to 6.7 million per year in 1950 and to 7.9 million

in 1955. General Motors, which then sold about half of all cars in America, became 
the fi rst corporation to earn $1 billion in a single year. Advertising by General Motors, 
Ford, and Chrysler convinced people to trade in 4.5 million old cars per year in the 
1950s for large, sleek new models with automatic transmissions, air conditioning, and 
picturesque tail fi ns. By 1960, 80 percent of all American families owned a car, and 
15 percent owned two or more cars. 
While most households had radios in 1945, only a very few had televisions (black and 
white, of course). Television was developed by a number of inventors, notably Philo T. 
Farnsworth in the early 1930s, and was introduced at the 1939 New York World’s Fair. 
But television production stopped during World War II while factories made radar equipment. 
Th e number of television sets in American homes exploded aft er the war. In 1946, 
8,000 homes owned a set; by 1950, 5 million; and by 1960, 45 million—or 90 percent of all 
American homes. In 1945, half of the nation’s farm homes, where 25 million people lived, 
still did not have electricity to plug in a TV, but that too would change very quickly. 
Hanging over all of the advances, however, was the atomic bomb. As Americans 
learned more about the bomb, they realized that it could end all of their improved 
health and new-found prosperity. Few Americans had questioned the morality of 
using the atomic bomb in 1945; indeed, only a tiny handful even knew that the weapon 
existed before its use. Th e few physicists who had developed the bomb understood 
what it meant, however. Very soon, many more came to understand the sobering reality 
of “the mushroom cloud” that a nuclear explosion unleashed. “Th e bomb” might 
be a new form of protection, since only the United States had it, but it was also a new 
threat (see Chapter 23 ) . 
Some scientists proposed the voluntary sharing of atomic technology to avoid an arms 
race, but President Truman decided that the safest course was for the United States to 
retain sole knowledge of nuclear secrets. However, in 1949, to the great surprise of many, 
the Soviet Union successfully tested its own atomic bomb. By that time, the wartime ally 
had become a potential enemy. Suddenly, with the Russian test, the idea that the United 
States was protected by its unique control of the bomb vanished. Before long, other 
nations joined the “atomic club.” Great Britain, the closest U.S. ally, exploded its own 
bomb in 1952, France followed in 1960, and others were not far behind. Above all other 
concerns, however, the fear of the Russian bomb is what hung over Americans. 
Offi cials and scientists within the Truman administration debated the development 
of an even more powerful weapon to counter the Russian bomb. Th e atomic 
bomb depended on nuclear fi ssion (the splitting of an atom), but scientists knew that 
theoretically an even more powerful explosion could arise from nuclear fusion (the 
merging of atoms) to create a thermonuclear explosion—a hydrogen bomb. While 
virtually no one involved opposed the development of the atomic bomb during World 
War II, many senior scientists opposed the “super bomb.” Albert Einstein, whose 
scientifi c work formed the basis for nuclear science, said that with such a super bomb, 
“general annihilation beckons.” J. Robert Oppenheimer, who led the development 
of the first atomic bomb at Los Alamos, New Mexico, in 1944, opposed the larger 
bomb on moral and practical grounds. George Kennan, the state department offi cial 
often most associated with the coming of the Cold War, argued that an arsenal of 
atom bombs was ample deterrent for the Soviets. Others disagreed. When President 
Truman asked his advisory panel, “Can the Russians do it?” even those who opposed 
development of the hydrogen bomb had to answer yes. Th e president responded, “In 
that case, we have no choice. We’ll go ahead.” 
Th e science and the engineering involved were daunting. When many of those 
who had built the first atomic bombs declined to participate in the new project, a 
fresh team, led by Hungarian refugees Edward Teller and John von Neumann, moved 
ahead. Th e fi rst U.S. test of a thermonuclear bomb took place on November 1, 1952, 
at Eniwetok Atoll in the Pacifi c. Th e predictions about the Russian capabilities also 
became true: the fi rst Russian bomb was exploded in Siberia in August 1953, little 
more than 9 months aft er the fi rst U.S. test.

The bombs that the United States and Russia exploded were powerful beyond 
imagination. Th e United States test sent a fi reball 5 miles into the sky and produced 
a mushroom cloud 27 miles high and 8 miles wide. Eniwetok Island disappeared, 
replaced by a large hole in the ocean floor. The Soviet bomb was similar. Soviet 
Premier Georgi Malenkov told the world that “the United States no longer has a 
monopoly on the hydrogen bomb.” Th e possibility of “mutually assured destruction,” 
infl uenced international diplomacy and daily life. Children practiced hiding under 
school desks in case of nuclear attack, (though critics wondered what good that would 
do in the face of a bomb that could vaporize a city.) Families built bomb shelters in 
their basements. Th e bomb was as much a part of daily life in the 1950s as televisions, 
new automobiles, or healthier lives. 
Returning Veterans, the Baby Boom, and Suburban Homes 
In August 1945, as World War II ended, 12 million American men were in the military, 
two-thirds of those between the ages of 18 and 34. Th ey had been through a brutal 
war, and now they wanted get home and get on with their lives. Th ose waiting at home 
were equally anxious to get the troops back. It took time to organize the military governance 
of Germany and Japan and to arrange the transport of troops. By fall, members 
of Congress started to get warning letters, “No boats, no votes.” Demobilization 
moved at a rapid pace. In less than a year, three-quarters of those in the military had 
been mustered out, leaving an active military of 3 million. Congress voted to cut that 
number to 1 million in another year. 
Coming home from the war was joyous but also diffi cult. Soldiers and sailors, desperately 
tired of the killing, the dying, and the boredom of war, sometimes had a hard 
time adjusting to a world where life had gone on without them and in which civilians 
could never comprehend the horrors they had experienced. Married couples who had 
been apart, sometimes for 3 or 4 years, especially those who had married just before a 
husband shipped out, found adjustments diffi cult. Th e divorce rate skyrocketed in the 
late 1940s. 
Th e government off ered generous benefi ts to returning service men (and the few 
service women) to help with the adjustment. Th e GI Bill of Rights provided $20 per 
week for up to a year for those seeking new jobs. (Th e maximum payment of $1,040 
for a full year was very close to the average American salary of $1,074 in 1945.) Th e GI 
Bill also off ered college tuition for returning veterans, allowing a whole generation of 
young men to be the fi rst in their families to attend college and prepare for middleclass 
occupations. In addition, the Veterans Administration made loans available for 
veterans to buy a house. Only later would some note that since the draft oft en passed 
over African-Americans and Latinos and excluded women, the GI Bill constituted a 
kind of affi rmative action for white men. But in 1945, most Americans thought that 
these men had richly earned any favors they got. 
Perhaps the greatest goal of returning veterans and the spouses and fi ancées who 
met them was stated by the couple who wanted to “Raise babies and keep house!” Th ey 
did both with amazing speed. Many veterans married very quickly, and the new couples 
started to have babies. In May 1946, 9 months aft er the end of the war, 233,452 babies 
were born in the United States, up from 206,387 earlier that February. In June, the 
number of babies was 242,302, and in October, 339,499. A total of 3.4 million babies 
were born in the United States in 1946, 20 percent more than were born in 1945, a 
birthrate unmatched in the United States in decades, though it kept climbing aft er that. 
Th e speed with which returning veterans chose to marry and have children came as 
quite a surprise. Nothing similar had followed other wars, certainly not World War I, 
even though “normalcy” had been a theme of the 1920s. Nevertheless, Americans 
across the spectrum of class and race started having children. Th e population soared, 
and a generation known as the “ baby boomers ” became a demographic bulge whose 
sheer size aff ected many aspects of American life throughout boomer lifespans.

For white middle-class Americans, a new home located in a suburban 
neighborhood offered the chance to build a safe and modern life. It was to these 
new homes, cut off from daily interchange with their extended families but connected 
to others very much like themselves, that a generation of Americans 
moved after 1945. 
Just as these new families were getting started, Abraham Levitt and his sons William 
and Alfred bought 4,000 acres of potato farms in the town of Hempstead, Long Island, 
outside of New York City. On this huge parcel of land, the Levitts built Levittown, 
the largest private housing project in American history. Th eir plan was simple: clear 
the land, lay out curving roads or lanes (never streets), pour concrete slabs every 
60 feet along these roadways, drop off a set of construction materials at each slab— 
composition rock-board and plywood—then send in construction crews armed 
with new power tools—saws, routers, and nailers—each of whom was assigned 
a specifi c step in the construction process. At the peak of production, 30 houses 
were built each day. Each had a 12- by 16-foot living room, one bathroom, two 
bedrooms, and a fi replace. Levittown eventually included 17,400 houses that were 
home to 82,000 people. 
Occupants moved into the first houses in Levittown in October 1947. At first, 
houses were sold only to veterans but soon were sold also to other families. Modest 
down payments and Veterans Administration and Federal Housing Authority loans 
brought the price of $7,990 to $9,500 within the range of many middle-class and aspiring 
middle-class families. Long Island’s Levittown was so successful that the Levitts 
built two more planned communities near Philadelphia. Other developers—Del 
Webb in Phoenix, Joseph Kelly in Boston, Louis H. Boyar and Fritz B. Burns in Los 
Angeles—created similar developments that sold at an astounding pace. Between 1945 
and 1960, 10 times as many houses were constructed in suburbs as in older central cities, 
and 95 percent of these houses were detached single family homes. Mass production 
that had come to automobiles in the earliest 1900s came to housing aft er 1945. 
Architectural and social critics disliked suburban developments. Th e nation’s best 
known critic, Lewis Mumford, described suburbs as, 
a multitude of uniform, unidentifi able houses, lined up infl exibly, 
at uniform distances, on uniform roads, in a treeless 
communal waste, inhabited by people of the same class, the 
same income, the same age group, witnessing the same television 
performances, eating the same tasteless pre-fabricated 
foods, from the same freezers, confi rming in every outward 
and inward respect to a common mold. 
For veterans and their families and those who followed aft er 
them in the 1950s, however, the new suburbs were a dream 
come true. Immediately after the war, a desperate housing 
shortage led many to double up with parents or other relatives. 
Half a million veterans lived in army Quonset huts or 
other temporary buildings. Chicago sold 250 old trolley 
cars as temporary homes. A home of one’s own, previously 
oft en a reality only for the upper-middle class and the rich, 
now became a new norm. Th e fi rst issue of the community 
newspaper in Levittown noted that “our lives are held closely 
together because most of us are within the same age bracket, 
in similar income groups, live in almost identical houses, 
and have common problems.” Th e residents also made their 
own contribution to the baby boom to such a degree that 
the community became known as “Fertility Valley” and “the 
Rabbit Hutch.” 
With the end of World War II, many Americans 
embraced a new image of domestic bliss in a 
suburban home fi lled with children. 
A house in a subdivision like Levittown, New York, was a key part of the American 
dream for many in the 1940s and 1950s.

POPULATION SHIFT 
MAP 24-1 Americans on the Move. Many Americans moved around a lot during and after World War II, 
and many settled in communities distant from where they had been children. While African-Americans 
moved from the South to the North in large numbers, accounting for much of the population growth in 
states like New York and Illinois, white Americans moved from East to West, especially to California, which 
grew by 53 percent between 1940 and 1950. 
As many in the postwar generation moved to suburbia, Americans also moved 
from the East to the West. Between 1940 and 1950—the years of the war and the 
immediate postwar era—the Sunbelt grew rapidly. Texas grew by 20 percent, Nevada 
by 45 percent, and Arizona and California by over 50 percent (see Map 24-1 ). 
Soldiers and sailors coming through California on the way to the Pacifi c liked what 
they saw and vowed to return. However, not all young Americans could or wanted 
to participate in the rush either to the suburbs or to the West. African-Americans, 
Latinos, and Asians were excluded from most suburban developments. Levittown 
specifi cally excluded people of color from its subdivisions for the fi rst 20 years of the 
community’s existence. William Levitt believed that if blacks were allowed to move 
in to Levittown, the whites would leave. He commented, “We can solve a housing 
problem, or we can try to solve a racial problem. But we cannot combine the two.” 
As late as 1960, not a single African-American lived among the 82,000 residents of 
Levittown, New York. 
All-white developments like Levittown were not unique. Post–World War II suburbanization 
was a white aff air that greatly exacerbated housing segregation in the United 
States. Urban communities had long been segregated. Most cities had their Irish, Italian, 
and Jewish neighborhoods as well as neighborhoods for African-Americans, and in 
the Southwest, for Latinos. However, the move to the suburbs meant that many whites 
left the cities and many nonwhites were left behind in core urban communities with a 
declining tax base, declining services, and declining opportunities. 
Suburbia, however, was not an attraction for all Americans. Gay men and lesbians 
of any race were generally excluded from suburbia unless they chose to live deeply closeted 
lives. One lesbian wrote, “It has never been easy to be a lesbian in this country, but 
the 1950s was surely the worst decade in which to love your own sex.” Others simply 
preferred to stay in older urban neighborhoods or small towns. Women who worked, 
especially those who remained single or were divorced, oft en found the conformity of 
suburbia diffi cult. For the poets and playwrights who became the “beat generation” 
of the 1950s who celebrated nonconformity, suburbia was unthinkable. There was

virtually no way to get around most suburbs without a car, and for those who needed 
public transportation, cities remained essential. Nevertheless, starting in 1945, great 
numbers of American men and women moved to the suburbs and embraced life there. 
The Great Migration—African-Americans Move North 
While white Americans moved to the suburbs, a new generation of African-Americans 
moved from the South to the North. Th e great migration of African-Americans to the 
North began during World War I, continued through the 1920s, and slowed during 
the Depression years of the 1930s (see Chapter 21 ) . During and aft er World War II, 
the rate of migration exploded. By 1960, half of the nation’s African-Americans lived 
in northern cities—a huge change from the time when more than 90 percent of all 
blacks lived in the rural South. While the pull of northern industrial jobs and the push 
of southern segregation and violence remained constant from the 1920s to the 1950s, 
another factor accelerated the pace of movement in the late 1940s; the sharecropping 
system, around which the economic lives of many southern blacks had been organized 
from the 1880s to the 1940s, began to disappear. 
On October 2, 1944, as the tide of war was turning, a crowd gathered at the Hopson 
cotton plantation outside of Clarksdale, Mississippi, on Highway 49 to look at a new 
machine that had nothing to do with the war. Howell Hopson was conducting the fi rst 
In June, 1958, a sociologist, Herbert J. Gans, and his wife were 
among the first 25 families to move into the new Levittown 
development just outside Philadelphia. They lived there for the 
next 2 years as “participant observers” in this brand new planned 
suburban development. Unlike many others who wrote about 
suburbia, Gans noted more positive than negative observations. 
About the ways that living in Levittown impacted community 
and social life, one resident whom Gans interviewed said: 
We didn’t know before we moved here that we would 
entertain more, go out less. Not that we were boozehounds 
before, though. Not that we can’t afford to go out; we just 
don’t want to. We have a new house and want to keep it up 
nice; this is not work but enjoyment. I’ve never been more 
content.…Working in the yard is just like fishing, so relaxing. 
I have more pep here. 
Even if outside critics did not like what they saw in suburbia, 
Gans found that most of those who actually lived in Levittown 
did like it. 
One major exception to the general sense of happiness was 
found among adolescents. Gans interviewed one girl who complained, 
“After school hours, you walk into an entirely different 
world. Everyone goes his own separate way, to start his homework, 
take a nap, or watch TV. This is the life of a vegetable, not 
a human being.” As a result of the isolation, a car became as 
important to adolescents as it was to adults. One high school 
senior took a job to buy a car and told Gans, “I had no choice, it 
was either going to work or cracking up.…I’ll start living. I can 
get out of Levittown…. In plain words, a boy shouldn’t live here 
if he is between the ages of 14–17.” 
While he expected to find more boredom and depression 
among the sometimes-isolated residents of Levittown, he did 
not. Gans worried about the impact of suburbanization on older 
cities that were losing middle-class residents and their tax base 
leaving behind people of color—who generally didn’t or couldn’t 
move to the suburbs—and those who were poor. But in the end, 
he concluded, “I should like to emphasize once more that whatever 
its imperfections, Levittown is a good place to live.”

public demonstration of a new International Harvester cotton picking machine. He 
described the scene: “An estimated 2,500 to 3,000 people swarmed over the plantation 
on that one day, 800 to 1,000 automobiles leaving their tracks and scars throughout 
the property.” 
Th e machine that the visitors had come to see changed the face of the South, and 
changed the lives of the nation’s African-Americans. Th e bright red picker looked 
like a tractor with a large metal basket on the top. As it drove down a row of cotton, 
the spindles mounted on the front rotated and stripped the cotton off the plants and 
then suctioned the cotton up to a basket. Th e picker could pick a thousand pounds 
of cotton in an hour; a good worker, only 20 pounds. Hopson said it cost $5.26 for a 
machine to pick a bale of cotton. A sharecropper cost $39.41 per bale. He wrote, “Th e 
introduction of the cotton harvester may have been comparable to the unveiling of 
Eli Whitney’s fi rst hand-operated cotton gin.” 
Hopson was thinking of the machine’s impact on his profi ts. But like Whitney’s 
invention a century and a half earlier, the machine’s largest impact was on men and 
women of African descent. Whitney’s cotton gin made slavery profi table. International 
Harvester’s cotton picking machine made the sharecropping that had replaced slavery 
obsolete. A wave of 1.5 million African-Americans had moved North between 1910 
and 1940, but 5 million followed between 1940 and 1960. 
As people whose lives were centered in the communities, churches, and culture 
of the rigidly segregated South moved North, they now lived in quite diff erent communities 
with changing norms. Racial discrimination, generally seen as a southern 
issue until World War II, became a national one. Nevertheless, opportunities in the 
North were better than those off ered by sharecropping, and the newcomers created 
their own jobs and a new urban culture. 
Housing in the North was even more segregated than in the South. While the 
Federal Housing Authority dropped explicit racial rules by the 1940s, its handbook 
still said, “If a neighborhood is to retain stability, it is necessary that all properties 
shall continue to be occupied by the same social class.” In reality, that wording 
meant, “Don’t give mortgages to black families in white neighborhoods.” Th e white 
rush to segregated suburbs opened up new urban housing for blacks. Unscrupulous 
real estate agents made large profi ts while engaging in blockbusting in older neighborhoods, 
convincing frightened white homeowners to sell quickly and cheaply. 
From Boston to Los Angeles, whole city blocks went on the market at the same 
time, transferring the majority of homes from white to black hands in short order. 
Changes in the racial makeup of urban neighborhoods happened at the same time 
as cash-strapped cities cut back on municipal services and many banks dramatically 
reduced the availability of mortgages and loans for home improvements. Th e creation 
of the white suburbs and the vastly expanded urban black ghettos went hand 
in hand in the 1950s. 
Moving from the South to an unfamiliar North could be painful for African-Americans. 
In Th e Last Train North , Clift on Taulbert described the longing for things left behind: 
Th ere were no Chinaberry trees. No pecan trees.…Never again would I pick 
dew berries or hear the familiar laughter from the fi eld truck. Th is was my 
world now, this strange new family and their cramped quarters over the tiny 
grocery store they grandly called the “confectionary.” 
Nevertheless, they kept coming through the 1940s and 1950s. As a migrant from 
Tennessee to Milwaukee said, “Every train, every bus, they were coming.” 
Many who arrived were disillusioned. When Harvey Clark, who originally hailed 
from Mississippi, tried to move his family from a crowded apartment in South 
Chicago to a larger one just across the city line in Cicero, he was greeted by a mob 
and a police chief who told him to “Get out of Cicero.” Th e chief told the agent who 
arranged the apartment, “Don’t come back in town, or you’ll get a bullet through

you.” The white mayor of Dearborn, Michigan, told Alabama’s 
Montgomery Advertiser that “Negroes can’t get in here. Every time 
we hear of a Negro moving in, we respond quicker than you do 
to a fi re.” As Detroit became a majority black city, its suburb of 
Dearborn remained 99 percent white. 
Black migrants also found new freedoms and opportunities in 
the North. Ida Mae Brandon Gladney, who had never been able 
to vote in Mississippi, cast her fi rst vote for Franklin Roosevelt in 
Chicago in 1940. (Th e black vote in Chicago carried the state of 
Illinois and, thus, the Electoral College for Roosevelt in that election.) 
Robert Joseph Pershing Foster, a physician in Louisiana, 
established a new practice in the rapidly expanding black community 
of Los Angeles in 1954 and 1955. Th e several million other 
people making the move from the states of the Old Confederacy to 
New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and a hundred other cities in the 
North and West each had his or her own tale of the transformations 
taking place in every region of the country. 
Latino Migrations from Puerto Rico and Mexico 
While the great migration of African-Americans from the rural 
South to the urban North and West was occurring, migrations of 
Latino people were happening at the same time. Th e United States 
had won control of Puerto Rico in 1898, and Puerto Ricans had long been American 
citizens. Aft er World War II, more of these Spanish-speaking citizens began moving 
from Puerto Rico to the U.S. mainland, especially New York City. East Harlem, long 
an Italian neighborhood in New York City, quickly became mostly Puerto Rican. Piri 
Th omas was born in New York in 1928 and described the racial discrimination faced 
by a young adult in Spanish Harlem in the 1950s in his 1967 memoir aptly named 
Down Th ese Mean Streets. 
In addition, the U.S. population included about 1.2 million Americans of 
Mexican background, and this group also grew rapidly after World War II. In 
the Southwest, the bracero (helping hands in Spanish) began during World 
War II to allow Mexican farm workers temporary entry into the United States 
to work in the agricultural fields that other Americans had left for war industries 
or for the military. The entry program was expanded after the war, and 
between 1948 and 1964, almost 5 million braceros were brought to the United 
States. Although they were expected to return to Mexico when the work was 
done, not all did, and they, along with others who walked across the hot deserts 
and the border, expanded the country’s Mexican-American population, creating 
a large group, some of whom remained under constant threat of deportation. 
In Southern California, growth led to new militancy in the Mexican-American 
community. In Santa Ana, Mexican-American parents hired an attorney and sued the 
Board of Education over school segregation. In 1946, the courts issued a permanent 
injunction against this segregation, and later, the federal appeals court directed a federal 
grand jury to consider an indictment against the Santa Ana board. 
In Los Angeles, with the largest Mexican-American population, the Community 
Service Organization began to fi ght for political rights in 1947 and was successful in 
electing Edward Roybal to the Los Angeles City Council in 1949, the fi rst time since 
1881 that someone of Mexican descent had served on that body. In 1962, Roybal 
was elected to the U.S. Congress. Other Mexican-American organizations sprang up 
across the southwest, supporting a successful mine workers strike in New Mexico in 
1950–1952 and building a solid base before the civil rights movements of the later 
1950s while also supporting a small but growing middle-class Latino community in 
California and Texas. 
As they had in the 1920s, African-American artists embraced urban life and 
the new growing black communities of the North, few more enthusiastically 
than musicians like Charlie Parker and Miles Davis, shown here performing in 
New York City in 1947.

The United Nations and the New Economic Order 
While Americans were moving around the country, the rest of the planet was also 
in transition. Even before World War II ended, a series of international gatherings 
reshaped the political and economic climate of the coming postwar world. 
THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND AND THE WORLD BANK In 1944, leaders 
in the United States and Britain were determined not to repeat the mistakes of the Treaty 
of Versailles. Among those mistakes, they believed, were the huge reparations imposed 
on the defeated Germany and the failure of the victors to ensure robust economic activity 
aft er the war. 
In early 1944, Roosevelt’s Secretary of the Treasury Henry M. Morgenthau invited 
Great Britain and the Soviet Union to join the United States in establishing a postwar 
economic system. Both agreed. Morgenthau then invited representatives of more than 
40 wartime allies to meet at the Mount Washington Hotel in Bretton Woods, New 
Hampshire, in July 1944. 
Th e resulting Bretton Woods agreement created an International Monetary Fund 
(IMF) for “promoting international monetary cooperation.” Th e purpose of the IMF 
was to maintain exchange rates between diff erent currencies so people could buy and 
sell in diff erent countries without fear that values would fl uctuate wildly (as happened 
in the 1930s), to provide loans to a nation that was having problems balancing payments, 
and to provide technical assistance to banks. Th e U.S. dollar was made the base 
on which all other currencies were calculated (and it remained so until 1971). 
Th e Bretton Woods delegates also created the International Bank for Reconstruction 
Development (better known as the World Bank) to get the world on stable economic 
footing as quickly as possible after the devastation of the war. The World Bank was 
designed to support economic recovery in war-torn Europe and to reduce world poverty, 
especially in Latin America, Africa, and parts of Asia that did not have the economic 
foundation for recovery. Th e fi rst loans from the World Bank were made to war-torn 
France in 1947, and loans were soon extended around the world. 
T HE UNITED NATIONS W hen Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill agreed to 
an Atlantic Charter in August 1941, they called for the “establishment of a wider and 
permanent system of general security” (see Chapter 23 ) . By 1944, however, Roosevelt 
was ready to get more specifi c. He proposed an international body that would include 
every nation but in which the most powerful ones—in his proposal, the United States, 
Britain, the Soviet Union, and China—would serve as the “Four Policemen.” As he told 
reporters in the summer of 1944, if some aggressor “started to run amok,” these policemen 
would be needed to “stop them before they got started.” By 1944, the wartime 
alliance was calling itself the United Nations , and Roosevelt wanted to keep the name. 
Th e United States invited representatives from “the four policemen” to meet at a 
mansion known as Dumbarton Oaks in Washington, DC. In 7 weeks, from August to 
October 1944, Edward R. Stettinius, U.S. undersecretary of state; Andrey Gromyko, 
Soviet ambassador to the United States; and Sir Alexander Cadogan, permanent 
undersecretary in the British Foreign Offi ce, consulting with V.K. Wellington Koo, 
the Chinese ambassador to London—with whom Gromyko refused to meet directly— 
erected the basic structure of what would become the United Nations (UN).They 
agreed that the core of the new organization would be a Security Council made up of 
fi ve permanent members (France was added as a fi ft h member) and other delegates 
serving on a rotating basis. Th e Security Council would have the real power within the 
UN. A majority vote of the Security Council would be suffi cient to authorize military 
force to stop aggression. Everyone also agreed that each of the core members of the 
Security Council should have a veto over any such actions; the United States, Britain, 
and the Soviet Union were not about to allow sanctions of which they did not approve. 
Th e planners also proposed a UN General Assembly that would permit all of the 
nations of the world to debate issues but that, unlike the Security Council, could not

Three years after the United Nations was created, a UN 
Commission on Human Rights, chaired by former First Lady 
Eleanor Roosevelt, proposed a Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights. By 1948, the Cold War between the United States and the 
Soviet Union was fully underway, and many UN meetings were little 
more than shouting matches. Few expected any productive results. 
But Eleanor Roosevelt was able to calm the waters enough to get the 
document approved. The final vote was 48 in favor, zero opposed, 
and 8 abstentions, including the Soviet Union. Roosevelt considered 
the adoption of the declaration to be her most important accomplishment. 
While the Universal Declaration of Human Rights had 
no enforcement mechanism, it set a new standard of international 
behavior against which every nation could be measured. 
PREAMBLE 
Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal 
and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the 
foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world, 
Whereas disregard and contempt for human rights have resulted 
in barbarous acts which have outraged the conscience of mankind, 
and the advent of a world in which human beings shall enjoy freedom 
of speech and belief and freedom from fear and want has 
been proclaimed as the highest aspiration of the common people, 
Whereas it is essential, if man is not to be compelled to have 
recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression, 
that human rights should be protected by the rule of law, 
Whereas it is essential to promote the development of friendly 
relations between nations, 
Whereas the peoples of the United Nations have in the 
Charter reaffirmed their faith in fundamental human rights, in 
the dignity and worth of the human person and in the equal 
rights of men and women and have determined to promote 
social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom, 
Whereas Member States have pledged themselves to 
achieve, in co-operation with the United Nations, the promotion 
of universal respect for and observance of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms, 
Whereas a common understanding of these rights and 
freedoms is of the greatest importance for the full realization of 
this pledge, 
Now, Therefore THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY proclaims THIS 
UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS as a common 
standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations… 
The document then includes a total of 30 articles that elaborate

enforce its resolutions. In addition, they agreed that there should be a secretary with a 
staff . Finally, they agreed that the new body should convene for the fi rst time the following 
spring in San Francisco, California. 
Roosevelt, mindful of Woodrow Wilson’s failure to take Republicans to Versailles, 
appointed a bipartisan delegation to go to San Francisco, including Republican 
Arthur Vandenberg of Michigan, one of the most respected members of the Senate. 
Vandenberg’s support would be crucial, and Roosevelt knew it. 
Two weeks before the San Francisco meeting was to begin, Franklin D. Roosevelt 
died. Moments aft er taking the oath of offi ce, Harry S. Truman made his fi rst presidential 
decision: the conference would go ahead as scheduled on April 25. Some thought 
the San Francisco conference would simply be a celebration of work already done, 
but new tensions, especially between the United States and the Soviet Union, almost 
scuttled the conference. Nevertheless, most Americans wanted the United Nations to 
be successful, and public opinion infl uenced the delegates, especially Vandenberg. On 
June 25, 1945, the delegates unanimously approved the UN Charter. On July 28, the 
U.S. Senate ratifi ed the charter by a vote of 89 to 2. Th e United Nations was launched.

THE COLD WAR BEGINS 
Analyze the coming of the Cold War, tensions with the Soviet Union, and McCarthyism at 
home. 
In 1945, most people in the United States admired the Soviet Union, even if American 
leaders had already become wary of Stalin and his government. Aft er meeting Stalin 
for the fi rst time at Tehran in late 1943, Roosevelt said, “I ‘got along fi ne’ with Marshall 
Stalin.” Privately, however, he confi ded his doubts. 
Th e two nations were allies in World War II. American wartime propaganda talked 
positively about “our valiant allies.” Th e Soviet people had withstood a murderous 
onslaught by Nazi forces and a terrible siege at Stalingrad. Th e Soviet army had done 
most of the fi ghting against Nazi Germany in World War II. Few Americans knew 
much about Stalin’s policies within Russia, including the deadly purges of political 
enemies or the mass starvation that resulted from eff orts toward collectivist Russian 
agriculture in the 1930s. Yet within a year, the Soviet Union and the United States 
were engaged in a Cold War that lasted 40 years, until the dissolution of the Soviet 
Union in the late 1980s. What happened to turn former allies against each other? And 
why did it happen so quickly? 
The Hardening of Positions: Containment, the Truman Doctrine, the 
Marshall Plan, and the Berlin Airlift 
From the beginning of their wartime alliance, the United States and the Soviet 
Union had very different goals in World War II. The Soviets wanted a permanent 
buffer zone between themselves and Germany, and they wanted to ensure that they 
obtained absolute control over the countries of Eastern Europe. Having suffered so 
much from the war, the Soviets were also determined to take all of the machinery, 
munitions, and art they could from Germany. The United States wanted a rapid

post-Nazi German recovery. In 1942, Roosevelt told Soviet Foreign Minister 
V. M. Molotov that, “there might be a proper time” to address the differences in 
war goals between the two nations, but in the midst of the war, FDR said, “the 
present was not the moment.” 
Within weeks of taking the oath of offi ce, President Truman became convinced 
that the Soviets were violating promises they had made to Roosevelt and needed to 
be stopped. When he met with Foreign Minister Molotov for the fi rst time, he was 
ready to show how tough an American president could be. When Molotov began the 
conversation with diplomatic chit chat, Truman immediately accused the Soviets of 
breaking promises they had made to FDR at the Yalta meeting. As Truman continued 
his tirade, Molotov responded, “I have never been talked to like that in my life,” 
to which Truman responded, “Carry out your agreements and you won’t get talked 
to like that.” It was not an auspicious start to a new relationship. Truman later told 
friends, “I gave him the one-two, right to the jaw.” Molotov and Stalin quickly concluded 
that Truman was reversing Roosevelt’s policies, especially when Truman cut 
aid to the Soviet Union, claiming that, with the war in Europe over, they no longer 
needed it. But Stalin did not back down. Indeed, almost immediately after the 
Truman-Molotov meeting, Stalin asserted Communist control over the new governments 
of Poland, Romania, and Bulgaria. 
In spite of Truman’s tough tone with Molotov in April 1945, Truman knew that he 
had a weak hand in dealing with the Soviets. He sent one of Roosevelt’s most trusted 
advisors to Moscow to try to build a better relationship, and then in July for the fi rst— 
and only—time, he met face to face with Stalin in Potsdam, just outside the newly 
conquered Berlin. Truman and Stalin seemed to get on, and aft er the Potsdam meeting, 
Truman wrote, “I can deal with Stalin.” Th e Americans agreed that Stalin had the 
right to dismantle factories in eastern Germany and move them to Russia and could 
arrange the government of Poland as he chose. 
Th ere were many reasons for these concessions. Most important, when the fi ghting 
in Europe ended, the Soviet army was in Eastern Europe and the American army 
was not. Truman knew that the American people had no stomach for maintaining 
an army in Europe aft er the war. Until the last day of the Potsdam meeting, Truman 
was not sure that the atomic bomb would work. Finally, with war still raging in the 
Pacifi c, Truman wanted the Soviets to keep their promise to attack Japan once the war 
in Europe was over. 
In the year that followed the end of the war, however, both sides hardened 
their positions. In February and March 1946, new tensions flared. In a 
speech on February 9, Stalin said that the only key to future world peace was 
for “monopoly capitalism” to be replaced by Communism around the world. 
Supreme Court Justice William Douglas called Stalin’s speech a “Declaration of 
World War III.” 
A week later, George Kennan, a senior diplomat in the American embassy in 
Moscow, sent what came to be known as the “Long Telegram” to the U.S. State 
Department. This widely distributed document called the Soviet government 
an “Oriental despotism” in which Communist ideology was merely a “fig-leaf” 
covering tyranny at home and rapid expansion abroad. Kennan told his State 
Department superiors that the Soviet Union was “a political force committed 
fanatically to the belief that with the United States there can be no permanent 
modus vivendi [accommodation between disputing parties], that it is desirable 
and necessary that the internal harmony of our society be destroyed, the international 
authority of our state be broken.” He suggested that the United States 
should adopt a policy of containment , acknowledging Soviet influence where it 
existed but taking all necessary steps to ensure that the influence did not spread 
into new areas of the globe. Containment of Soviet communism would come to 
define U.S. foreign policy for a long time.

24.3 
Two weeks later, Winston Churchill, no longer in offi ce but still a revered war 
hero, gave a speech as Truman’s guest at Westminster College in Missouri in which 
he said: 
From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic, an iron curtain has 
descended across the continent. From what I have seen of our Russian friends 
and allies during the war, I am convinced that there is nothing they admire so 
much as strength, and there is nothing for which they have less respect than 
weakness, especially military weakness. 
Th e image of an “ iron curtain ” dividing Europe became one of the central images of 
the Cold War. Th e call for military strength to counter Soviet strength became the 
foundation of a massive arms race on both sides of the iron curtain. 
Not everyone in the United States agreed that a Cold War with the Soviet Union was 
inevitable. Th ree senators issued a statement saying, “Mr. Churchill’s proposal would 
cut the throat of the Big Th ree, without which the war could not have been won and 
without which the peace cannot be saved.” Former Vice President Henry Wallace, by 
then secretary of commerce, insisted that it was important for the United States to “allay 
any reasonable Russian grounds for fear, suspicion, and distrust.” Privately, Truman 
called these critics of Churchill’s speech “the American Crackpots Association.” 
As 1946 came to an end, more Americans were coming to the conclusion that Stalin 
was an evil dictator and the Soviet Union could not be trusted. Truman decided that his 
administration needed to speak with a single voice and dropped Wallace and Secretary 
of State James Byrnes from the cabinet, replacing the latter with George Marshall, who 
was U.S. chief of staff during the war. A year later Truman also sponsored a reorganization 
of the nation’s military forces in which the previously separate cabinet-level 
War and Navy departments were merged into a single Department of Defense that was 
responsible for all military matters. Truman was quickly concluding that the end of 
World War II did not mean the end of the need for U.S. military strength. 
Meanwhile, in early 1947, Greece was in the midst of a civil war between its government 
and communist forces, and Turkey was resisting Soviet demands for greater 
control of access to the eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East. Great Britain, 
which had been providing support for both governments, said it could no longer aff ord 
to do so. Truman, Marshall, and Marshall’s deputy, Dean Acheson, agreed that the 
United States needed to step in to take Britain’s place in supporting resistance to communism 
in the region. If the containment policy meant anything, it certainly meant 
stopping Soviet moves into places like Greece and Turkey. The Truman Doctrine 
made it clear that containing communism would be at the bedrock of U.S. foreign 
policy. Needing the support of a reluctant Congress, Truman appeared in person and 
said, “I believe that it must be the policy of the United States to support free peoples 
who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures.” 
In June, the administration announced plans for massive economic aid to 
western Europe. The winter of 1946–47 had been the worst in years. By spring, 
Europe was running dangerously low on coal and food. People were cold, hungry, 
and desperate. Secretary of State Marshall used a Harvard commencement speech to 
tell the world: 
Our policy is directed not against any country or doctrine, but against hunger, 
poverty, desperation, and chaos.…We know that in this trying period, 
between a war that is over and a peace that is not yet secure, the destitute and 
oppressed of the earth look chiefl y to us for sustenance and support until they 
can again face life with self-confi dence and self-reliance. 
Th e speech was partly true. Th e humanitarian goals, a campaign against hunger, poverty 
and desperation, were real. But the Marshall Plan , as it came to be called, was 
also directed against one country and its doctrine. People in the United States and 
the Soviet Union knew that the goal was to stop Soviet expansion in Western Europe.

Congress funded $13.34 billion in U.S. aid for Europe between 1948 and 1952. 
People were fed, economies recovered, and western capitalist democracies were 
established. 
Stalin saw the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan as a direct assault. Some 
Americans, notably the now-out-of-offi ce Henry Wallace, also thought it was a needless 
provocation. Th e Soviets quickly solidifi ed the power of a pro-Soviet regime in 
Hungary and arranged a pro-Soviet coup in Czechoslovakia in February 1948. Th en in 
June 1948, the Soviet Union closed off American, British, and French access to Berlin. 
Before World War II ended, the Soviet Union, Britain, the United States, and France 
had agreed that each of them would assume military authority not only in a diff erent 
quadrant of Germany but also within a diff erent quadrant in the city of Berlin, 
even though Berlin itself was deep inside the Soviet quadrant. Th e result was a divided 
Germany and a divided Berlin, a precarious situation especially for the former capital 
city (see Map 24-2 ). 
Th e Soviets saw Berlin as a useful pressure point in the Cold War. By closing off 
western access to the city, they could challenge the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall 
Plan. When they blocked all rail and highway access to Berlin in the spring of 1948, 
Truman decided to support the city with an airlift . In the days and weeks that followed, 
the Berlin Airlift sent hundreds of U.S. airplanes every day to Templehoff 
Airport in the western sector of Berlin. Th e city was well supplied and West Berlin 
withstood the siege. Eventually in May 1949, the Soviet Union relented and reestablished 
access to Berlin. Nevertheless, by the beginning of 1949, the iron curtain that 
Churchill had described was more fi rmly in place than ever, and the Cold War, which 
had been developing since 1945, was a reality. 
1949—The Soviet Atom Bomb and the Fall of China 
Just as the crisis in Berlin was coming to an end, the U.S. Senate ratifi ed American 
membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), by an 82 to 13 vote in 
July 1949. Fearing a Soviet invasion of western Europe, 12 nations, led by the United 
States and Britain, created the NATO alliance, in which each member agreed to treat 
an attack on any one from any source—though only one source was feared—as an 
attack on all. Th ere would be no repeat by any country of Nazi Germany’s attacks on 
the nations of Europe, one aft er another. Th e NATO treaty was the fi rst time in history 
that the United States agreed to such a peacetime partnership.

MAP 24-3 A Divided Europe. As the Cold War escalated, countries within NATO and those within the 
Warsaw Pact, with few neutral nations, made up the new Europe. 
In 1955, when the Federal Republic of Germany, or West Germany, was created 
out of the merged British, French, and U.S. occupation zones and admitted to NATO, 
the Soviet Union formed the Warsaw Pact—a military alliance in eastern Europe specifi 
cally designed to counter NATO with the same guarantees of mutual assistance for 
its members, all of whom were under tight control by the Soviet Union. NATO and 
the Warsaw Pact would be more powerful entities in the coming decades than the 
United Nations (see Map 24-3 ).

Two further events in the fall of 1949 sped the growth of Cold War sentiment in 
the United States. First, in August, the Russians exploded their own atomic bomb. 
Th en, soon aft er the announcement of Soviet nuclear capacity, the government of the 
U.S. wartime ally Chiang Kai-shek was defeated by Chinese communists. Th e creation 
of the Communist People’s Republic of China under the leadership of Mao Tse-tung 
and the fl ight of Chiang’s government to the island of Taiwan was a huge blow to 
American pride even though the United States continued to recognize the Taiwanbased 
government as the offi cial voice of China until the 1970s. Chiang’s government 
had been an important symbol to Americans since the Japanese invasion of China in 
the 1930s, and the United States had spent almost $3 billion to help Chiang since the 
end of World War II. Americans had tended to ignore the corruption and ineffi ciency 
of Chiang’s Nationalist government. An internal U.S. State Department paper written 
in August 1949 just before the fall of Chiang’s government said, “Th e unfortunate 
but inescapable fact is that the ominous result of the civil war in China was beyond 
the control of the government of the United States.” However, many Americans— 
in Congress, in the media, and around the country—were convinced that the United 
States had somehow “lost China” and that the Truman administration was at fault. It 
was a sour time in a country which was not used to losses. 
The Cold War at Home—Joseph McCarthy and a New Red Scare 
As Americans tried to make sense of the Cold War, the Soviet manufacture of an 
atomic bomb, and the Communist takeover in China, some in Congress and beyond 
looked for internal enemies. Many politicians were worried about maintaining the 
security of the United States, but some in Congress sought political gain by fomenting 
a new Red Scare similar to the one that had followed World War I (see Chapter 21 ) . 
On January 21, 1950, Alger Hiss, a former State Department offi cial who had 
been with FDR at Yalta and who helped organize the United Nations, was accused 
of having been a spy for the Soviets in the 1930s. One week later, Klaus Fuchs, an 
atomic scientist, was arrested in London and accused of turning over nuclear secrets 
to the Soviets. Fuchs implicated several Americans, including David Greenglass, 
Greenglass’s sister Ethel Rosenberg, and her husband Julius Rosenberg. And little 
more than a week aft er the arrest of Fuchs, Wisconsin Senator Joseph McCarthy 
gave a speech in Wheeling, West Virginia, in which he claimed to have a list of 
active Communist Party members who worked for the federal government. People 
began to suspect communist infi ltration everywhere. Th e nation was in for 5 years 
of fear and suspicion. 
Reality was more complex than the picture of widespread subversion implied. 
Although the Communist Party in the United States was tiny, thousands of Americans 
had considered communism as an alternative to the nation’s battered economic system 
in the 1930s. In addition, during World War II, the Soviet Union was the America’s 
close ally in the fi ght against Nazi Germany. Before 1945, no one could have anticipated 
that helping the Soviets would be such a serious crime later in the decade. 
Like many State Department offi cials, Alger Hiss was from the highest social strata, 
making him an ideal choice for those who wanted to whip up class resentment as well 
as anticommunism. When Hiss was accused of passing state secrets to the Soviets, 
he insisted on testifying under oath in front of Congress, a move that opened Hiss 
to a charge of libel, and even though he was never convicted of espionage, he was 
eventually convicted of lying under oath to Congress and served 3 years in prison. 
More recently available documents make it clear that Hiss had, indeed, probably been 
a communist in the 1930s, but when politicians like Republican Representative Karl 
Mundt of South Dakota said that the conviction proved that the United States “had 
been run by New Dealers, Fair Dealers, Misdealers and Hiss dealers” they were lumping 
an awful lot of other people who had never even fl irted with communism in the 
same category. Mundt’s comment did prove that, in many parts of the United States,

deep resentment of the New Deal and of the eastern elite 
was alive and well and could easily be linked with each 
other and both could be linked with fears of the growing 
international infl uence of communism in the late 1940s. 
Greenglass and the Rosenbergs were investigated in 
1950 and charged with being Soviet spies and with passing 
on atomic secrets to the Soviets in 1951. Greenglass 
worked at the top-secret Manhattan Project, and Julius 
Rosenberg was a wartime engineer, and both had access to 
highly secret data. Th ey were also Jewish, and even though 
Americans were horrifi ed by the Holocaust, anti-Semitism 
was alive and well in the United States in 1950. Just as Hiss 
suff ered for his East Coast elite status, Greenglass and the 
Rosenbergs suffered for their Jewish background. In the 
end, Greenglass served a long prison term. Ethel and Julius 
Rosenberg, who always maintained their innocence, were 
executed in 1953, the only Americans ever executed under 
the 1917 Espionage Act. (In the 1990s, when Soviet archives 
were opened and when another one of the accused coconspirators, 
Morton Sobell admitted that he had, indeed, been 
a spy, it seemed clear that at least Julius, if not Ethel, had 
been Soviet spies.) It was also clear that in the atmosphere 
of 1950 and 1951, it was virtually impossible for them to get 
a fair trial. 
Senator Joseph McCarthy was not the fi rst elected offi cial to try to make political 
gains by stirring up the fear of communism (in fact he came late to the process), but 
he stole the leadership from all the others. He had been searching for a new political 
issue on which to build his reelection campaign in Wisconsin, and in February 1950, 
he thought he had found it when he heard the national reaction to a speech in which 
he said, “I have here in my hand a list of 205—a list of names that were made known 
to the Secretary of State as being members of the Community Party who nevertheless 
are still working and shaping policy in the State Department.” 
McCarthy was far more interested in his own fame than in actually fi nding communists. 
His Senate colleagues knew him as a pathological liar who had lied about his 
military service (he said he had fl own 30 combat missions when he had fl own none; his 
limp was not from shrapnel, as he claimed, but from a fall), and he embarrassed them. 
He drank heavily, fanned the fl ames of homophobia, and attacked both Republicans 
and Democrats whom he thought were “soft on communism.” Nevertheless, few 
were willing to challenge McCarthy while the country was caught up in the fear of 
communism. 
McCarthy said, “The government is full of Communists.” He also said that 
Acheson’s predecessor, George Marshall, had “lost” China. For those who believed 
that only a conspiracy could have led to the growth of communist infl uence around 
the world, McCarthy was the perfect voice. In June 1951, he told one audience: 
How can we account for our present situation unless we believe that men high 
in this government are concerting to deliver us to disaster? Th is must be the 
product of a conspiracy, a conspiracy on a scale so immense as to dwarf any 
previous such venture in the history of man. 
Only treason in high places could account for the nation’s troubles as McCarthy 
described them. 
McCarthy never did name the names on his list, and the numbers kept shift ing in 
diff erent speeches, but he ruined careers and frightened many into silence. His popularity 
seemed to protect him. In May 1950, a Gallup poll showed that 84 percent of 
Americans knew who McCarthy was and 39 percent believed that his attacks were

Senator Joseph McCarthy lectured widely on the Communist menace. Although he 
gave few details, he successfully created great fear. In this image, he exhibits a photograph 
that he claims is evidence of communist infi ltration during a Senate investigation

good for the country. Few political leaders were willing to challenge him. However, 
in June 1950, Maine’s Republican Senator Margaret Chase Smith and six colleagues 
issued a “Declaration of Conscience,” saying that McCarthy was using the Senate 
as a “publicity platform for irresponsible sensationalism.” Still he continued for 
4 more years. 
When he became president in 1953, Eisenhower did not challenge McCarthy 
directly, but helped those who wanted to undermine him. In 1954, Edward R. Murrow, 
perhaps the most respected journalist in the country, did an exposé on McCarthy on 
his “See It Now” program on CBS television. Both the Senate declaration and the CBS 
program hurt McCarthy’s reputation, but it was only when McCarthy decided to 
probe for communists in the U.S. Army that he met his match. As the army’s attorney 
Joseph Welch grilled him, McCarthy lashed out at a young attorney who was assisting 
Welch, accusing him of being a Communist because he was a member of the left - 
leaning National Lawyers Guild. Welch exploded, “Until this moment Senator, I think 
I never really gauged your cruelty or your recklessness.” Th e hearing room burst into 
applause. Aft er that, on December 2, 1954, the Senate voted to condemn McCarthy by 
a vote of 67 to 22. He continued to serve out his term until his death in 1957, but he 
was a beaten man and no longer a force in national politics. 
McCarthy was hardly the only leader of the Red Scare of the late 1940s and early 
1950s. J. Edgar Hoover, who had been head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation 
(FBI) since 1924 and a participant in the government’s attack on radicals aft er World 
War I, cultivated a reputation as the nation’s top crime fi ghter, especially aft er FBI 
agents killed John Dillinger, “Public Enemy Number One,” during Prohibition. But 
Hoover also cultivated a role as a leading anti-Communist, seeking to expose what he 
claimed was communist infl uence in the government, universities, religious groups, 
and later civil rights organizations. He collected fi les on hundreds of Americans, from 
members of Congress to union officials. Although President Truman complained 
about Hoover, insisting, “We want no Gestapo or Secret Police,” he did not stop 
Hoover’s search for subversives. 
Other politicians realized that the search for Communists could lead to electoral 
success. The House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) became 
a powerful forum for those who used the fear of communism to pursue other 
agendas. One of its members, John Rankin, a Democrat from Mississippi linked 
communism, Jews, and civil rights workers, saying of the Civil Rights Movement, 
“This is part of the communistic program, laid down by Stalin approximately 
30 years ago. Remember communism is Yiddish. I understand that every member 
of the Politburo around Stalin is either Yiddish or married to one, and that includes 
Stalin himself.” A young Republican Representative from California, Richard M. 
Nixon, used HUAC to build a national reputation, investigating Hiss, looking for 
communists in the government, and extending the search into the entertainment 
industry and education. 
While some in the entertainment world quickly cooperated with HUAC, many 
fought back. Judy Garland, one of the nation’s most popular stars since her childhood 
role in the Wizard of Oz, pleaded, “Before every free conscience in America is subpoenaed, 
please speak up!” Frank Sinatra asked, “Once they get the movies throttled … 
how long will it be before we’re told what we can say and cannot say into the radio 
microphone? If you make a pitch on a nationwide radio network for a square deal for 
the underdog, will they call you a Commie?…Are they going to scare us into silence?” 
Undeterred, HUAC continued with its hearings. Many witnesses refused to testify 
on the Fift h Amendment grounds that they could not be compelled to testify against 
themselves. Ten actors, known as the Hollywood Ten, took the more diffi cult route 
of claiming that the hearings threatened their First Amendment rights of free speech. 
Th e 10 and others were blacklisted and had their careers ruined, in spite of eff orts by 
the Committee for the First Amendment led by Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall, 
Katherine Hepburn, and Danny Kaye to protect them.

Many labor unions purged communist members. Aspiring new leaders used the 
accusation of communist infl uence to push aside older leaders. Th e United Electrical 
Workers union was replaced by a new union of electrical workers because the United 
Electrical was considered to be communist and was expelled by the American 
Federation of Labor. Civil Rights organizations, including the Urban League, the 
Congress of Racial Equality, and the National Association for the Advancement of 
Colored People (NAACP), purged communist members. Many school districts and 
21 states required loyalty oaths from teachers. In 1948, the University of Washington 
fi red three professors when they refused to answer questions about the Communist 
Party. Some 31 professors were ultimately fired from the University of California 
under similar circumstances. And the American Federation of Teachers, the leading 
union of elementary and secondary teachers, voted that communists should not be 
allowed to be members or teach in the nation’s schools. 
In his book, the Unfinished City: New York and the Metropolitan 
Idea, historian Thomas Bender wrote of the radical transformation 
of the arts after World War II, “Intellectual historians 
have failed to grasp the variety of artistic and critical work that 
characterized the 1940s, partly because concerns of the Cold 
War era gave precedence to certain ideological themes and 
political trends.” Bender argues that it is also important to pay 
attention to the “remarkable creativity and critical discourse in 
the fields of painting and sculpture, photography, architecture, 
music, and dance.” 
As Bender observes, while many Americans were focused 
on the Cold War, others were using the arts to ask different 
questions about American life, especially as people came to 
terms with the threat of nuclear disaster after World War II. 
Often, artists, were pointing to the confusions—some said 
pointlessness—of contemporary thinking as much or more 
than they were making overt statements about one political 
ideology or another. 
James Agee, himself a very well-known author, was the film 
critic for the Nation magazine in the late 1940s. In a 1948 review 
he wrote: 
Several of the best people in Hollywood grew, noticeably, during 
their years away at war; the man who grew most impressively, 
I thought, as an artist, as a man, in intelligence, and in 
an ability to put through fine work against difficult odds, was 
[film director] John Huston.…His first movie since the war has 
been a long time coming, but it was certainly worth waiting 
for. The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is…about as near to folk 
art as a highly conscious artist can get.…I doubt we shall ever 
see a film more masculine in style; or a truer movie understanding 
of character and of men. 
As a generation of young men returned from the fighting of 
the war and took up their day-to-day lives in the civilian workforce, 
some worried that perhaps they had left their masculinity 
behind on the battlefields. Artists, like the film director John 
Huston, addressed these fears. While the films of the late 1940s 
and early 1950s were, like all films, meant to entertain, they 
also helped some in the audience think through some of their 
greatest hopes and fears.

In your opinion, what can a period’s art tell us about its 
politics? What sort of political ideas might one see in a an 
abstract painting or a film about masculinity?

Not everyone was caught up in the Red Scare hysteria. Philip Murray, president 
of the Congress of Industrial Organizations, one of the nation’s largest unions, wrote 
to President Truman in 1947 to protest that government policy did not ensure due 
process for accused employees. Secretary of the Treasury John Snyder protested the 
government’s Loyalty Review Board in 1948. 
George Kennan, who had played an important role in launching the Cold War, 
added a somber note in his Memoirs: “What the phenomenon of McCarthyism did… 
was to implant in my consciousness a lasting doubt as to the adequacy of our political 
system.…I could never recapture aft er these experiences of the 1940s and 1950s, quite 
the same faith in the American system of government and in traditional American 
outlooks that I had, despite all the discouragements of offi cial life, before that time.” 
Not everyone shared Kennan’s pessimism, but many felt that American democracy 
itself had been wounded by the tactics of people like McCarthy. 
War in Korea 
On June 25, 1950, to the surprise of U.S. leaders, the army of North Korea attacked 
South Korea. Korea was a part of the world to which U.S. planners had paid very little 
attention. But it was the place where the Cold War turned very hot. 
With the Japanese defeat in 1945, the victorious allies determined to honor Korean 
hopes for independence. U.S. military authorities used the same formula as they had 
for Germany: a divided military occupation that was meant to be temporary. Military 
planners agreed that the Soviet army would occupy Korea north of the 38th parallel 
(North Korea) and that U.S. forces would occupy the southern half of the peninsula, 
including the old capital of Seoul (South Korea), until a permanent plan for national 
unifi cation could be achieved. It would be a long wait. 
The United States backed a new government led by the 75-year-old Syngman 
Rhee, who was conservative, charming, fi ercely independent, as well as corrupt and 
dictatorial. The Soviets backed an even more dictatorial 31-year-old communist, 
Kim Il-Sung. Both Rhee and Kim were committed to Korean unifi cation, but on very 
diff erent terms. Between the end of World War II and 1950, constant clashes between 
the two governments cost perhaps 100,000 Koreans their lives. 
Then in 1949 and 1950, a crisis developed. In 1949, the Soviet delegate to the 
United Nations, Jacob Malik, began boycotting the UN Security Council because 
that body continued to give the Nationalist Chinese government of Chiang Kai-shek 
the UN vote even though the Communist government ruled mainland China. Th e 
protest meant that the Soviet Union could not veto Security Council resolutions at a 
crucial moment. 
At the same time, the Truman administration, worried that the United States 
was spread too thin, and seeing Korea as of only marginal signifi cance, withdrew the 
U.S. military, leaving Rhee’s government on its own. A year later in 1950, in a speech 
he later regretted, Secretary of State Dean Acheson described the U.S. “defensive 
perimeter” in Asia in a way that did not include either Korea or Taiwan. Stalin and the 
North Korean dictator Kim Il-Sung assumed that the United States was not prepared 
to defend South Korea. Kim pressed Stalin to approve an attack and Stalin agreed, 
though he warned Kim, “[I]f you get kicked in the teeth, I shall not lift a fi nger.” It was 
all the permission Kim needed. On June 25, 100,000 North Korean troops, supported 
by tanks, artillery, and planes, invaded the South. 
Th e Communist leaders had misread U.S. intentions. Truman viewed the Korean 
invasion through the prism of British and French inaction in the face of Nazism. He 
was determined to maintain the Truman Doctrine of containment of communism 
anywhere in the world. With the Soviets absent, Acheson appealed to the United 
Nations Security Council and got a unanimous vote in favor of UN action to stop the 
North Koreans. Th e Korean War was called a UN police action, although nearly all of 
the fi ghting was done by U.S. and Korean troops.

24.3 
Public opinion polls showed solid support for American action, and people 
as diverse as Republican Governor of New York Th omas Dewey and liberal Henry 
Wallace (both of whom had run against Truman in the 1948 presidential election) 
supported Truman. Congress appropriated $10 billion. 
Truman ordered General Douglas MacArthur, then commander of U.S. troops occupying 
Japan, to take command in Korea, and troops were rushed to Korea. Meanwhile, 
the North Koreans kept coming. By September, 3 months aft er the war began, U.S. and 
South Korean forces controlled only a small section of southeast Korea around the port 
of Pusan, known as the Pusan perimeter. Slowly, however, the U.S. forces were built up 
and supplies brought into Korea. American planes bombed North Korean troops heavily. 
Th e bombing wreaked havoc on Communist supply lines but also destroyed rice 
fi elds. Perhaps half the invading North Korean army were killed or wounded in the fi rst 
2 months of the war, and most of the North Korean tanks were disabled. Two to three 
million Korean civilians, 10 percent of the prewar population of Korea, died during the 
war either from bombing or from starvation because of lost rice crops. 
In September 1950, under MacArthur’s command, the U.S. and UN forces made 
a surprise amphibious landing at Inchon, on the west coast of Korea close to the 
38th parallel. Th e Communist forces were cut off from their supplies and captured 
or forced to retreat. Th e tide of war suddenly turned, and in less than a month, the 
Americans advanced from the small perimeter to retake South Korea (see Map 24-4 ). 
For MacArthur, the initial victory was only the beginning. He insisted, and Truman 
agreed, that the moment had come to unify the whole Korean peninsula under Syngman 
Rhee. The UN, with the Soviets still boycotting, agreed and MacArthur’s forces began 
moving north, closer to the Chinese border at the Yalu River. MacArthur was confi dent 
that he could win the war and be home by December. When Truman asked about the 
chance of a Chinese intervention, Mac Arthur responded, “Very little.” He was wrong. 
By late November, as MacArthur’s army continued north, 
a huge Chinese army attacked them. “Th e Chinese have come 
in with both feet,” Truman said. Th is time it was the Americans 
that had long drawn-out supply lines. Th ey were ill prepared for 
the freezing cold of a Korean winter. Th e Chinese wore warm 
padded clothing, had fought for years in similar territory, and 
were adept at terrifying hand-to-hand night fighting when 
American planes and troops could not see them. Th e fi ghting 
in November and December of 1950 was brutal. Soldiers were 
killed as they slept or froze in the winter cold. The retreats 
were frightful. Th e U.S. Army Seventh Infantry Division lost 
5,000 troops, one third of its force, in a 3-day retreat over 
mountainous roads as the Chinese attacked from every angle. 
By January 1951, the line dividing the two armies was well south 
of the 38th parallel. Th e war settled into a bloody stalemate. 
For Truman, the defeats in Korea at the end of 1950 were a 
diplomatic and a political disaster. Republicans now saw him as 
weak. Some urged the use of atomic weapons on China. General 
MacArthur, whom Truman despised, had strong Republican 
support. (MacArthur’s fellow senior officers had their own 
opinions. When General Eisenhower was asked if he had met 
MacArthur he responded, “Not only have I met him.…I studied 
dramatics under him.”) In early 1951, MacArthur bypassed 
Truman and tried to get congressional support for a wider war. 
Truman had had enough. With support from the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff , he fi red MacArthur, who had been a hero to many. Army 
Chief of Staff General Omar Bradley was more concerned with 
Europe and fearful of a land war in Asia. Bradley said Korea 
was the “wrong war, at the wrong place, at the wrong time, and

with the wrong enemy.” Th e new commander in Korea, General Matthew Ridgway, 
stabilized the defense lines and arranged better support and supplies for the troops. 
The Chinese and American governments became resigned to a partial victory. 
Neither wanted a larger war, no matter what the two Korean governments thought. 
Battles for places the American troops called “Heartbreak Ridge,” or “No-Name 
Ridge,” described how those on the ground thought about what they were doing. 
Armistice negotiations began in the summer of 1951, but stalled over the fact that 
many Chinese and North Korean prisoners did not want to be returned home. It 
would take 2 more years, and the election of a new U.S. president, before the fi nal 
armistice was signed in July 1953. More than 36,000 Americans were killed in the 
war, many times more Korean and Chinese troops, and probably 3 million Korean 
civilians. Th e fi nal armistice line was not far from where the prewar line had been near 
Panmunjom. Sixty years later, Korea is still a tense and divided place.

POLITICS, 1948 AND 1952 
Explain political developments that led to the elections of Truman and then Eisenhower as 
Cold War era presidents. 
When Harry Truman became president in April 1945, few Americans knew much 
about him. Many expected Truman to merely serve out the term to which Roosevelt 
had been elected. Truman decided otherwise, but he had a lot of time and a lot of 
responsibility to manage before any thought of reelection loomed. 
Riding A Tiger—Truman’s First Term 
As war and foreign policy dominated Truman’s fi rst months in offi ce, Truman said 
he felt like he was riding a tiger. Th e liberal wing of the Democratic Party included 
New Deal activists such as Secretary of Commerce Henry Wallace and Secretary of the 
Interior Harold Ickes who never trusted Truman, viewing him as a product of Missouri 
machine politics who had been forced on FDR by the conservative wing of the party. 
Truman reciprocated the distrust. Looking ahead to the postwar world, Truman told 
Clark Cliff ord, one of his key advisors, “I don’t want any experiments. Th e American 
people have been through a lot of experiments, and they want a rest from experiments.” 
But Truman was not proposing any sort of Warren Harding “normalcy.” 
On September 6, 1945, just 4 days aft er the Japanese surrender, Truman proposed 
legislation that would implement FDR’s Economic Bill of Rights, expanding the federal 
role in public housing, public utilities, job creation, and national health, increasing 
the minimum wage, off ering Social Security benefi ts to more people, while also 
making the Fair Employment Practices Commission permanent. It was a sweeping 
agenda, delighting liberals and dismaying conservatives. Southern segregationists fi libustered 
the fair employment bill that would have continued FDR’s executive order, 
ensuring that employers with federal contracts could not discriminate among employees 
on the basis of race, and kept it from reaching a vote. Other bills were watered 
down by Congress. Congress turned Truman’s eff ort to launch a national system of 
health insurance into the Hill-Burton Act that benefi tted doctors and hospitals and 
private medical insurers, but did not guarantee health insurance. 
While there was Democratic as well as Republican opposition to Truman’s domestic 
agenda, the president’s single most powerful opponent was Ohio Senator Robert 
Taft , the son of the former president, known to many as “Mr. Republican.” Taft not 
only opposed Truman’s agenda but also pushed legislation that reduced taxes, forcing 
cuts in government programs, and persuaded Congress in 1947, over Truman’s veto, 
to pass the Taft -Hartley Act that lift ed many of the protections organized labor had 
enjoyed since the passage of the Wagner Act in the 1930s. 
Taft was not alone. Th e Republican Party was strong following World War II. As 
Truman understood, many people in the United States were tired of experiments, just as 
aft er World War I, many Americans simply wanted to be left alone. In the 1946 midterm 
elections, Republicans took control of both houses of Congress. But Harry Truman was 
a fi ghter, more of a fi ghter than some expected. His goal was to win a full term in his own 
right and elect a Democratic Congress in 1948, goals many thought unrealistic in 1946. 
The 1948 Election—A Four-Way Contest 
In planning his campaign for 1948, Truman sought to maintain the New Deal coalition 
that had elected Roosevelt four times, and even sought to expand it. He wanted 
to have a large plurality among white blue-collar workers, immigrant groups, farmers, 
and poor people. He made special eff orts to court African-Americans and Jews. In 
1946, he appointed a President’s Committee on Civil Rights and its report, released 
in October 1947, led him to propose an antilynching law, a permanent fair employment 
commission, and laws against poll taxes and discrimination in transportation.

24.1 
When the Republican Congress failed to pass these and other pieces of legislation, 
Truman called them “the do-nothing Congress.” Under pressure from civil rights leaders, 
Truman overruled the objections of some of the nation’s highest-ranking military 
offi cers and ordered the desegregation of the nation’s armed forces in 1948. It would 
take several years before the last segregated regiments were phased out, but the process 
was underway for a dramatic change from the segregated military of World War II. 
Truman also favored the establishment of an independent state of Israel. On this 
issue, there was deep disagreement within the administration. Secretary of State 
Marshall threatened to resign if the United States gave support to Israel, and most leaders 
of the State, Army, and Navy departments opposed recognizing the new nation. Th ey 
feared that the United States would permanently alienate the Arab world, jeopardize the 
smooth fl ow of oil to the United States and Europe, and create a situation that would 
remain tense and untenable. Th ose on the White House staff tended to support creation 
of a Jewish state in the Middle East. Truman’s own reading about the Holocaust and 
Middle Eastern history led him to support Israel. He got—and occasionally resented— 
considerable pressure from American Zionists. Th irty-three state legislatures passed resolutions 
favoring the establishment of a Jewish state. Truman responded to one anxious 
State Department offi cial, “I have to answer to hundreds of thousands who are anxious 
for the success of Zionism. I do not have hundreds of thousands of Arabs among my 
constituents.” On May 14, as the last British forces left Palestine, Zionists proclaimed 
the independent state of Israel. At Truman’s direction, the United States immediately 
recognized the new government. To the surprise of many, Israel was able to defend itself 
successfully against an Arab attack and secure its borders and its existence. 
Truman’s policies from fair employment to his support for Israel also had an impact 
on American voters. While many African-Americans were moving into the Democratic 
Party and most Jewish voters were prepared to support Truman after his May 1948 
decisions, the road to nomination and election that year was not easy. Many New Dealers 
in the Democratic Party still hoped for a more liberal or a more popular candidate. 
When it became clear that Truman would win the nomination—and invite Senate 
leader Alben Barkley to be his running mate—Henry Wallace, former vice president 
and commerce secretary, bolted and set up the Progressive Party to defeat Truman, 
end the Cold War, and return the country to what he saw as the Roosevelt legacy. 
Then, when Truman supported a convention platform plank supporting civil 
rights, introduced by Minnesota Senator Hubert Humphrey at the Democratic convention, 
35 delegates from Alabama and Mississippi walked out of the convention waving 
Confederate fl ags and proceeded to nominate South Carolina’s governor and future senator 
J. Strom Th urmond to run against Truman. Th ese “Dixiecrats” were a serious threat 
to a party that always counted on the “solid South” to ensure national electoral victories. 
Th e Republicans, sensing that this was their year, especially with the divisions in 
the Democrat ranks, nominated Governor Th omas E. Dewey of New York, the 1944 
standard bearer, with California Governor Earl Warren as his running mate. Th e team 
seemed to have everything going for it and ran a cautious campaign designed to avoid 
mistakes. Unfortunately for the Republicans, they were too cautious and Dewey was 
too stiff . Alice Longworth, Th eodore Roosevelt’s daughter, called him, “the little man 
on the wedding cake.” Th e Wallace campaign never took off and gained little support 
though it may have denied Truman the majority in a few crucial states, especially New 
York. Th e Th urmond campaign got virtually no support outside of the Deep South 
though it did carry the electoral votes of four states—Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, 
and South Carolina. Truman waged a very tough and spirited campaign against the 
“do-nothing Congress” and the “Wall Street reactionaries.” As he campaigned, people 
started yelling, “Give ‘em hell, Harry!” He had solid support from organized labor and 
farmers and held most of the New Deal coalition together. Still, the Republicans, led 
by Dewey, were confi dent of victory. But when the votes were counted, Truman won, 
receiving 24,179,345 votes to Dewey’s 21,991,291, and 303 electoral votes to Dewey’s 
189. Th urmond won 39 electoral votes. Wallace none.

24.2 
As he began his new term in January 1949, Truman called his 
agenda the Fair Deal . Th e Truman Fair Deal included repeal of the 
Taft-Hartley Act, support for family farmers, a more progressive 
income tax, federal aid to education, an increase in the minimum 
wage, national medical insurance as well as another try to broadening 
Social Security, and expanded civil rights. In his inaugural address, 
Truman also called for more U.S. technical assistance to developing 
countries. Technical assistance became known as Point Four because 
it was the fourth point in Truman’s speech. 
Even though the Democrats controlled both houses of Congress 
in 1949, virtually none of the Fair Deal legislation passed. Southern 
Democrats made sure there was no movement on civil rights, organized 
labor did not have enough support to overturn the Taft -Hartley 
Act, urban representatives saw little value in spending federal tax 
money on farmers, and the American Medical Association made sure 
that there was no national system of medical insurance such as most 
western European countries adopted aft er World War II. Point Four 
foreign aid passed, but the appropriations were small and the resulting 
technical assistance generally insignificant. Much of Truman’s 
second term was focused on the war in Korea—which the Congress was willing to 
fund—and the ongoing Red Scare, which Truman did little to oppose. 
A War Hero Becomes President 
In a belated slap at Franklin Roosevelt, the Republican Congress passed the 22nd 
Amendment to the Constitution prohibiting any president from serving more than two 
terms, and a majority of states ratifi ed the amendment. Th e amendment did not apply 
to the sitting president, and Truman considered seeking a third term. When he was 
defeated in the fi rst primaries by Estes Kefauver, a crusading senator from Tennessee, 
however, Truman decided that two terms was enough and dropped out of the race. In 
spite of his spirited come-from-behind race in 1948 and his later reputation as a tough 
decision maker, Truman was not a widely popular president. 
Th e most popular person in the United States in the early 1950s was Dwight David 
Eisenhower, known to everyone as Ike. Born in 1890 and raised in Abilene, Kansas 
by pacifi st parents, Eisenhower had attended West Point, seeing it as a free education 
for a career in engineering. Instead, he became a long-term offi cer in the peacetime 
army between the wars, moving slowly through the ranks. He was still a colonel when 
World War II began, but was then promoted rapidly and commanded the Allied force 
that defeated Nazi Germany. He probably could have had the presidential nomination 
of either party in 1948 but opted to become president of Columbia University 
and then commander of NATO forces in Europe in 1951. He managed to convey a 
disinterested, “above the fray” persona. Some who knew him better saw another side. 
General George Patton said, “Ike wants to be President so badly you can taste it.” 
While Eisenhower had served as a senior military commander under Democrats— 
Roosevelt and Truman—and tended to agree with the anti-Communist wing of the 
Democratic Party on foreign policy matters, he was a fiscal conservative, and the 
New Deal and Fair Deal programs off ended his sense of the proper role of the federal 
government. If he was going to run, it would be as a Republican. Liberals within the 
Republican Party, including the 1944 and 1948 standard bearer Th omas Dewey and 
Massachusetts Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, were desperate to fi nd an “internationalist” 
candidate who could stop the Republican front-runner, Senator Taft , an isolationist 
in foreign policy and a conservative on domestic issues. Th ey courted Eisenhower 
who remained coy. However, primary voters made it clear that they preferred Ike to 
Taft : Ike defeated Taft 46,661 to 35,838 in the March New Hampshire primary even 
though he was still at NATO headquarters in Europe and did not campaign. Aft er 
Fair Deal 
The name President Harry Truman gave to his 
policies to continue and extend many of the 
New Deal’s domestic policies. 
Many were confi dent of a Republican victory in the 1948 election, 
including the editors of the Chicago Tribune, who published this erroneous 
early edition over which the eventual winner, Harry S. Truman, 
delighted to gloat.

that primary, the momentum was hard to stop and Eisenhower was nominated by the 
Republicans in the summer of 1952—a bitter loss for Taft and his supporters. 
Eisenhower asked California Senator Richard M. Nixon to be his running mate. 
Although the two were not close, and never were, Nixon brought balance to the ticket. 
Ike almost dumped Nixon at one point in the campaign because of charges that Nixon 
had a private, campaign fund donated by wealthy Californians. Nixon gave what 
became known as his “Checkers” television speech for its maudlin promise to keep 
the family dog, named Checkers, even though the dog had been a gift . Th e speech was 
a success, and Nixon stayed on the ticket. For the rest of his career, even aft er his own 
presidency, Nixon celebrated the day of the speech. At the age of 38, Nixon was considered 
young while Ike at 62 was considered old. Nixon had made his name with his 
search for Communists when he was a member of the House Un-American Activities 
Committee. In addition, he was from the West Coast while Ike’s strongest support 
was in the East. 
Th e Democrats nominated Illinois Governor Adlai Stevenson. Like Eisenhower, 
Stevenson was a strong Cold Warrior and a known internationalist who had been one 
of the founders of the United Nations. He had a reputation as an honest politician in 
a state where Democrats were oft en corrupt. He was more conservative than Truman 
on most domestic issues, especially race, and he selected Alabama Senator John 
Sparkman as his running mate, in part to ensure that there would be no Dixiecrat 
walkout in 1952. Stevenson was also very popular with many liberals, mostly because 
of his intelligence and wit. One said that his speeches were “simply gems of wisdom 
and wit and sense.” Unfortunately for Stevenson’s vote-getting, this skill mattered 
more to the party’s intellectual leaders than to many in the working class-black-urban 
coalition that had been key to the election of Roosevelt and Truman. 
Th e campaign was the fi rst in which television played a major role. Th e Republicans 
made eff ective use of short TV spots that carried brief comments by Ike along with 
his famous smile. Ike also promised a nation that was desperately tired of the war, “I 
shall go to Korea,” though it was unclear what he would do there. In November, Ike 
won 55 percent of the vote and carried the electoral college 442 to 89, winning even 
Florida, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia, states that had voted Democrat for decades. 
Th e Republicans won small majorities in Congress. 
Eisenhower fulfi lled his campaign promise and went to Korea. Early in his term, he 
was able to conclude the peace treaty that had eluded Truman. Korea remained divided, 
but the confl ict ended. Ike intended to create what he called “Modern Republicanism.” 
He was a determined internationalist who kept the United States active in the UN and 
NATO. Under Ike, there would be no return to 1920s-style isolationism. He was determined 
to balance the federal budget and not likely to launch major new programs, but 
not roll back the major New Deal initiatives either. He once said, “Should any political 
party attempt to abolish social security, unemployment insurance, and eliminate labor 
laws and farm programs, you would not hear of that party again in our political history.” 
He dismissed the conservative wing of the Republican Party, saying of the conservative 
California Senator William Knowland, “In his case, there seems to be no fi nal answer to 
the question, ‘How stupid can you get?’” 
With Eisenhower’s election, a new Republican administration was prepared to 
maintain many of the New Deal’s domestic policies and Truman’s Cold War internationalism. 
Individuals changed, but surprisingly little policy changed aft er the inauguration. 
Nevertheless, as the Great Depression and World War II receded and a new 
generation grew up with no memory of that diffi cult past, and as many Americans 
experienced unprecedented prosperity, the culture began to change. Th e 1950s were 
staid to some, surprisingly novel to others, and full of surprises for most.

CONCLUSION 
The experience of World War II had a profound effect on American culture in the 
decade that followed the war. Th e federal government off ered generous benefi ts to 
returning veterans, allowing a whole generation of young men to attend college, to buy 
homes, and to live comfortable middle class lives. Men and women, anxious to leave 
the war behind, married quickly and had children, a lot of children. Th e population 
soared in what was called a baby boom. 
In the postwar era, the living patterns of Americans changed drastically. Many 
middle class white Americans left the cities for homes in newly created suburban communities. 
At the same time, the rate of migration of southern blacks to the urban centers 
of the North exploded. Many black migrants moved into city centers because they 
were excluded from suburban developments. Latinos from Puerto Rico and Mexico 
moved to American cities, notably New York and Los Angeles. 
Th e economic gains achieved during the war continued throughout the postwar 
period, made possible, in part, by the position of the United States as the only remaining 
economic superpower in the world. Consumers, who had more money than ever, 
purchased goods produced by American manufacturers, achieved new levels of economic 
security and affl uence, buying automobiles, televisions, and electric appliances 
in the postwar economy. 
Th e end of the World War II also brought on new attempts at international cooperation. 
In an eff ort to create political and economic stability and a lasting peace, the 
United Nations, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank, were ushered 
into being. 
While enjoying the remarkable prosperity of the postwar era, more and more 
Americans became deeply concerned about the Soviet Union and the spread of communism. 
Th e containment of communism became the bedrock of U.S. foreign policy 
in the Truman administration. By 1952, both the United States and the Soviet Union 
possessed hydrogen bombs, and the possibility of “mutually assured destruction” set 
off a Cold War between the two countries that would last 40 years. In Europe, the 
Cold War was institutionalized in the western-led North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
founded by the United States and Great Britain and the eastern Warsaw Pact led 
by the Soviet Union. America’s uneasy relationship with the Soviet Union resulted 
in a second Red Scare within the United States itself. Fueled by the fi ery rhetoric of 
Senator Joseph McCarthy and others, Americans began to suspect communist infi ltration 
everywhere, and many personal and professional lives were ruined by accusations 
of treason, espionage, and Communist Party membership that oft en had little 
basis in reality. 
In 1950, the American policy of containment was tested when North Korea attacked 
South Korea. Th e United States, with support from the United Nations, took up the 
defense of South Korea even aft er a huge army from Communist China attacked U.S. 
forces in the region. Aft er fi erce fi ghting, the outcome of the war was ambiguous. Th e 
United States and China signed an armistice that left Korea divided much as it had been 
since the end of World War II. With the election of a new president, Dwight Eisenhower, 
in November 1952, the nation that was tired of the war in Korea settled into what many 
hoped would be a new era of peace and prosperity even as they continued to fear the 
Soviet Union and the mushroom cloud of atomic destruction. 
How did the actions of the United States after World War II refl ect its new position 
as a world superpower?

Summary 
Th e transition from war to peace brought new challenges and 
new opportunities. Government investment in science continued 
aft er the war was over and led to important breakthroughs 
in medicine and technology. New technology found its way into 
homes in the form of new consumer products. Pent-up consumer 
demand created huge markets for American manufacturers. 
Th e negative side of scientifi c advance was refl ected in 
the nuclear arms race between the United States and the Soviet 
Union. Aided by the G.I. Bill, returning veterans rushed to 
start new lives and new families. Th e 1950s saw building and 
baby booms. The west and southwest were the fastest growing 
regions in the country. While white Americans moved to 
the suburbs, African-Americans moved from the South to the 
North, pushed by segregation and discrimination and pulled 
by the promise of better economic opportunities. The same 
decades saw signifi cant Latino migration to the United States 
from Mexico and Puerto Rico. New international organizations 
helped establish the importance of the United States in the 
global political and economic order.

THE COLD WAR BEGINS 
Analyze the coming of the Cold War, tensions with the Soviet 
Union, and McCarthyism at home. 
Summary 
Even before World War II was over, tensions emerged between 
the United States and the Soviet Union over war goals and the 
shape of the postwar world. Many in the United States government 
became convinced that the Soviets were bent on rapid 
expansion. In the immediate aftermath of the war, tensions 
focused on the fate of Eastern Europe. Th e Truman Doctrine 
established containment as the foundation of U.S. foreign policy. 
Th e Marshall Plan strengthened the relationship between 
the United States and Western Europe, but it also contributed 
to the deterioration of relations with the Soviet Union. Th e creation 
of NATO, the communist victory in the Chinese civil war, 
and the Soviet acquisition of atomic weapons all contributed to 
the hardening of Cold War divisions. The advent of the Cold 
War led to anticommunist hysteria, similar to the Red Scare that 
followed World War I. Th e McCarthy hearings and the hearings 
of the House Committee on Un-American Activities epitomized 
the rampant fear of communism that characterized the period. 
A brutal war in Korea brought the Cold War to Asia.

Summary 
Truman’s fi rst months in offi ce were dominated by war and foreign

Deal were blocked by Republicans and conservative Democrats. 
In the 1948 election, Truman tried to keep the New Deal coalition

The election turned into a four-man race, featuring Truman, 
Wallace, Dewey, and Thurmond. Despite winning reelection, 
Truman failed to get most of his Fair Deal agenda passed by 
Congress. Eisenhower’s election in 1952 signaled the beginning 
of a new era in American politics.

25.1 
Dwight Eisenhower was the U.S. Supreme Commander in Europe 
when Harry Truman became president in the spring of 1945. In 
that role, he worked for Truman as he had for Roosevelt. But when 
Eisenhower decided to enter the Republican race for the White House and 
attacked Truman and the Democrats during the campaign, the relationship 
between the two men was deeply strained. Between Eisenhower’s election 
victory in November 1952 and inauguration in 1953, the outgoing Truman 
administration had little to do with the new one. Nevertheless, once in 
offi ce, Eisenhower made surprisingly few changes to Truman’s policies. Th e 
Republican Eisenhower ended the war in Korea, mostly with a veiled threat 
to use atomic weapons, and surprisingly, solidifi ed core New Deal policies 
and the Cold War. 
Eisenhower’s was a reassuring presence, and many considered his 
8 years in offi ce to be a time of complacency and stability in national life. 
However, the era was also one of extraordinary change. New technology, 
most of all television, changed the culture. Dissent from the dominant complacency 
was found in many places, most of all among the young and the 
more than 10 percent of Americans who were of African origin. Th e modern 
Civil Rights Movement began in the 1950s. Th e perceived stability and 
the many real changes of the 1950s are the focus of this chapter.

EISENHOWER’S AMERICA, AMERICA’S WORLD 
Explain the continuation of the Cold War under a new Republican administration. 
Th e successful test of a U.S. hydrogen bomb in November 1952, followed only months 
later by the successful test of a similar bomb by the Soviet Union (United Soviet 
Socialist Republic, or U.S.S.R.) in August 1953, meant that Eisenhower and every 
subsequent president would govern in a world that was quite diff erent from any of 
their predecessors. While alliances like the U.S.-led NATO and the Soviet-led Warsaw 
Pact might position ground forces, the reality was that each of the superpowers had 
the capacity to destroy the other in a single stroke, and probably, for the fi rst time in 
history, to destroy all life on earth. Th e Cold War between the United States and the 
Soviet Union was a daunting reality for every person on the planet in the 1950s and for 
a long time thereaft er. 
Foreign Policy in a World of Hydrogen Bombs 
Early in his fi rst term, Eisenhower lamented, “We are in an armaments race. Where 
will it lead us? At worst, to atomic warfare. At best to robbing every people and 
nation on earth of the fruits of their own toil.” Eisenhower tried to diff use the situation. 
In December 1953, he proposed an “Atoms for Peace” plan to the United 
Nations by which the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom, 
would turn over some of their nuclear material to an international agency for peaceful 
use. However, little came of the plan. Th e distrust between the two superpowers 
was too great. Infl uential political leaders in the United States would not support a 
reduction in defense spending because they worried about the Soviets and because 
military spending—a total of more than $350 billion during Eisenhower’s two 
terms—was key to defense industries and jobs in almost every congressional district 
in the country. So the United States and the Soviets continued to build. Th e United 
States tested 203 nuclear weapons in the Pacifi c and at Nevada test sites, exposing 
some 200,000 civilians and soldiers to radiation and even more people to the radioactive 
fallout in more distant areas. Th e Soviets conducted at least as many tests if 
not more. 
Along with his Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, Eisenhower tried to craft 
a foreign policy that kept the fi nancial costs of the Cold War to a minimum, protected 
U.S. influences in key corners of the globe, and avoided war. This foreign 
policy comprised two key elements. Th e fi rst was a policy of massive retaliation , 
announced by Dulles in January 1954. Th e United States was not prepared to take 
on the cost of keeping troops in every corner of the globe, especially aft er the war 
in Korea. Rather, the United States would try to protect the noncommunist world 
with programs like the Marshall Plan and the Berlin airlift where possible, but also 
with the promise that if the Soviets tried to expand their sphere of infl uence, if they 
were to invade European or other countries allied with the West, then, said Dulles, 
the United States was prepared “to retaliate, instantly, by means and at a place of 
our choosing.” Some called the policy “brinkmanship” since the United States was 
ready to go to the brink of destruction if the Soviets moved outside their sphere of 
infl uence, and the Soviets were being put on notice that the United States was prepared 
to use its H-bombs and use them quickly. Th e Soviets might have had a larger 
army and navy, but the United States had plenty of bombs, Polaris submarines, as 
well as Atlas and Minuteman rockets that could hit the Soviet Union any time and 
any place. From a force of 1,500 nuclear weapons, the U.S. stockpile increased to 
6,000. Relying on those weapons, the country could reduce the size of the military 
and overall military expenditures, keep taxes relatively low, and avoid infl ation yet 
still ensure U.S. power around the globe.

The second element in Eisenhower’s foreign policy depended on secret activities 
organized by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) . During World War II, the 
United States developed the capacity to spy on and disrupt the Axis countries through 
the Offi ce of Strategic Services. At the end of the war, President Truman disbanded 
that offi ce. Two years later, he received congressional authorization to re-create it, 
now as the CIA, to spy and conduct covert operations in foreign countries that the 
United States feared might become communist. 
In the summer of 1953, the CIA organized a coup against the elected Prime 
Minister of Iran, Muhammad Mussadegh, who had nationalized oil interests 
belonging to British companies and who some feared might have communist sympathies. 
With the covert help of the CIA, he was overthrown and replaced with the 
pro- Western Muhammad Reza Shah Pahlevi, who ruled the country for more than 20 
years before being displaced by an anti-U.S. Islamic revolution in the late 1970s. 
Th en in June 1954, the CIA helped overthrow the democratically elected government 
of Jacobo Arbenz Guzman in Guatemala. Arbenz was promoting land reform 
by expropriating land owned by the U.S.-based United Fruit Company. Although 
the Arbenz administration had compensated United Fruit for the land, the company 
was angry and the U.S. government feared a communist movement until CIA operatives, 
working with local insurgents, drove Arbenz from offi ce. Neither action received 
much publicity in the United States, but the not-very-secret U.S. involvement built up 
signifi cant anti-U.S. sentiment in the Middle East and Latin America. Later, in 1958, 
the CIA tried unsuccessfully to overthrow the government of Indonesia. In 1959, it 
played a role in installing a new pro-Western government in Laos. While Eisenhower 
knew of those actions, he may not have known about plans to assassinate the popular 
elected leader of the Congo, Patrice Lumumba (who was killed by dissidents before 
the CIA reached him), and the new leader of Cuba, Fidel Castro. 
Th e Eisenhower administration also found itself caught up in other world crises 
that could not easily be handled by massive retaliation or CIA intervention. Aft er 
World War II, France sought to reclaim control of its former colonies in Indochina, 
but many there wanted independence. In September 1945, with initial support 
from the United States, Ho Chi Minh proclaimed Vietnamese independence using 
words familiar to the Americans, “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all 
men are created equal.” But the French were determined to reclaim Vietnam. Th ey 
installed Bao Dai, the former emperor of Annam, a part of Vietnam, as the leader 
in Vietnam. Ho Chi Minh’s forces attacked the French. Th e United States, fearing 
a communist government under Ho and more worried about alienating France in 
Cold War Europe than events in Asia, sided with the French. By late 1953, the French 
were isolated in a fortifi ed area, Dien Bien Phu, and facing defeat. Some, including 
Vice President Nixon, urged U.S. intervention, even the use of nuclear weapons. 
Eisenhower responded, “You boys must be crazy. We can’t use those awful things 
against Asians for the second time in less than ten years. My God.” Th ere was no U.S. 
intervention at that time. 
When the French were defeated in 1954, an international conference temporarily 
divided Vietnam into North Vietnam, to be led by Ho Chi Minh, and South Vietnam, 
to be led by Bao Dai and a pro-Western nationalist Ngo Dinh Diem. Elections to 
unify the country were scheduled for 1956. When Diem refused to participate in the 
1956 elections, knowing that Ho, a national hero would win, the United States did 
not intervene. Th e United States relied on the South East Asian Treaty Organization 
(SEATO), a much weaker version of NATO that it had helped to create in 1955, to 
keep Communists out of Southeast Asia, but the organization had little eff ect. 
Th e next crisis also occurred in Asia. Chiang Kai-shek’s Nationalist government 
had been defeated on the Chinese mainland in 1949 and was ensconced on heavily 
fortifi ed off shore islands, the largest of which was Taiwan, then known as Formosa. In 
1954, the Communist government of China began shelling two tiny Nationalist-held 
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) 
Established by President Truman and 
expanded by President Eisenhower, the 
CIA was the nation’s spy agency charged 
with keeping tabs on developments in 
other countries and with engaging in secret 
m issions to advance American interests.

islands, Quemoy and Matsu, just off the Chinese coast. Eisenhower wanted to protect 
Chiang’s government, but Quemoy and Matsu were small islands that were much 
closer to mainland China than to Taiwan. Having seen the war in Korea, Eisenhower 
was determined not to fi ght Communist China over Quemoy and Matsu. Eventually, 
both sides tired of the conflict and the islands remained under Nationalist rule. 
Nevertheless, the incident pointed to larger possible threats.

and other allied nations. Both competed for infl uence in the remaining neutral nations, especially in Africa.

Challenges to Maintaining Peace 
In July 1955, Eisenhower met in Geneva with the new Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev, 
and leaders of Britain and France. Th e summit meeting, whose purpose was to reduce 
international tensions, produced a treaty recognizing the independence of Austria, 
which had been jointly occupied by the four powers aft er World War II, much like 
Germany had been. Although, the summit did not accomplish all that Eisenhower 
wished, many were optimistic about a new spirit of coexistence. 
In February 1956, Khrushchev surprised the world with a speech—originally a 
“secret speech” to Soviet leaders only, but word spread quickly—in which he said 
that Stalin had been a tyrant who had infl icted purges, show trials, forced labor, terror, 
and mass executions on his people. Khrushchev declared it was time to begin the 
de-Stalinization of the Soviet Union. Th e speech was a relief to those who saw the 
beginning of a new era in Russia, though devastating to die-hard Communists.

25.1 
Despite these advances, confl icts and diff erences continued to produce tensions, to 
which U.S. leaders were challenged to respond. In October, hostilities fl ared up in the 
Middle East. Gamal Abdel Nasser, the Arab nationalist ruler of Egypt, sought funding 
from both the United States and the Soviet Union to build the Aswan High Dam on 
the upper Nile River to irrigate new areas of Egypt, provide electricity, and promote 
industrialization. His fl irtation with both sides angered both countries, and in 1956, 
Dulles cancelled the U.S. loan. Nasser responded by taking control of the Suez Canal, 
the essential waterway between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea that was owned by 
a British and French canal company and crucial to the fl ow of oil to Europe. Nasser 
said he wanted the revenue from the canal to build his dam, but his actions angered 
and frightened the British and French. 
On October 29, with British and French backing, Israel attacked Egypt. Eisenhower 
was outraged. He sponsored a UN resolution demanding an Israeli withdrawal. It was 
an ironic moment with the United States and the Soviet Union united in opposition to 
Britain, France, and Israel. When the British and French ignored the UN and bombed 
Egypt, Nasser sank ships and blocked the canal. Th e United States condemned the 
British action and threatened to send troops to Egypt. Th e British never expected the 
United States to take a hard line. British Prime Minister Anthony Eden and Ike were 
wartime friends, but the president was furious. A cease fire was arranged, and the 
canal was reopened under Egyptian management. Th e Soviet Union and the United 
States looked good to Arab countries. Israel remained strong. Only Britain and France 
suff ered. Eden resigned as Prime Minister, and neither Britain nor France was again a 
major infl uence in the Middle East. 
In October 1956, in the midst of the Suez crisis, discontent with Soviet rule boiled 
over in Hungary. Khrushchev’s denunciation of Stalin had raised hopes for a more liberal 
policy in Eastern Europe. Th e Soviet government granted some concessions to the 
Hungarians, but when they pressed for more independence, Khrushchev sent 200,000 
troops and 4,000 tanks to Budapest to end the uprising. Some 40,000 Hungarians were 
killed and another 150,000 fl ed the country seeking asylum in the west. Some called 
for American intervention, aft er all, Eisenhower had talked about the liberation of 
“captive peoples,” but the old general understood the military reality that Hungary 
was surrounded by other Communist nations. Most Americans seemed satisfi ed to 
label the uprising as more proof of Soviet tyranny and leave it at that. 
While the Suez crisis and the Hungarian uprising were taking place, the United 
States was in the midst of a presidential election. Th e Democrats again nominated 
Adlai Stevenson. Although Eisenhower had a serious heart attack in 1955 and was hospitalized 
for 6 weeks, he had recovered fully. Th e Republicans again nominated their 
highly popular president and his not-very-popular running mate. Th e Democrats ran 
anti-Nixon television ads that they thought might be more eff ective than any attack 
on Eisenhower. Eisenhower was well liked, the country was at peace, and prosperity 
was evident. Eisenhower won 57 percent of the popular votes, but the outcome rested 
on Eisenhower’s personal popularity; the Democrats carried both houses of Congress. 
Neither the country nor the president expected any major change of course in the 
next 4 years. However, new developments on the international front presented not 
only new crises but also an opportunity unimagined when Ike’s second term began. 
A Small Satellite and a Big Impact 
On October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik , a space satellite. Although 
Sputnik was small, about the size of a large beach ball, and weighed only 184 pounds, 
it was the fi rst orbiting satellite ever launched into space. A month later, a much larger 
Sputnik II was launched, which carried a dog, Laika, as well as scientifi c and medical 
instruments. While the Soviet Union celebrated, Americans panicked. Th e Soviets 
were clearly winning the “space race,” critics said. Democratic Senator Henry Jackson 
of Washington State talked of the “shame and danger” of the moment. G. Mennen

25.1 
25.2 
25.3 
Williams, Michigan’s Democratic governor, wrote of Sputnik, “It’s a Commie sky. And 
Uncle Sam’s asleep.” 
Because of U.S. spy fl ights over the Soviet Union, Eisenhower knew that although 
the Soviets might launch a satellite, the United States was far ahead in missile development. 
However, he could not say so without admitting to the spying, which he did 
not want to do. It was a diffi cult moment for an administration that worried as much 
about national security as they did about a race to space. Nevertheless, two important 
results came from Sputnik and the fears that the satellite induced—a new government 
space agency and improved education. 
In 1958, the administration proposed the creation of the National Aeronautics 
and Space Agency (NASA) and before long, NASA scientists and engineers had 
launched the fi rst U.S. satellite and soon closed the gap with the Soviet Union. Later 
NASA-led eff orts resulted in human fl ight in space, a moon landing, a string of satellites 
that could be used for telecommunications (and spying), and a space shuttle 
that could bring cargo to replacement crews to orbiting space stations. For all of the 
fears of 1957 and 1958, the United States had far greater resources than the Soviets to 
devote to these eff orts once the determination was made to do so. 
The fears that resulted from the Soviet launch of Sputnik also had a major 
impact on American education. Many saw the Soviet advances in space as the 
result of superior Soviet education. Eisenhower proposed the National Defense 
Education Act (NDEA) , which was passed by Congress in September 1958. Aft er 
many failed eff orts to get federal aid for the nation’s schools, funding was approved 
because of Sputnik. Th e NDEA provided funds to improve science education, provided 
scholarships, and created an education division within the National Science 
Foundation. 
Although national worries had led to NDEA and the new curriculum materials 
that resulted, the 1950s had already been a time of considerable advances in education. 
In 1940, less than half (49%) of the nation’s 17-year-olds graduated from 
high school. By 1950, 57.4 percent of 17-year-olds completed high school; in 1960, 
63.4 percent; and in 1970, 75.6 percent graduated. Before 1950, more girls than 
boys had fi nished high school but more males than females went to college. For a 
time aft er that, graduation and college attendance ratios began to even out, though 
imbalance would return later. Although white graduation rates remained far ahead 
of those for African-American and Latino students, many more students of color 
attended and graduated from high school in the 1950s than ever 
before. Given the perceived national need, federal programs 
began to encourage more females to study in the sciences. At the 
college level, the GI Bill had generated a rapid increase in college 
attendance for military veterans, overwhelmingly white men, 
but as the decade went on, more students of all races and genders 
attended college. College faculty in the sciences benefi tted 
from grants for military research, though some worried about the 
impact of these grants. Even before Sputnik was launched, a Time 
magazine article asked, “Is the military about to take over U.S. 
science lock, stock, and barrel, calling the tune for U.S. universities 
and signing up the best scientists for work fundamentally 
aimed at military results?” 
In spite of “mutually assured destruction” and the space race 
with the Soviets, Eisenhower, who had seen more of war than 
most Americans, desperately wanted to find a path to peace, not 
only to avoid the economic costs of war but also to create a lasting 
peace. Although the July 1955 summit conference at Geneva 
had been disappointing, the “ Spirit of Geneva ,” and the commitment 
to coexistence was something on which Eisenhower wanted 
to build, especially in his last years in offi ce. On October 31, 1958, 
National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration (NASA) 
A new government agency created in 1958 in 
response to Sputnik and specifically charged 
with fostering American space efforts; eventually 
led to the first manned moon landing 
and the space shuttle.

Khrushchev that the Cold War might, at the 
least, be limited by their personal engagement

the United States announced that it was suspending nuclear testing in 
the atmosphere. Th e Soviets also suspended their testing. By 1958, atmospheric 
nuclear testing was found to be a health risk to millions around 
the world as well as an unnecessary military provocation, and the cessation 
was important. 
When a new crisis arose over Berlin in early 1959, Eisenhower 
and Khrushchev managed to avoid escalation. Each of the two leaders 
agreed to invite the other to visit his respective country in the next year. 
Khrushchev’s tour of the United States in September 1959 was a major 
success in spite of Khrushchev’s ill-timed boast that “We will bury you.” 
Th e two leaders agreed to another summit in Paris in May 1960. Progress 
seemed to be in the air. 
On May 1, 1960, the progress stopped. A U-2 reconnaissance 
plane—the type that had been providing the kind of information about 
Soviet military capability that Eisenhower had kept secret—was shot 
down by a Soviet rocket as it fl ew 1,300 miles inside Russia. Khrushchev 
announced that the Soviets not only had the wreckage of the U-2—and 
it was no weather plane—but also had captured the pilot, Francis Gary 
Powers, alive and had found both the poison needle with which he 
was supposed to kill himself rather than risk capture and a pistol with 
a silencer that he had been supplied. “Why the silencer?” Khrushchev 
asked, and then answered, “To blow men’s brains out! Th e men who 
supplied him with the silence gun pray in church and call us godless 
atheists!” 
The U-2 incident dominated the Paris summit. Khrushchev insisted that 
Eisenhower condemn the U-2 fl ights and punish those responsible, which Eisenhower 
could not do, though he did agree to suspend the fl ights. Khrushchev withdrew the 
invitation for Eisenhower to visit the Soviet Union. There would be little talk of 
friendly coexistence in the next 2 years. 
From Oldest to Youngest—The Transition to the Next President 
While the administration dealt with the U-2 incident, the United States was in the 
midst of the 1960 presidential election. Eisenhower’s popularity was high, and if the 
Constitution had allowed it and he had wanted it, he could easily have won a third 
term. But the Constitution had been changed and Eisenhower at 70, the oldest serving 
president, had no interest in a third term. 
Th e Republican Party nominated Vice President Richard Nixon as their presidential 
candidate. Th e Democratic race was contested between several candidates, 
including Senators Lyndon B. Johnson of Texas, Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota, 
Stuart Symington of Missouri, and John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts. Many remembered 
the defeat of Al Smith in 1928—the last time a major party had nominated a 
Catholic—and wondered if Kennedy, a Catholic, could be successful. Liberals also 
worried about Kennedy. Eleanor Roosevelt remembered how slow he had been to 
attack McCarthy and how little he had done for civil rights. She preferred Adlai 
Stevenson. But Kennedy had several important strengths. He had extraordinary personal 
charisma, charming most everyone he met. He also had virtually unlimited 
campaign funds because of the wealth of his father, Joseph P. Kennedy, and could 
far outspend his opponents. Under the leadership of his brother Robert Kennedy, he 
had a superb campaign team. He won the Democratic nomination on the fi rst ballot, 
asked Lyndon Johnson to be his running mate, and entered the general election as a 
strong candidate. 
Nixon, having been vice president for two terms, was the better known. For the 
fi rst time in American politics, the two candidates held a series of television debates. 
During the goodwill that emerged between the United States 
and the Soviet Union in 1958 and 1959, Soviet Premier Nikita 
Khrushchev visited the United States and was a hit on tours such 
as this one of an Iowa farm. 

Chapter 25 Complacency and Change 769 
25.3 
25.1 
25.2 
Th ose who listened to the debates on radio thought Nixon had won due 
to the clarity of his argument. For the much larger television audience, 
however, Nixon seemed tired and haggard while Kennedy who arrived 
from California well rested and with a tan seemed at the height of new 
youthful vigor. In response to Kennedy’s charisma, Newsweek reported 
that there were “jumpers” who leapt to see him, “runners” who chased 
his car, and others who simply screamed themselves hoarse. People 
applauded politely for Nixon. 
Although Eisenhower despised the Kennedys, whom he saw as rich, 
ambitious, and unprincipled, his lack of enthusiasm for his vice president 
was hard to hide. When a reporter asked Ike to name a major 
Nixon contribution to the administration, he replied, “If you give me 
a week, I might think of one.” Although he immediately recanted, the 
damage was done. 
During the competitive campaign, Kennedy accused Eisenhower 
of allowing a “missile gap” to develop between the United States and 
the Soviet Union and promised that, if elected, the United States would 
expand its defenses and its missions in space. He also addressed his 
Catholicism in a well-received speech to Protestant clergy in Houston, 
Texas. Late in the campaign, when Martin Luther King, Jr., was arrested 
in Georgia, Nixon tried to intervene quietly, but Kennedy made a very 
public call to King’s wife, Coretta, and Bobby Kennedy made a successful 
request for King’s release. Many blacks, key voters in some states, decided 
to vote Democratic that fall. On election day, with the highest turnout 
since World War II, Kennedy won by one of the smallest margins in history—
49.7 percent to Nixon’s 49.6 percent though he won in the Electoral 
College 303 to 219. 
On inauguration day, January 20, 1961, the youngest person ever elected president 
replaced the oldest serving president. Th e general who had commanded all allied 
troops in Europe in World War II was replaced by a man who had commanded a small 
P.T. (Patrol Torpedo) boat in the Pacifi c and who became a hero when his PT-109 was 
sunk. Th e new president made much of the leadership change, telling the nation, “Let 
the word go forth from this time and place, to friend and foe alike, that the torch has 
been passed to a new generation of Americans.”

Quick Review How did Eisenhower continue fi ghting the Cold War? How were his Cold 
War and domestic policies similar to or different from Truman’s? 
A CULTURE ON THE MOVE 
Explain the impact of cultural and technological changes on the country. 
During and aft er the 1950s, many looked on that era as one of complacency at home 
and trouble abroad. By 1960, however, the United States was a very diff erent place 
at home from what it had been in 1950. During the 1950s, the nation became much 
more prosperous. In 1960, the average family income of $5,620 was 30 percent higher 
than it had been in 1950, and 62 percent of homes were owner occupied—up from 
55 percent in 1950 and 44 percent in 1940. Aft er the end of the Korean War in 1953, 
the decade was one of relative peace for the United States despite confl icts elsewhere. 
But the decade of the 1950s was also, as the writer Morris Dickstein noted, “a fertile 
period, a seedbed of ideas that would burgeon and live in the more activist, less refl ective 
climate that followed.”

The Growing Impact of Television 
In 1948, Wayne Coy, a member of the Federal Communications Commission that 
regulated television and radio, said, “Make no mistake about it, television is here to 
stay. It is a new force unloosed in the land. I believe it is an irresistible force.” From 104 
commercial stations broadcasting to 5 million homes in 1950, television expanded to 
almost 600 stations received in 45,750,000 homes in 1960—almost 80 percent of all of 
U.S. homes. 
Some of the early television programs were impressive. Playhouse 90 , the 
Goodyear Television Playhouse , and the Kraft Television Theater brought serious 
drama to the television screen. Talented young actors, including Grace Kelly, Paul 
Newman, Joanne Woodward, and Eva Marie Saint, were seen by wider audiences 
than ever before. Th e ABC Concert carried weekly concerts by the Chicago Symphony 
Orchestra around the country. 
Television news, though generally limited to a 15-minute program, included 
the Camel News Caravan with John Cameron Swayze and the CBS Television News 
with Douglas Edwards and brought current events into living rooms. Beginning with 
Truman’s 1949 inauguration and Eisenhower’s 1952 campaign commercials, television 
changed politics; people felt a new intimacy with candidates and leaders. Edward 
R. Murrow’s See It Now programs brought investigative journalism to television, 
including coverage of Senator McCarthy’s hearings. 
Lighter entertainment was very successful, too. Radio had been available to many 
since the 1930s, and some programs, like Jack Benny’s comedy routines, shift ed from 
radio to television with little change. Th e long-running I Love Lucy show with Lucille 
Ball and Desi Arnaz was the most popular show on television. Other comedies, especially 
Th e Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet , Father Knows Best , and Leave It to Beaver , 
used humor to reaffi rm the white, middle class, suburban lifestyle in which the wise, 
sometimes befuddled father supported the family while the passive (if sometimes conniving) 
mother stayed home to happily manage the house. 
A middle-class, white family sitting at home and watching The Lone Ranger on television epitomized the 
1950s for some. 

Chapter 25 Complacency and Change 771

As he began his presidency, John F. Kennedy appointed attorney 
and long-time Democratic Party activist Newton N. Minow to 
chair the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Although 
Minow had little background in the media, he and Attorney General 
Robert F. Kennedy had strong opinions about television. In May 
1961, only a few months into his tenure at the FCC, Minow gave this 
controversial speech to the National Association of Broadcasters, 
declaring that television was “a vast wasteland.” While many in the 
television industry strongly disagreed, many critics thought Minow 
was on target. 
Your industry possesses the most powerful voice in America. 
It has an inescapable duty to make that voice ring with intelligence 
and with leadership. In a few years, this exciting industry 
has grown from a novelty to an instrument of overwhelming 
impact on the American people. It should be making ready for 
the kind of leadership that newspapers and magazines assumed 
years ago, to make our people aware of their world.… 
When television is good, nothing—not the theater, not the 
magazines or newspapers—nothing is better. 
But when television is bad, nothing is worse. I invite each of 
you to sit down in front of your television set when your station 
goes on the air and stay there, for a day, without a book, without 
a magazine, without a newspaper, without a profit and loss sheet 
or a rating book to distract you. Keep your eyes glued to that 
set until the station signs off. I can assure you that what you will 
observe is a vast wasteland. 
You will see a procession of game shows, formula comedies 
about totally unbelievable families, blood and thunder, mayhem, 
violence, sadism, murder, western bad men, western good men, 
private eyes, gangsters, more violence, and cartoons. And endlessly, 
commercials—many screaming, cajoling, and offending. 
And most of all, boredom.

Thinking Critically 
1. Documentary Analysis 
In Minow’s view, what was the most important negative 
impact of poor television programming? 
2. Historical Interpretation 
What light does Minow’s speech shed on the nature of the 
growing discontent with mainstream 1950s culture? 
American Voices 
Newton N. Minow, Television and the Public Interest, 1961 
On Th e Ed Sullivan Show , the poker-faced Ed Sullivan introduced Elvis Presley 
(who Sullivan insisted be shown only from the waist up) and, later, Th e Beatles to 
American audiences. Daytime soap operas (their original sponsors were soap companies) 
moved from radio to television, and Guiding Light , Love of Life , and Search for 
Tomorrow provided a dash of scandal to daytime viewers. Families gathered to eat TV 
dinners (fi rst marketed in 1954) on TV trays, rather than around a dining room table, 
to watch Gunsmoke , featuring a stronger and more silent Marshal Dillon than had 
been possible on radio, plus Maverick , and Have Gun—Will Travel , as well as detective 
stories, including Dragnet , 77 Sunset Strip , and Perry Mason . Children’s cartoons 
took over Saturday mornings. Reruns of old movies were shown in the late evening. 
While some of the first programs had a single sponsor—such as the Goodyear 
Television Playhouse , the Kraft Television Theater , and the Camel News Caravan , 
broadcasters quickly discovered that they could make higher profi ts with multiple 
advertisers, and 30-second commercials urged Americans (always seen as white and 
middle class) to “see the USA in your Chevrolet,” or “move up to Chrysler,” and handle 
their indigestion with “Speedy” Alka Seltzer. 
Television was rocked by not only a series of scandals in the late 1950s but also 
signifi cant criticism. Th e most popular quiz show, Th e $64,000 Question , turned out to 
be rigged. Charles Van Doren, a major winner on the show, had been given answers 
in advance. As commercial stations focused on advertising revenue, they became 
increasingly cautious. One advertiser reminded the station owners, “A program that 
displeases any substantial segment of the population is a misuse of the advertising dollar.” 
Since showing Americans in all of their diversity could displease some, television 
became bland. Even President Eisenhower said, “If a citizen has to be bored to death, 
25.1

25.3 
it is cheaper and more comfortable to sit at home and look at television than it is to go 
outside and pay a dollar for a ticket.” It was hardly a ringing endorsement of the new 
medium. Th e Kennedy administration would not be any more positive in its appraisal. 
The Impact of the Automobile 
Automobiles had been invented before 1900, mass-produced in the 1910s, and had a 
signifi cant impact by the 1920s (see Chapter 21 ) . Nevertheless, the automobile, like the 
TV, came to dominate American culture in the 1950s as never before. 
Once wartime shortages ended, the sales of private automobiles grew rapidly. By 
1960, 80 percent of American families owned an automobile (the same percentage as 
owned televisions). Th e total number of cars registered at the end of the decade was 
74 million, almost double the 39 million registered in 1950. In addition, the cars were 
becoming larger, faster, more powerful, and much fl ashier. In an era of cheap gasoline, 
the symbolism of power, sexiness, and speed was far more important than fuel 
effi ciency. 
Automobiles needed support services and infrastructure, most of all, highways. 
By the early 1950s, the American Road Builders Association was able to successfully 
lobby for the creation of the Highway Trust Fund in which all revenue generated from 
automobiles, especially the tax on gasoline, could be used only to build highways with 
the result that, in the United States, funding for road building was ample, though 
funds for mass transit were more scarce. European countries used similar funds not 
only for roads but also for mass-transit, schools, and hospitals. 
President Eisenhower, who remembered a miserable cross-country journey he had 
made as a young army offi cer on the nation’s ill-maintained highways of the 1920s, 
adopted a plan that had been put together during the Truman administration and 
proposed the Interstate Highway Act, which became law in 1956. The act created 
the Interstate Highway System , a numbered network of 41,000 miles of roads from 
Interstate 5 in California, Oregon, and Washington to Interstate 95 that ran from 
Florida to Maine, connected to east-west interstates 70, 80, and 90 as well as feeder 
highways for which the federal government paid 90 percent of the cost (see Map 25-2). 
These highways made travel by car, truck, or bus much easier and cheaper than 
ever before. At the same time, urban, suburban, and rural sprawl was exacerbated. 
Suburban houses sprang up and tight-knit urban communities went into decline. 
Shopping malls replaced Main Street. Mass transit declined. In Los Angeles, what had 
once been the largest electric interurban railway in the world with 1,100 miles of track, 
was replaced with a system of highways using buses produced by General Motors with 
tires from Firestone Rubber. 
New industries sprang up to service the automobile and the highway. Fast-food 
restaurants allowed busy drivers to pick up a meal and keep moving. Medical, legal, 
and insurance services for the victims of traffi c accidents grew. Motels became a new 
place to stay, replacing grand downtown hotels that had catered to those who traveled 
by train or ship. Kemmons Wilson and Wallace E. Johnson opened the fi rst “Holiday 
Inn” in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1952, and by 1960, there were 60,000 motels, many 
belonging to chains like Holiday Inn or Howard Johnson, catering to people who valued 
cleanliness, comfort, and the convenience of being able to drive directly to the 
door of a room. 
Between 1920 and 1950, gasoline service stations off ering fuel and automobile services, 
some in a grand style, became the most widely built new commercial structure 
in the United States. With their signs advertising Mobil, Shell, and Esso (later Exxon), 
they made it possible to keep cars fueled and on the move. Th e gasoline these stations 
pumped also had an impact on U.S. foreign policy as American political leaders 
understood the nation’s love aff air with the automobile and the need to maintain a 
steady supply of cheap gasoline, much of it from the Middle East and Latin American, 
if they were to stay in offi ce.

Congress approved at the urging of President 
Eisenhower in 1956 to improve car and truck

Critics worried about the impact of the automobile on American culture. In Th e City 
in History , Lewis Mumford complained that the automobile “annihilates the city whenever 
it collides with it.” For Mumford, it was the city, not suburban sprawl, that created community. 
Raymond Tucker, mayor of St. Louis also noted, “Th e plain fact of the matter is 
that we just cannot build enough lanes of highways to move all of our people by private 
automobile and create enough parking space to store the cars without completely paving 
over our cities.” Nevertheless, in the 1950s, more Americans agreed with New York’s master 
highway builder Robert Moses, who designed a series of bridges in and around New 
York as well as the Brooklyn Queens Expressway, the Cross Bronx Expressway, and the 
Long Island Expressway, and who kept advocating for more roads even as some protested. 
The Boom of Religion 
In the 1950s, Americans drove to church and watched religious programs on television 
in numbers never seen before. Th e religious boom of the 1950s was both a cultural and 
a spiritual phenomenon. 
For most of the nation’s history, a little over one-third of the people were involved in 
religious activities. However, in the 1950s, that number grew to over two-thirds, and on 
some Sunday mornings, more than half of all of the people in the country were in church. 
Aft er World War II, Americans became active in religious organizations in numbers

never seen before, and their participation kept rising for the next 15 years. Visitors from 
other countries were stunned by the American embrace of religion. In no other country 
was there a similar upsurge, certainly not in war-weary Europe. Americans identifi ed 
with religious communities, built new churches at an astounding rate, especially in the 
new suburbs, and enjoyed songs like “I Believe,” “It’s No Secret What God Can Do,” and 
“Vaya con Dios,” as popular secular music. Historians continue to ask what accounted 
for this upsurge in religious activity. Th e roots of something as elusive as religious faith 
and as hard to discover as social conformity may be impossible to fi nd, but the signs of 
the times that pointed to a more religious culture were numerous. 
No one represented the religious movements of the 1950s more dramatically than 
Billy Graham. Graham was born on a farm near Charlotte, North Carolina, in 1918. In 
1949, he led a revival in Los Angeles that brought him national attention and remained 
the nation’s best known religious leader for the next 50 years. The Billy Graham 
Evangelistic Association had an annual budget of $2 million and a staff of 200 in the 
1950s. It produced books, television programs, radio, and its own fi lms. Most of all, the 
association organized massive religious revivals that were held in football stadiums and 
civic auditoriums around the country. To the frustration of some conservative supporters, 
Graham would not plan a religious crusade, as he called a revival, without the support 
of the local council of churches, which included liberal as well as conservative clergy. 
Graham also refused to hold racially segregated revivals, even in the Deep South. 
Graham was immensely successful in bringing out thousands of people night aft er night. 
At the end of each event, individuals were invited to come forward and make a personal 
confession of faith to counselors who were waiting for them, as the audience sang, “Just as 
I Am Without One Plea.” Although he was a Baptist, Graham did not worry about religious 
denominations and urged the converted to attend any church that appealed to them. 
Graham’s success was such that he also became a religious advisor to several U.S. presidents. 
While Graham was by far the best known and most successful revivalist of the 
1950s, many others, black and white and increasingly Latino evangelists, conducted 
their own religious revivals in churches, tents, and fi elds across the United States. Oral 
Roberts, a Pentecostal Holiness revivalist and faith healer, built up his own media 
empire that rivaled Graham’s. Less emotional versions of religion, including the sermons 
of the Presbyterian minister Peter Marshall, published in 1949 as Mr. Jones Meet 
the Master also attracted a wide audience. 
A Protestant minister within the Reformed Church in America, Norman Vincent 
Peale, took the quest for peace of mind to a wide audience through his books, Guide 
to Confi dent Living published in 1948 and Th e Power of Positive Th inking published in 
1952, which broke all previous records for the sales of a religious book. Peale’s message 
was “believe in yourself” and develop “a humble but reasonable confi dence.” Religious 
groups known as the “mainstream” of American Protestantism—Methodists, Baptists, 
Presbyterians, Congregationalists, and Episcopalians—fl ourished in the 1950s with 
large memberships and with infl uence rivaling any point in their history. Reinhold 
Niebuhr’s book, Moral Man and Immoral Society , challenged religious people to fi nd 
ways to make ethical decisions in a complex world. Both Reinhold Niebuhr and the 
German-born theologian Paul Tillich appeared on the cover of Time magazine. 
In the 1950s, American Catholics were still a minority but were more numerous than 
any single Protestant denomination. As white Catholics moved to new suburban communities, 
Catholic bishops created new parishes where none had been. Some Catholic 
prelates such as New York’s Francis Cardinal Spellman continued to keep their distance 
from Protestants, but others such as Boston’s Richard Cardinal Cushing found ways to 
reach out to non-Catholics while building Catholic churches and parochial schools at 
a furious rate. Th e walls of distrust were still high in the 1950s: parish priests warned 
young people not to date a Protestant, and many Protestants still saw Catholicism as 
inherently foreign and undemocratic. Nevertheless, many of those who sat in the pews 
of Catholic and Protestant churches were ready to ignore the old divides.

Monsignor Fulton J. Sheen became a popular preacher not only at Catholic religious 
gatherings (never called revivals) but also on television. He brought Catholic 
teachings into the mainstream of American culture, and his book Peace of Soul , published 
in 1949, anticipated some of the positive-thinking themes in Peale’s work. 
Sheen restated traditional Catholic beliefs in ways that appealed to a wide audience, 
Catholic and non-Catholic. 
While 66 percent of Americans identifi ed themselves as Protestant and 26 percent 
as Catholic, only 3 percent were Jews, but Jews also participated in the religious 
upsurge of the 1950s. Before World War II, secularism and assimilation seemed to 
go hand in hand among many Jewish immigrants. Although a growing awareness of 
the Holocaust brought despair and cynicism to some, it brought a renewed interest in 
their faith to others. A new generation of leaders like Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel 
spoke of the need to link modern thinking with traditional Jewish practices and inner 
piety. Many American Jews wanted to rediscover their faith. Th e children of parents 
who had argued over politics now argued over theology. Attendance at synagogues 
reached peaks never seen before. Th e Orthodox, Reform, and Conservative branches of 
Judaism all grew. 
African-American communities also had their own revivals of religion, usually 
quite separately from white communities. Th e National Baptist Convention, the 
African Methodist Episcopal, and the African Methodist Episcopal Zion churches, the 
nation’s three largest African-American religious bodies, all grew during the 1950s. 
Black Pentecostalism fl ourished in northern cities as it long had in the rural South. 
Th e Church of God in Christ, founded in the 1890s, saw its largest growth in the 1950s 
and by 1965 had 420,000 members in 4,150 churches. Th e United House of Prayer for 
All People, led by “Sweet Daddy” Grace, promised grace in return for strict obedience 
to the church’s teaching. In addition, Elijah Muhammad built up the Nation of Islam 
from the small Detroit Temple Number One, founded in 1931, to perhaps a community 
of 100,000 members. 
A much smaller number of Americans also looked beyond the bounds of the traditional 
western faiths. Th e inspiration of Mohandas Gandhi in India led some to look 
at Hinduism. From the teachings of the Vedanta Society or the California-based Self- 
Realization Fellowship, some people turned to yoga or transcendental meditation. 
Others were attracted to the Bahá’í movement, an off shoot of Shiite Islam in Iran that 
sought to synthesize the teachings of all world religions. Buddhism remained small in 
the United States in the 1950s, mostly limited to communities of Asian immigrants, 
though in the 1960s that status would change quickly. 
As Americans became more actively engaged in their religious communities, political 
leaders sought to catch up. In the midst of the Cold War, they saw American religious 
sentiment as an important counter to atheistic communism. In 1954, Congress 
voted to add the phrase “one nation under God” to the Pledge of Allegiance to the 
Flag. A year later, Congress added the words “In God We Trust” to American paper 
currency. While some believers and nonbelievers found this public religiosity off ensive, 
most Americans embraced the sort of civic religion embedded in the new pledge 
and coins with enthusiasm. President Eisenhower said, “Our government makes no 
sense unless it is founded on a deeply felt religious faith—and I don’t care what it is.” 
Dissent 
Although the 1950s have been described as a time of conformity, not everyone conformed. 
Born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1897, Dorothy Day joined the Socialist Party and 
later the IWW as a young woman, opposed U.S. entry into World War I, and was arrested 
for picketing the White House as she demanded the vote for women. In the 1920s, she 
lived a bohemian life with poets and communists in New York’s Greenwich Village. Th en 
in 1927, she experienced a dramatic conversion to Catholicism, left the man with whom 
she was living, and was baptized along with her new baby. In the 1930s, along with the 
Nation of Islam 
A religious and political organization 
founded by Elijah Muhammad that mixed 
Muslim religious teachings with a campaign 
for African-American separatism, pride, and 
self-determination.

Catholic mystic Peter Maurin, founded the Civil Catholic Worker Movement and its 
related newspaper, Th e Catholic Worker , which Day edited until her death in 1980. Day 
embraced voluntary poverty, set up the St. Joseph’s House of Hospitality in New York to 
provide food and clothing to those in need, and protested the buildup of nuclear arms 
and the wars in Korea and later Vietnam. Th e Catholic Worker Movement sometimes 
made church offi cials uncomfortable because it represented a voice of dissent within the 
Catholic Church and the larger American culture in the 1950s. 
A Protestant from the rural South, Myles Horton had much in common with 
Dorothy Day. Horton studied with Reinhold Niebuhr and later Jane Addams, joined 
the Socialist Party, picketed for the International Ladies’ Garment Workers’ Union, 
and participated in endless seminars and late night discussions. In 1931, he moved 
back to Tennessee where he opened the Highlander Folk School “to work with people 
from the bottom, who could change society from the bottom.” In the 1930s and 1940s, 
Highlander trained grass-roots leadership for the labor movement, and in the 1950s 
and 1960s, for the Civil Rights Movement. 
Th ese groundbreaking dissidents, however, seemed tame to many compared with 
the infl uence of rock ‘n’ roll, and no rock ‘n’ roll fi gure got more attention, or worried 
more people in the 1950s, than Elvis Presley. Presley grew up poor in Mississippi and 
Tennessee, learning to sing and play a guitar in his Assembly of God congregation. 
Music producer Sam Phillips knew that although many young white Americans loved 
black music, even the best of black entertainers could not break through the culture’s 
rigid color barrier. “If I could fi nd a white man with a Negro sound,” Phillips said, 
“I could make a billion dollars.” With Elvis he came close. 
With Phillips handling the marketing, Elvis Presley became a star. Th e music in 
“Hound Dog” and “Heartbreak Hotel” represented a new amalgam of rhythm and 
blues, jazz, and pop as well as the earlier rock ‘n’ roll of groups like Bill Haley and the 
Comets whose “Rock Around the Clock” sold 16 million records. 
Elvis sold more than his music. His alienated look and his gyrating sexuality connected 
with young audiences who loved what he represented. Critics were appalled. 
25.2 
25.1 
Elvis Presley’s music and performance style captivated fans and frightened more cautious observers but 
transformed rock and roll music in American culture. 

Chapter 25 Complacency and Change 777 
25.3 
One said that his performances were “strip-teases with clothes on…not only suggestive 
but downright obscene.” Exactly that sultry suggestiveness is just what made him so 
popular to a generation tired of conformity. When Elvis appeared on the Ed Sullivan 
Show , 54 million people watched, the largest television audience in history. 
Elvis was the top musical star leading many other musicians such as black rock ‘n’ 
roll artists Chuck Berry, Chubby Checker, and Fats Domino as well as traditional pop 
music and jazz greats, but it was the new rock ‘n’ roll that defi ned the era. Leonard 
Bernstein, one of the great composers of the century, once described Elvis Presley as 
“the greatest cultural force in the 20th century.” 
Even in science, more overt attention to human sexuality challenged traditional 
norms in the 1950s. Alfred Kinsey, the Indiana University researcher whose book, 
Sexual Behavior in the Human Male, had produced an outcry in 1948, published 
Sexual Behavior in the Human Female in 1953, which though long and full of dry 
scientifi c data, sold 250,000 copies. While Kinsey insisted that he was simply reporting, 
not making value judgments, findings like the fact that 37 percent of all men 
and 13 percent of women had at least one homosexual experience or the fact that 50 
percent of married men and 26 percent of married women had committed adultery, 
shocked Americans and simultaneously created an “everybody’s doing it” mentality. 
Hugh Hefner played into that mentality when he fi rst published Playboy magazine in 
December 1953, which represented pure hedonistic pleasure…for men. Playboy linked 
sexuality with upward mobility and defi ned the good life as enjoying sex, liquor, smoking, 
and consumer products, without restraint. When Hefner published the fi rst issue, 
with Marilyn Monroe as the centerfold, he was deeply in debt but sold enough copies 
that he could issue another, and by 1960, Playboy sold over a million copies a month. 
Novelists joined in the celebration of sexuality. Grace Metalious, who had never 
written a book before, published Peyton Place in 1956, a novel that detailed scandalous 
affairs in a suburban context. Vladimir Nabokov, a respected writer, published 
Lolita , about the life of a young sex-addicted woman and a sex-obsessed middle-age 
man. In 1958, Grove Press published an unexpurgated edition of D. H. Lawrence’s Lady 
Chatterley’s Lover , unavailable previously in the United States. Whatever else Americans 
were doing in the privacy of their homes, larger numbers of them were clearly reading 
much more sexually explicit material in the 1950s than in any previous generation. 
Within this context of breaking from traditional cultural norms, other artists 
explored their own alienation in a conformist society. In J.D. Salinger’s novel, Th e 
Catcher in the Rye , the book’s teenage hero, Holden Caulfi eld saw adults as “phonies” 
who kept up pretenses that did not fi t reality. Novelists like Ralph Ellison, Flannery 
O’Connor, Saul Bellow, Bernard Malamud, James Baldwin, John Updike, Mary 
McCarthy, and Philip Roth explored America’s racism and the quiet desperation 
of many. In the late 1950s, poets and political radicals like Allen Ginsberg and Jack 
Kerouac took dissent to new levels. Th e “beat generation” challenged not only cultural 
pretentions of Eisenhower’s America, but the artistic pretentions of its major critics. 
In “Howl,” Ginsberg’s 1956 poem, he wrote, “I saw the best minds of my generation 
destroyed by madness.” It was Ginsberg’s good luck that police in San Francisco seized 
Howl and Other Poems as obscene and forced a trial that brought Ginsberg to national 
attention. Kerouac’s On the Road , published in 1957, glorifi ed escape from expectations 
and conventions. Some in the 1950s found themselves embracing Kerouac’s 
belief that, “Th e only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, 
mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones who 
never yawn or say a commonplace thing, but burn, burn, burn like fabulous yellow 
roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars.”

RACE AND CIVIL RIGHTS 
Analyze the growth and impact of the Civil Rights Movement between 1954 and 1965. 
Segregation, economic marginalization, and political disenfranchisement were reality 
for most African-Americans in the 1950s as they had been since the collapse of 
Reconstruction in the 1870s and 1880s (see Chapter 15 and Chapter 19 ). However, the 
African-American community never accepted segregation or second-class citizenship, 
and in the 1950s, it seemed as if African-American resistance to “separate but equal” 
burst forth in many diff erent places at about the same time (see Map 25-3). Legal challenges 
to school segregation that had been building for decades achieved a major victory 
in 1954. Soon thereaft er, long-simmering opposition to segregation in public transportation 
led to a year-long bus boycott in Montgomery, Alabama. Meanwhile, young African- 
Americans and some white supporters sat in at segregated lunch counters, organized 
voter registration drives, and found themselves considering signifi cant alternatives to 
American culture. 
The Long Road to Brown v. Board of Education 
On May 17, 1954, the United States Supreme Court announced its unanimous decision 
in the legal challenge to the racial segregation of public schools, a case known as 
Brown v. Board of Education . Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote: 
We conclude that in the fi eld of public education the doctrine of “separate but 
equal” has no place. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal. 
It had been a long road to the day of that fi nding. 
Th e National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), though 
founded in 1909, was oft en only whispered in black communities in the South throughout 
the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s. In the early 1950s, Anne Moody, then a high school student 
in Centerville, Mississippi, asked her homeroom teacher what NAACP meant. Th e 
teacher said, “You see the NAACP is trying to do a lot for the Negroes and get the right 
to vote for Negroes in the South.” She also warned Moody, “I shouldn’t be telling you all 
of this.…It could cost me my job.” Th e teacher was gone the following year. 
In the 1930s, the NAACP began to challenge state “separate but equal” laws, 
bypassing state legislatures and governors with federal court cases arguing that the 
separate facilities were, in fact, far from equal. Two brilliant lawyers took charge of the 
NAACP legal eff ort—Charles Hamilton Houston, then dean of the Howard University 
Law School, and his former student, Th urgood Marshall. When Houston retired in 
1938, Marshall, then just 30 years old, became the NAACP chief counsel, a position 
he held for 23 years. In 1961, Marshall was appointed as a federal judge serving on 
the U.S. Court of Appeals, and from 1967 to 1991, he served as the fi rst appointed 
African-American justice of the U. S. Supreme Court. 
Th e Houston-Marshall strategy at the NAACP was to chip away at segregation. In 
a 1938 case, Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada, Registrar of the University, et al. , the 
U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Lloyd Gaines could not be rejected by the University 
of Missouri Law School on the basis of his race unless the university could off er him 
an equally good legal education within the state of Missouri. To off er legal education 
to whites but not to blacks, or to force blacks to leave the state for their education, 
Chief Justice Hughes said, “is a denial of the equality of legal right.” In Alston v. School 
Board of the City of Norfolk in 1940, the NAACP won a ruling that said separate salary 
schedules for black and white teachers violated the Fourteenth Amendment. In 1950, 
the court issued two rulings. In Sweatt v. Painter, it said that separate law schools for 
blacks and whites were not equal, and in McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents , it ruled 
that segregating graduate students violated their equal protection rights. With each 
case, segregation was becoming more expensive for states to maintain and the arena

in which it could be exercised smaller. Th e time was coming for a direct challenge

approved “separate but equal” arrangements. 
While the NAACP lawyers were winning cases, students at the all-black R. R. Morton 
High School in Farmville, Virginia, called a strike to protest conditions at their school in 
1951. Although the white school in Farmville had comfortable facilities, some classes at 
R.R. Morton were held in tar-paper shacks, students had to wear coats to keep warm, 
and the teachers had to gather wood for the wood stoves. Th e authorities had long promised 
new facilities, but construction was continually postponed. 
Only aft er going on strike did the students appeal to the NAACP. Th e national 
organization sent word that they would consider taking the case, but only if the challenge 
was for completely integrated schools. Th e students agreed and called on the 
adults in their community to follow them. Th us was launched one of the fi ve cases that 
would be consolidated as Brown v. Board of Education . 
The five states whose policies were challenged in the NAACP suit hired the 
1924 Democratic presidential nominee John W. Davis as their attorney to defend the separate 
but equal policies. However, the Supreme Court agreed with the NAACP’s argument 
that separate education always violated the 14th amendment’s guarantee of “the equal protection 
of the laws.” Th e unanimous 1954 decision said, “We come then to the question 
presented: Does segregation of children in public schools solely on the basis of race, even 
though the physical facilities and other ‘tangible’ factors may be equal, deprive the children 
of the minority group of the equal educational opportunities? We believe that it does.” 
Th ere were those who thought that with the Brown decision the battle was over. 
Many years later, Kenneth Clark, whose testimony was central to the case, recalled 
ruefully, “How naïve I was!…I thought that within ten years or so, America would 
be free of it.…I expected southern states to resist, but I thought that their resistance 
would decrease and that we were on the road to some sort of functional democracy.” 
It would take much more.

Some governors began massive resistance to school integration. Th e most dramatic 
took place in Little Rock, Arkansas, in the fall of 1957. Rather than allow the racial integration 
of previously all-white Central High School, the state’s segregationist governor 
Orval Faubus ordered the Arkansas National Guard to stop nine African-American 
students from enrolling in the school. In a speech the night before school was scheduled 
to begin, Faubus said he was making the move because of a fear of violence. “Blood 
will run in the streets,” he said, if black students tried to enter Central High. 
Nine brave young students, known as the Little Rock Nine, were scheduled to test 
the integration of Central High School. Elizabeth Eckford remembered the terror 
when she found herself face to face with a white mob: 
Somebody started yelling, “Lynch her! Lynch her!” 
I tried to see a friendly face somewhere in the mob—someone who maybe 
would help. I looked into the face of an old woman and it seemed a kind face, 
but when I looked at her again, she spat on me. 
It was a harrowing experience that Eckford never forgot. 
Th e students, the mob, and the National Guard were all recorded on national television. 
While President Eisenhower was no advocate of school integration, he was not 
about to allow an order of the U.S. Supreme Court to be fl outed. He told his Attorney 
General Herbert Brownell, “Well, if we have to do this, and I don’t see any alternative, 
then let’s apply the best military principles to it and see that the force we send there is 
strong enough that it will not be challenged, and will not result in any clash.” Eisenhower 
sent riot-trained units of the 101st Airborne. Before nightfall, a thousand U.S. soldiers 
were in Little Rock, securing the high school and ensuring the safety of the students. 
Montgomery, Alabama 
In 1955, a year and a half aft er the Brown decision, Rosa Parks fi nished her work day in 
Montgomery, Alabama, and began her bus ride home. She took a seat in the prescribed 
“Negro section” in the back of the bus. A few blocks later, when more whites boarded, 
Elizabeth Eckerd, one of nine black students who sought to enroll at Little Rock Central High School in 
September 1957, endures the taunts of an angry white crowd as she tries to make her way to the school.

the driver, J. P. Blake, moved the line between the sections so that 
all of the whites could have seats. When none of the blacks moved, 
Blake warned them, “You better make it light on yourselves and let 
me have those seats.” When others moved, Rosa Parks stayed where 
she was. “Are you going to stand up?” Blake asked. Parks said, quite 
simply, “No.” 
Blake summoned the Montgomery police who arrested Parks. 
When she was allowed to call home, Parks told her mother of her 
arrest and her mother immediately got in touch with E. D. Nixon, 
the acknowledged leader of Montgomery’s civil rights community 
who was not a newcomer to making tough decisions. Nixon, then 56, 
was president of Montgomery’s chapter of the NAACP. He worked 
as a porter on the railroad and was vice-president of the Alabama 
branch of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, the most powerful 
black-led union in the United States. He had been one of the 
planners for the 1941 March on Washington. Nixon asked Cliff ord 
and Virginia Durr, Montgomery whites who were civil rights activists, 
to join him and the three went to the Montgomery jail to sign 
the bond for Rosa Parks’ release. Within a few hours, Parks was free 
and at home. 
Early in that evening, the matter could have ended. Th e court 
would probably have let Parks off with a small fi ne, and the segregated 
world of Montgomery could have returned to normal. 
But as Nixon and the Durrs talked with Rosa Parks, her husband, and her mother, 
the question arose: Was this incident the test case they had all been waiting for? 
In Brown v. Board of Education the year before, the Supreme Court had ruled that 
segregated schools were illegal. But what about transportation? If she were willing, if 
she could overcome her husband Raymond’s fear that, “Th e white folks will kill you, 
Rosa,” there could not be a better person than Rosa Parks for the test case they all 
sought. 
Parks had a long history as a civil rights activist. She fi rst tried to register to vote in 
1943 when only a very tiny percentage of Alabama blacks voted. She was told she did 
not pass the literacy test. Th e same thing happened in 1944. In 1945, she hand-copied 
every question on the literacy test while she was taking it, in an obvious fi rst step toward 
a legal challenge. Apparently the authorities wanted to avoid a legal challenge more 
than they wanted to avoid her vote. She received her registration in the mail and began 
voting in Alabama elections in 1946. In the summer of 1955, Parks attended a desegregation 
workshop at Highlander. “I was forty-two years old, and it was one of the few 
times in my life up to that point when I did not feel any hostility from white people,” 
Parks said. 
Given her background, many have wondered whether Parks’s action on the bus 
had been planned. She insisted it had not. But her life had prepared her for what happened. 
A few months later, Parks said, “Th ere had to be a stopping place, and this 
seemed to have been the place for me to stop being pushed around and to fi nd out 
what human rights I had, if any.” 
Parks, Nixon, and the Durrs retained a young African-American lawyer, Fred 
Gray, as her attorney. Nixon began calling the local ministers. Th e new minister at 
Dexter Avenue Baptist Church, Martin Luther King, Jr., was third on his list. Among 
the people Gray called that evening was Jo Ann Gibson Robinson, a professor at 
Montgomery’s all black Alabama State College and a leader in the black Women’s 
Political Caucus (WPC) in Montgomery, who remembered, “Telephones jangled; 
people congregated on street corners and in homes and talked.…[but] A numbing 
helplessness seemed to paralyze everyone.” Without consulting other leaders, 
Robinson and the WPC decided to call a boycott of the Montgomery buses when 
The arrest of Rosa Parks in 1955 for refusing to abide by the rules of the 
segregated buses of Montgomery, Alabama, represented an important 
moment in civil rights history, one of many developments that undermined 
the image of the 1950s as an era of total complacency with the 
status quo.

Parks went on trial. She, another professor, and two students pretended that they 
needed to grade papers and went to their offi ces in the middle of the night. By 4 a.m. 
the next morning, using the school’s mimeograph machine, they had prepared thousands 
of leafl ets that said: 
Another Negro woman has been arrested and thrown in jail because she 
refused to get up out of her seat on the bus for a white person to sit down.… 
Th is has to be stopped…We are, therefore, asking every Negro to stay off the 
buses Monday in protest. 
Between 4 a.m. and 7 a.m., Robinson and her students distributed the leafl ets. Th ey 
fi nished in time for Robinson to teach her 8 a.m. class on schedule and then distributed 
more leafl ets. 
Robinson’s leafl et fell into the hands of the white Montgomery Advertiser, which 
published news of the plan on its front page on Saturday, inadvertently helping 
the campaign along. The story was meant to inform the white community what 
was afoot, but it also meant that every black knew about the boycott. Nearly all of 
Montgomery’s blacks stayed off the buses that fi rst day. At a planning meeting on 
Monday afternoon, Martin Luther King, Jr., then 26 years old, was elected president 
of what would be called the Montgomery Improvement Association (MIA). 
As president, King was the main speaker at a Monday evening service. He called 
on Montgomery’s African-American community to protest with courage and dignity. 
Aft er King’s sermon, Ralph Abernathy, minister of Montgomery’s First Baptist 
Church proposed that the boycott continue until the demands—courteous treatment 
by the bus operators and the seating of passengers on a fi rst-come, fi rst-served basis, 
whites from the front, blacks from the back—were met. Segregation itself was not 
yet challenged, only the kind of humiliating enforcement of segregation experienced 
by Parks. From that evening it was clear; it was not to be a one-day boycott. People 
would wait as long as it took. 
Ultimately, it took a year-long boycott of the Montgomery buses to win the victory 
the black community wanted, and it took a combination of careful planning 
and inspirational preaching to get there. People needed courage and inspiration, but 
they also needed taxis and car pools to get them to work. Black-owned taxis off ered 
reduced fares. Th e ministers organized car pools to help people who needed to go the 
longest distances. 
Th e nation’s black leadership was not enthusiastic about events in Montgomery. 
The Montgomery bus boycott was a spontaneous outburst that national leaders 
had played no role in organizing. Roy Wilkins, the long-time national leader of the 
NAACP invited King to address the NAACP convention in San Francisco, but also 
expressed deep doubts about the boycott. Th urgood Marshall openly criticized King, 
preferring to stick with court cases. “All that walking for nothing. Th ey might as well 
have waited for the court decision,” Marshall said of the boycott. 
But as the year wore on, the boycott had its impact. Th e boycott received favorable 
national media attention. Fundraising became easier, and King found himself becoming 
a national celebrity. Th e aged W.E.B. Du Bois wrote that, though he still had his 
doubts about boycotts, if King’s passive resistance could undermine American racism, 
it would be a huge victory. On June 4, an appeals court ruled in favor of Rosa Parks, 
and on November 13, 1956, the United States Supreme Court concurred. Early in the 
morning of December 21, 1956, 1 year and 3 weeks aft er Rosa Parks had refused to 
move, King and a few others, followed by reporters, boarded the fi rst bus of the day. 
“We are glad to have you,” the polite driver said. 
In January 1957, King, Abernathy, and some 60 black ministers created the 
Southern Christian Leadership Conference , based in Atlanta, Georgia. The MIA 
had been a temporary organization focused on the bus boycott. Th e SCLC institutionalized 
the energy and the planning that had started in Montgomery and created a 
permanent national organization and a long-term platform for King.

Students and Sit-Ins 
On February 1, 1960, 3 years aft er the buses in Montgomery were integrated and as 
John F. Kennedy battled to win presidential primaries, four African-American freshmen 
at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical College sat down at the whites-only 
lunch counter of the Woolworth’s store in Greensboro, North Carolina. Th ey asked 
politely for service and ordered coff ee. Aft er sitting at the counter all day, they still had 
not received their orders. Nineteen students joined the sit-in the next day, and on the 
third day, they numbered 85. On the fourth day, more than 300 people joined the sit-in, 
Rosa Parks’ refusal to give up her bus seat in Montgomery, 
Alabama, in December 1955 led to a year-long boycott of the 
buses, launched the career of a young Montgomery minister, Martin 
Luther King, Jr., and changed the course of American history. But the 
boycott worked only because of many who never became famous. 
Besides Parks and King, some among the many who made 
the Montgomery boycott a national event: 
• Claudette Colvin —A young African-American who was 
arrested for refusing to give up her seat on a bus 9 months 
before Parks but who local leaders thought was not the 
right candidate for a test case because she was pregnant 
and unmarried. Her legal appeal was later combined with 
that of Rosa Parks. 
• E.D. Nixon —A long-time civil rights and union activist who 
commanded great respect in black and white communities 
in Montgomery. 
• Clifford and Virginia Durr —White residents of Montgomery 
who had long supported civil rights for African-Americans 
at considerable personal cost and who had national connections 
to help the local organizers. 
• Fred Gray —Then a 24-year-old lawyer in Montgomery who 
represented Rosa Parks. Gray had gone to law school with 
a private promise “to become a lawyer, return to Alabama, 
and destroy everything segregated I could find.” 
• Jo Ann Gibson Robinson and the Members of the Women’s 
Political Caucus— Were already urging male civil rights 
leaders to protest Montgomery’s segregated buses. 
• Ralph Abernathy —A respected senior minister and an officer 
of the NAACP who convinced King to support the bus 
boycott. 
• Mother Pollard —An elderly member of King’s congregation 
who responded to her pastor’s concern that she was too old to 
keep walking, replying, “My feets is tired but my soul is rested.” 
• A nd thousands of additional residents of Montgomery— 
Committed supporters who attended rallies, organized 
alternative forms of transportation, or simply walked to and 
from work for a year rather than break the boycott. 
In thinking about how best to teach the history of the Civil 
Rights Movement, Diana Turk, a professor at New York University, 
said: 
Ask most middle- and secondary-level students what 
they have learned about the Civil Rights Movement, and 
most likely they will tell you a story of great leaders who, 
through their bravery, and inspiring words, led millions 
to stand with them in the struggles for freedom, equality, 
and Civil Rights.…But…as engaging and inspiring as this 
tale of brave and inspiring leaders may be, much is lost 
when we look at history as a story of only a few individuals 
and their acts of heroism. As Dr. Adam Green, an historian 
of the black Civil Rights Movement in the United States, 
importantly argues, great leaders don’t get very far unless 
they have great organizers behind them; someone needs 
to plan and announce boycotts and marches, set up rallies, 
arrange for speeches and press coverage, and spread 
the word about the events that together make up movements.…
Not only can a focus on organizers give students 
a sense of some of the important—and often forgotten— 
forces that helped shape history, but such an approach also 
can empower students to see how seemingly small, localized, 
and unheralded actions can truly change the course 
of human events.

Thinking Critically 
1. Historical Interpretation 
What role did each of the figures described above play in the 
boycott? How did their efforts reinforce each other? 
2. Construct an Argument 
Defend or refute the following statement: “The Montgomery 
bus boycott proves that the most important social change is 
produced by action on the local level.”

expanding it to another store’s lunch counter. Th is group action was not a well-planned 
event. Th e established civil rights leaders in neither the NAACP nor King’s SCLC had 
been involved and, indeed, knew nothing of it until aft er the fact. Th ey struggled to 
decide whether to support, ignore, or lead the sit-ins. But it didn’t matter what they did. 
Th e student-led sit-ins that started in Greensboro spread like wildfi re across the South. 
Before February ended, there were sit-ins in 31 cities in eight southern states. One 
of the largest and longest took place in Nashville, Tennessee. After hearing of the 
Greensboro actions, over 500 well-dressed African-American college students walked 
into downtown Nashville and sat down at lunch counters in all of the major stores. 
Th e Nashville police allowed a mob to beat many of the demonstrators, and more than 
60 protesters were jailed in Nashville. Th e mayor sought compromise and agreed to 
appoint a biracial committee to look at segregation in the stores. Th e appointment of 
the committee was a victory long sought by Nashville’s older civil rights leaders, and 
it had been won by the students. By July, the lunch counters in Greensboro had also 
become desegregated. 
While many of King’s peers were not sure what to make of the sit-ins, and the 
NAACP Legal Defense Fund was not willing to defend those arrested, King endorsed 
them, seeing the sit-ins as a way to confront segregation nonviolently and directly. He 
continued to defend the sit-ins to an older and very wary civil rights community, and 
the sit-ins continued to grow in signifi cance. 
From Freedom Rides to Birmingham to Washington—“I Have a 
Dream,” 1963 
While the sit-ins continued, the U.S. Supreme Court in a 1960 ruling, Boynton v. 
Virginia declared that any segregation in interstate transportation was unconstitutional. 
James Farmer and others in the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) decided 
to test the decision with “freedom rides” to hasten integration of interstate bus service 
The lunch counter sit-ins, launched by these students at a segregated lunch counter in Greensboro, North 
Carolina, in February 19 60, began a new and powerful phase of the Civil Rights Movement.

and terminals through the South. Th ey warned the Attorney General and the FBI in 
advance. When the seven blacks and six whites on the two buses began their trip in 
May 1961, they encountered violence fi rst in Rock Hill, South Carolina, where John 
Lewis was beaten when trying to enter a white rest room, then in Anniston, Alabama, 
where one of the buses was burned and most of the riders beaten. All of the riders were 
beaten again when a bus reached Birmingham, Alabama—one white rider so badly he 
suff ered permanent brain damage. An FBI informer had reported Ku Klux Klan plans 
to attack the Freedom Riders, but at no point did they get any federal protection. New 
riders who joined the eff ort were also beaten and arrested. Eventually, 328 freedom 
riders were arrested in the summer of 1961. 
When the new Kennedy administration called for a “cooling-off ” period, Farmer 
responded that “blacks have been cooling off for 150 years. If we cool off any more, 
we’ll be in a deep freeze.” Finally in the fall, Attorney General Robert Kennedy convinced 
the Interstate Commerce Commission to order that any bus or train that 
crossed a state line (and thus under the Constitution became subject to federal rules) 
could not use any segregated facilities. 
In September 1962, James Meredith became the first black to enroll at the 
University of Mississippi, backed by a federal court order. In response, Mississippi 
governor Ross Barnett promised that “No school will be integrated in Mississippi 
while I am your governor.” Robert Kennedy thought he had a promise from Barnett 
to keep order on the campus, but when Barnett instead whipped up a crowd of some 
3,000 whites who began throwing rocks and eventually shooting, Kennedy sent federal 
marshals and then federal troops, who restored order at the university. 
Early in 1963, King began a campaign to desegregate Birmingham, Alabama, perhaps 
the most segregated city in the South. He expected resistance. King was promptly arrested 
during a protest—and used the time to write one of his most famous publications, “Letter 
from Birmingham Jail.” Th e Birmingham police, under their chief “Bull” Connor also 
arrested some 3,000 protesting children and turned fi re hoses and attack dogs on children 
and adults. Civil rights organizers also met with violent resistance elsewhere. Medgar 
Evers, the NAACP fi eld secretary in Jackson, Mississippi, was murdered on his front porch 
that June. Riots erupted in northern cities in July. Who knew what was coming next? 
The Birmingham, Alabama, police force used dogs to attack Civil Rights demonstrators, a response that 
brought worldwide condemnation.

Widespread television coverage brought an international outcry about the violence 
in Birmingham, including criticism by the Soviet Union. President Kennedy, 
who had been slow to act on civil rights, but feared bad publicity especially in the 
context of the Cold War, introduced his long-promised civil rights bill in June 1963. 
Kennedy told Congress that “Th e heart of the question is whether all Americans are to 
be aff orded equal rights and equal opportunities.” To support the proposed civil rights 
bill, civil rights leaders A. Philip Randolph and Bayard Rustin called for a March on 
Washington. On August 28, 1963, more than 20 years aft er Randolph fi rst proposed a 
march on Washington, and 100 years aft er Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation 
Proclamation, over 200,000 Americans marched in the nation’s capital and listened to 
speeches at the Lincoln Memorial. 
The keynote address of the March on Washington was delivered by Martin 
Luther King, Jr. In words that have become immortal, King declared his hope for 
America in spite of all the injustice that the Civil Rights Movement was encountering. 
In spite of all the setbacks, King said “I still have a dream,” that the situation in 
America could change. In the cadences of traditional black preachers, using words 
from Katherine Lee Bates, Th omas Jeff erson, and the biblical prophet Isaiah, King 
preached the hope that, in America, black people and white people could, indeed, be 
sisters and brothers . 
Martin Luther King’s “I Have a Dream” speech is now iconic, but in August 1963, 
it took courage to make that speech not only because civil rights workers and leaders 
were being beaten and killed, as King would be, but also because many would think 
such hopes foolish and empty. Even as King spoke, it was unclear whether Kennedy 
or the Congress would do much to expand freedom or pass a civil 
rights bill. 
The Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and 
Mississippi 
On Easter weekend of 1960, some of the students who had been 
participating in sit-ins across the South gathered at Shaw University 
in Raleigh, North Carolina. Ella Baker, who helped organize the 
Raleigh meeting, later recalled, “Just as the sit-ins had skyrocketed or 
escalated without rhyme or reason, so too the response to the concept 
of a conference escalated beyond our expectations.” James Lawson, 
who had played a major role in the sit-in movement in Nashville and 
had been expelled from the Vanderbilt University Divinity School for 
his eff orts, also joined the Raleigh conference. He told the students 
that their actions were “a judgment upon middle-class conventional, 
halfway efforts to deal with radical social evil.” The students voted 
to form their own organization rather than affiliate with either the 
SCLC or the NAACP. Th us, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating 
Committee (SNCC) was born. 
No one did more to shape SNCC than Ella Baker. Baker 
had worked for the NAACP in the 1940s. Martin Luther King 
recruited her to the SCLC in the 1950s, but she found herself deeply 
frustrated by the male dominance of the minister-led SCLC. Her own 
philosophy was that “People have to be made to understand that they 
cannot look for salvation anywhere but to themselves.” John Lewis, 
the youngest speaker at the March on Washington and another SNCC 
founder, said “We all recognize the fact that if any radical social, political, 
and economic changes are to take place in our society, the people, 
the masses must bring them about.” Like many in SNCC, Lewis was 
distrustful of any single charismatic leader, even King. In the sit-in 
movement and in SNCC, Baker and Lewis found like-minded souls.

Bob Moses arrived in Atlanta in the summer of 1960 to volunteer with SNCC 
during his vacation from his job as a teacher in New York City. As Moses traveled 
through the rural South, he met some amazing people like Amzie Moore who lived far 
from the centers of civil rights activity. Moses described meeting Moore: 
He was the only adult I met on this trip who had clearly fi xed the students 
in his sights. It was as if he had been sitting there in Cleveland [Mississippi] 
watching the student movement unfold, waiting for it to come his way, knowing 
it had to eventually come, and planning ways to use it in light of his fi ft een 
year eff ort, since World War II, at making changes in the cotton plantation 
land of the Mississippi delta. 
Moses would encounter more people like Moore on his travels, and they changed 
him. 
Moses learned that while Moore appreciated the legal work of the NAACP, integration 
was not his priority. His passion was the vote. Living in a congressional 
district that was two-thirds black, it was obvious to Moore what the vote could do. 
Moses wrote to the SNCC offi ce in Atlanta, “Amzie thinks, and I concur, the adults 
here will back the young folks but will never initiate a program strong enough to do 
what needs to be done.” Th us was born SNCC’s focus on a massive student-led campaign 
for the vote. In 1961, Moses returned to Mississippi to work full time on voter 
registration for SNCC. 
In September 1961, Herbert Lee, a supporter of the voter registration effort in 
Amite County, Mississippi, was shot by E. H. Hurst, a white state representative. 
Hurst admitted that he had shot Lee but was never prosecuted for the murder. Other 
murders followed. 
Even when the threat of violence and murder was not imminent, people who 
had lived with segregation and violence all their lives were reluctant to challenge 
the system. In the winter of 1963–64, SNCC developed a plan to bring a thousand 
mostly white college students to Mississippi to help with the voter registration eff ort 
and to focus national attention on the denial of rights in Mississippi. Some SNCC 
fi eld organizers worried that so many whites would undermine the strength of the 
black community. On the other hand, grass-roots leaders like Fannie Lou Hamer 
argued, “If we’re trying to break down this barrier of segregation, we can’t segregate 
ourselves.” In June 1964, thousands of student volunteers, white and black, arrived 
for what became Mississippi Freedom Summer to register local African-Americans 
to vote and to demonstrate to the nation what an interracial coalition looked like. 
Th ey were met with considerable hostility. Th ree of the volunteers, James Chaney, a 
black, and Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner, both white, were killed in late 
June near Philadelphia, Mississippi. Th ere were also tensions within the movement, 
yet Mississippi Freedom Summer garnered national publicity for voting rights and 
changed the lives of many who participated. 
As more blacks registered to vote, they also organized the Mississippi Freedom 
Democratic Party (MFDP) to challenge the offi cial all-white Mississippi delegation 
for the August 1964 Democratic Convention at which Lyndon Johnson, then president, 
was to be nominated for reelection. Just weeks before the national convention, 
hundreds of newly registered Mississippi voters, having been turned away from the 
regular all-white Democratic Party meetings in Mississippi, met in Jackson and elected 
68 delegates to the convention. 
The MFDP succeeded in raising the denial of voting rights in Mississippi to 
national attention even though its delegation was not seated at the national convention. 
Th e convention made Fannie Lou Hamer, a 47-year-old Mississippi sharecropper 
and spokeswoman for MFDP, a national voice. Bob Moses described the MFDP 
delegates as “sharecroppers, domestic workers, and farmers” who were asking the 
national Democratic Party to truly be the party of such people” while also “taking the 
fi rst step toward gaining control over their lives.”

Fears Joys Limits 1945 W hen Fannie Lou Hamer gave her testimony at the national 
Democratic Convention, she had come a long way from a 
SNCC voter registration meeting. “Until then,” she said, “I’d never 
heard of no mass meeting and I didn’t know that a Negro could 
register and vote.…When they asked for those to raise their hands 
who’d go down to the courthouse the next day, I raised mine. Had it 
up as high as I could get it.” 
It was the 31st of August in 1962 that eighteen of us traveled 
twenty-six miles to the county courthouse in Indianola 
[Mississippi] to try to register to become first-class citizens. 
We was met in Indianola by policemen, Highway Patrolmen, 
and they only allowed two of us in to take the literacy test at 
the time. After we had taken this test…we continued on to 
Ruleville…where I had worked as a timekeeper and sharecropper 
for eighteen years. I was met there by my children, who told 
me that the plantation owner was angry because I had gone 
down to try to register.… 
He said, “If you don’t go down and withdraw your registration, 
you will have to leave.” Said, “Then if you go down and withdraw,” 
said, “you still might have to go because we are not ready for that 
in Mississippi.” 
And I addressed him and told him and said, “I didn’t try to register 
for you. I tried to register for myself.” 
I had to leave that same night.… 
[Hamer also described her subsequent arrest:] 
I was carried to the county jail and put in the booking room.… 
I was carried out of that cell into another cell where they had 
two Negro prisoners. The State Highway Patrolmen ordered the 
first Negro to take the blackjack [a wooden club]. 
The first Negro prisoner ordered me, by orders from the State 
Highway Patrolman, for me to lay down on a bunk bed on my 
face. 
I laid on my face and the first Negro began to beat…I began 
to scream and one white man got up and began to beat me in 
my head and tell me to hush.… 
I was in jail when Medgar Evers was murdered. 
All of this is on account of we want to register, to become 
first-class citizens. And if the Freedom Democratic Party is not 
seated now, I question America. Is this America, the land of the 
free and the home of the brave, where we have to sleep with our 
telephones off the hooks because our lives be threatened daily, 
because we want to live as decent human beings, in America? 
Thank you.

The North and Malcolm X 
By the 1960s, half of the nation’s African-Americans lived in the North, most in 
racially segregated urban neighborhoods. While the hopes of blacks in the South 
generally focused on ending the brutal segregation and on winning the right to 
vote, the hopes of northern blacks focused on ending segregated housing patterns, 
poor quality schooling, and economic marginalization. One of the most 
prominent voices for northern urban blacks was Malcolm X. As Marcus Garvey 
had done for a previous generation, Malcolm spoke of pride, self-suffi ciency, and 
self-determination. 
Malcolm was born Malcolm Little in Omaha, Nebraska, in 1925. He remembered 
the grinding poverty, racism, and violence of Depression Era America. 
As a young adult, Malcolm pursued a life of crime and in February 1946, just 
before his 21 birthday, received a 10-year sentence for a string of burglaries. In his 
Autobiography he said, “I had sunk to the very bottom of the American white man’s 
society.” 
While he was in prison, Malcolm experienced a religious conversion and joined 
the Nation of Islam, or the Black Muslims as they were commonly known. When he 
was released in 1952, he moved to Detroit and was soon named assistant minister at 
Detroit Temple Number One. Th e Black Muslims believed that it was important to 
reject traditional last names—which they saw as slave names since many came from 
former slave owners—and so Malcolm Little became Malcolm X. His message as a 
minister was, “We didn’t land on Plymouth Rock, my brothers and sisters—Plymouth 
Rock landed on us !…It was a mix of pride and separation from white people— the 
“white devils”—along with a call for total allegiance to Allah and Allah’s Messenger 
Elijah Muhammad. 
Malcolm disdained integration and the southern Civil Rights Movement. While 
he was gaining fame as “the fi ery Black Muslim,” Malcolm was also starting to have 
his doubts about Elijah Muhammad. Early in 1964, he broke with the Nation of Islam 
and set off on a pilgrimage to Mecca as is required of every devout Muslim man. 
In Mecca, Malcolm found himself among Muslims from all over the world. He was 
transformed by the experience. When a fellow pilgrim asked him what about the Hajj 
had impressed him the most, Malcolm answered, “Th e brotherhood ! Th e people of 
all races, colors, from all over the world coming together as one ! It has proved to me 
the power of the One God.” No longer would he preach separation for its own sake. 
He was not any less militant, but Malcolm returned from Mecca as El-Hajj Malik 
El-Shabazz, a devout traditional Muslim. 
When he returned to New York in 1964, Malcolm explained his new beliefs. He 
said of his experience in Mecca, “In the past, yes, I have made sweeping indictments 
of all white people. I never will be guilty of that again—as I know now that some white 
people are truly sincere, that some truly are capable of being brotherly toward a black 
man.” He was willing to join interracial coalitions to achieve immediate goals and 
would work within as well as against the political system. 
Malcolm was not willing to adopt King’s nonviolence and believed African- 
Americans needed to defend themselves. In 1964, he met Fannie Lou Hamer. When 
he heard her describe the beating she had received, he said, “When I listened to Mrs. 
Hamer, a black woman—could be my mother, my sister, my daughter—describe 
what they had done to her in Mississippi, I asked myself how in the world can we 
ever expect to be respected…and we do nothing about it?” He was not the advocate of 
violence that others portrayed him to be, but at one point he said, “Let sincere whites 
go and teach non-violence to white people!” 
After his break with the Nation of Islam, he established his own independent 
Muslim Mosque Incorporated to preach what he believed was a truer Islam than 
that taught by the Black Muslims. He also established a political organization,

Americans and whites from, for example, 
marrying, dining, going to school, or 
socializing together—ensured racial 
discrimination. In the North, segregation 
undergirded the social structure. However, 
African-American leaders started to make 
advancements in their fi ght for equality in 
the 1950s and 1960s. Civil rights activists 
protested across the South, making 
national headlines. In the industrial cities 
of the North and West, large numbers of 
African Americans arrived in the Second 
Great Migration between 1940 and 1970 
as they sought better opportunities than 
the South aff orded them. From these 
cities, many also began to speak out for an

the Organization of Afro-American Unity (OAAU) to advance his political agenda. 
His top priority, he said, was to submit “the case of the American Negro before the 
United Nations.” Rather than focus on federal legislation, Malcolm believed that 
African-Americans had a case to bring their continuing marginalization before the 
UN, and with the support of African and Middle Eastern nations, he was confi dent 
they would win. 
More important than any organization, however, Malcolm fostered a new sense 
of pride in a generation of northern African-Americans. He challenged the quality 
of education in black communities. He led demonstrations against police violence. 
He called on African-Americans to “control the politics in his own residential areas 
by voting…and investing in the businesses.” He had a vision of African-Americans 
making international alliances with the people of the then newly independent African 
nations and with the Muslim world. As the scholar Manning Marable said of him, 
“Malcolm’s great strength was his ability to speak on behalf of those to whom society 
and state had denied a voice due to racial prejudice.” 
Th e new Malcolm was willing to accept white coworkers, but not to be led or controlled. 
He dreamed that the day might come when, “In our mutual sincerity we might 
be able to show a road to the salvation of America’s very soul.” Malcolm was assassinated 
by Nation of Islam followers in February 1965. But he would continue to inspire 
great hopes long aft er he was gone.

Malcolm X (1925–1965) was eloquent, passionate, 
a courageously outspoken champion of black 
people, and a critic of American racism. Today he 
is an iconic fi gure memorialized in poems, song, 
fi lms, books, and operas. 
CONCLUSION 
Th e 1950s was a decade of contrasts. For many, they were the complacent decade when 
Dwight Eisenhower presided over a nation that had won World War II and was happy 
to move to new suburban homes and domestic contentment. At the same time, threat 
of the hydrogen bomb greatly infl uenced U.S. foreign and domestic policy throughout 
the 1950s, and the space race with the Soviet Union prompted Americans to panic 
about the state of its education system. Among African-Americans, the many-faceted 
Civil Rights Movement transformed their lives and U.S. practices of segregation. 
During the Eisenhower administration (1953–1961), the United States pursued 
policies that attempted to minimize the costs of the Cold War, protect the non- 
Communist world from Communist infiltration, and avoid armed confrontation. 
Key pieces of Eisenhower’s foreign policy included the threat of “massive retaliation” 
with hydrogen bombs and the extensive use of spying and covert operations in 
foreign countries. When the Soviet Union launched the first space satellite, the 
American government responded by creating the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration (NASA) to manage space exploration and by establishing new 
domestic programs linking education to national defense. 
Th e 1950s were relative peaceful and prosperous for many Americans. Th e economy 
continued to grow, and many experienced a substantial increase in family income. 
Americans also became much more religious during the period—a phenomenon still 
not fully understood. At the same time, television came to dominate American popular 
culture. Most of the programming of the 1950s sought to reaffi rm the suburban lifestyles 
of the white middle class, and new 30-second television commercials encouraged 
Americans to buy everything from Alka-Seltzer to automobiles. Th e automobile also 
rose to prominence in 1950s America, giving rise to new industries to support cars and 
to an interstate highway system. However, America’s love aff air with the automobile 
required a steady supply of cheap gasoline—an issue that would come to dominate 
American politics. 

792 Part VIII Fears, Joys, and Limits, 1945–1980 
In the 1950s, although segregation, marginalization, and political disenfranchisement 
were commonplace for African-Americans, the modern Civil Rights Movement 
came into full swing. After decades of court challenges by the NAACP, the U.S. 
Supreme Court finally ruled in 1954 that racial segregation of public schools was 
unconstitutional. Civil rights protesters also successfully boycotted segregation of the 
public transportation system in Montgomery, Alabama, and of lunch counters across 
the nation. 
While the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the Student Nonviolent 
Coordinating Committee worked for integration and voting rights in the South, a very 
diff erent civil rights leader emerged in the North. Malcolm X became a prominent northern 
voice for the nation’s African-Americans. He rejected the integration-focused strategy 
of southern civil rights leaders and spoke of pride, self-suffi ciency, and self-determination 
for blacks free from white interference. Malcolm was assassinated in February 1965, but 
the Civil Rights Movement, led largely by Martin Luther King, Jr., continued to press for 
full equality throughout the 1960s.

Summary 
Postwar foreign policy was profoundly shaped by the possibility 
of nuclear war. Eisenhower’s foreign policy centered on two 
key elements: the threat of massive nuclear retaliation and the 
use of covert operations. Under Eisenhower, the CIA was given 
the task of destabilizing and overthrowing foreign governments 
that were deemed unfriendly to U.S. interests. In some areas 
such as Indochina, the United States took the place of declining 
European imperial powers. The Soviet launch of Sputnik 
sparked U.S. entry into the “space race.” Over the course of 
Eisenhower’s 8 years in office, efforts toward better relations 
between the United States and the Soviet Union moved forward 
in fi ts and starts, with both sides remaining wary of the other. 
In 1960, John F. Kennedy won a narrow victory over Richard 
Nixon, which signaled to many Americans that a generational 
shift had occurred in American politics.

Summary 
In the 1950s, African-Americans and their supporters launched 
a multipronged movement to combat segregation and discrimination. 
Decades of sustained eff ort by the NAACP and other 
organizations culminated in the 1954 Supreme Court ruling 
in Brown v. Board of Education that overturned the doctrine 
of “separate but equal.” Implementation of the Brown decision 
faced intense resistance from many white southerners. 
The Montgomery bus boycott focused attention on segregation 
and discrimination in public transportation and made 
Martin Luther King, Jr., a national figure. Student activists 
played crucial roles in the civil rights protests of the early 1960s, 
particularly through sit-ins, Freedom Rides, and black voter 
registration. In the North, Malcolm X off ered an alternative to 
the southern Civil Rights Movement that rejected nonviolence 
and had its roots in black nationalism.

1961–1968 
Lives Changed 
This widely publicized picture of an antiwar demonstrator putting a fl ower in the end of a rifl e at 
the October 1967 March on the Pentagon refl ects some of the deepest divisions of the 1960s. 
In 1960 while Kennedy and Nixon contested the presidency, a handful 
of white students organized Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) . 
SDS represented a new birth of activism on the part of white young 
people just as the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) had 
given voice to the activism of African-American students (see Chapter 25 ) . 
Th e birth of groups like SDS and SNCC guaranteed that the 1960s would 
not be as quiet as the 1950s. As Bob Dylan, the best known folk singer of the 
early 1960s sang, “Th e times they are a changing.” 
Student protesters and folk singers were far from the only signs that 
something new was brewing in American culture aft er 1960. New literature 
signaled the change that was coming. Between 1961 and 1963, three women 
authors published books challenging fundamental issues: Jane Jacobs, the 
way cities were developing; Rachel Carson, the pollution of the environment; 
and Betty Friedan, the “quiet desperation” of many women’s lives. Th ey were 
not alone; authors increasingly challenged various aspects of American life. 
Th e new president also represented a generational change in American 
politics. This chapter traces the many changes that some Americans 
embraced, others rejected, but few ignored as the United States experienced 
the decade known to many simply as “the sixties.”

NEW VOICES, NEW AUTHORITIES 
Explain the growing social protest in books, films, and student movements starting in the 
early 1960s. 
Th ough it was formative for many, the Civil Rights Movement was only one of many 
challenges to American culture in the 1960s. Writers and artist had oft en been uncomfortable 
with the conformity of the 1950s, and their uneasiness took on new forms 
as the new decade began. Small political movements burst onto a larger stage. Th e 
result was a number of books, fi lms, and songs that refl ected and helped shape a rapidly 
changing culture while wide-ranging protest movements, oft en led by students, 
changed not only college campuses but also the country. 
Books, Films, Music 
Jane Jacobs was a writer and activist in New York’s Greenwich Village when she wrote, 
Th e Death and Life of Great American Cities in 1961. In the opening line of that book, 
Jacobs said, “Th is book is an attack on current city planning and rebuilding.” Indeed, it 
was an amazingly successful attack. Refl ecting on the book’s impact, one urban planner 
wrote, “When an entire fi eld is headed in the wrong direction…then it probably 
took someone from outside to point out the obvious.” Aft er Jacobs, city planners in 
New York and most cities turned away from massive highway development, sprawling 
suburbs, and isolated urban high-rise buildings to focus on smaller, more neighborhood 
friendly options. Projects to bulldoze slums and build highways were replaced in 
the 1960s by the redevelopment of existing urban neighborhoods. Jacobs did not bring 
about this change single-handedly, but her book was a guidebook to a new generation 
of urban planners. 
Two books published in 1962 played a similar role in other movements. Rachel 
Carson’s Silent Spring is oft en called the bible of the conservation movement. Other 
people dating back to Th eodore Roosevelt talked about conserving rather than taming 
nature, but Carson gave the preservation movement a new voice in the 1960s. 
While most earlier conservation eff orts focused on protecting land from development, 
Carson described in graphic detail what pesticides were doing to birds and animals. 
Michael Harrington’s Th e Other America , also published in 1962, is sometimes credited 
with launching the Kennedy-Johnson era War on Poverty. Harrington’s was far from 
the only voice urging a new look at the urban and rural poverty that had gone unnoticed 
in the affl uent 1950s, but Harrington’s book sold over a million copies, and the critic 
Dwight McDonald convinced President Kennedy to read it. In his own way, Harrington, 
like Carson and Jacobs, put a human face on an otherwise easily ignored domestic issue. 
Describing the way poverty was hidden in modern America cities, Harrington wrote, 
“The poor still inhabit the miserable housing in the central area.…The failures, the 
unskilled, the disabled, the aged, and the minorities are right there, across the tracks, 
where they have always been. But hardly anyone else is.…Th ey have no face; they have 
no voice.” Th e War on Poverty began to change that situation in 1964 and 1965. 
Betty Friedan’s Th e Feminine Mystique , published in 1963, played an equally central 
role in the development of the new women’s movement of the late 1960s and early 
1970s (see Chapter 27 ) . Th e Feminine Mystique named what Friedan called the “problem 
that has no name”: the “comfortable concentration camp” where white middleclass 
suburban women lived. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, a generation of women 
found multiple ways to break out of this and other “concentration camps.” 
Each of these books sold thousands, sometimes hundreds of thousands of copies. 
Th ey were read by college students and people of every age bracket, and were discussed 
on the radio and television, in newspaper editorials, in sermons in religious 
communities, and around family dinner tables, bringing their ideas to many who 
never read them. Each book refl ected changes that were already underway and, at the 
same time, each speeded change.

Films and music had possibly even more 
infl uence on Americans. In the 1960s, fi lm and 
music took on a new and harder edge. Stanley 
Kubrick’s Dr. Strangelove portrayed the leaders 
of the United States and the Soviet Union as 
crazed militarists willing to destroy the world. 
Later in the decade, Bonnie and Clyde (1967), 
The Wild Bunch , and Easy Rider (both 1969) 
showed a level of violence not previously seen 
in film, reminding audiences that this world 
was still a very violent one. 
Many who had enjoyed the provocative rock 
‘n’ roll sexuality of Elvis in the 1950s listened to 
the provocative protest folk songs of Bob Dylan 
and Joan Baez in the early 1960s and later to 
the drug-infl uenced acid rock of Jimi Hendrix, 
Pink Floyd, and the Grateful Dead in the later 
1960s. Change, protest, and disengagement 
were increasingly refl ected in fi lm and song. 
Protest songs and angry movies, however, 
did not completely dominate the media in the 
1960s. Th e sentimental celebration of love and 
marriage, The Sound of Music (1965), earned 
$100 million, the highest gross income of any move up to that time. Th e Adventures 
of Ozzie and Harriet continued to be one of the most popular TV series up to 1966. In 
addition, the traditional music on the Lawrence Welk Show and the symphonic pop 
music of Henry Mancini competed with folk and rock throughout the decade. Th e 
sixties were far from a unifi ed decade, in culture or politics, but the very depth of the 
disunity was one of the hallmarks of the times. 
The Student Movement of the 1960s 
Universities had long been the location for challenges to the norms of the larger society. 
During the Great Depression of the 1930s, there were many student demonstrations. 
But the sheer numbers of students and the new attitudes of the baby boom 
generation who came to college in the 1960s transformed college life. In 1947, as a 
result of the GI Bill, college enrollments reached an historic high, and they continued 
to grow in each following decade. 
Budgets for higher education grew even faster than enrollments. As sociologist 
and 1960s student activist Todd Gitlin noted, “By 1960 the United States was the 
fi rst society in the history of the world with more college students than farmers.” Ten 
years later, the nation had three times as many students as farmers. Although most of 
the students of the late 1940s and 1950s had been relatively quiet, the students of the 
1960s were not. 
Students who had founded the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) in 1960 
met at Port Huron, Michigan, in 1962 to draft a statement of their beliefs. Th e 1962 
Port Huron statement, of which Tom Hayden, then a graduate student, was the 
prime author, began, “We are people of this generation, bred in at least modest comfort, 
housed now in universities, looking uncomfortably to the world we inherit.” 
Recognizing their baby boom origins, the statement continued, “Many of us began 
maturing in complacency,” but then, “[a]s we grew, however, our comfort was penetrated 
by events too troubling to dismiss.…the Southern struggle against racial bigotry 
[and] the enclosing fact of the Cold War.” The Port Huron statement noted, 
“a yearning to believe there is an alternative to the present, that something can be 
done to change circumstances in the school, the work places, the bureaucracies, the 
Joan Baez and Bob Dylan, singing together at the 1963 Newport Folk Festival, represented a new folk 
music that was often linked directly to protest movements.

government.…It is to this latter yearning, at once the spark and engine of change, that 
we direct our present appeal.” Th e spark and the “yearning to believe there is an alternative 
to the present,” would characterize the decade of the 1960s for many people, 
especially the young. 
Not long after SDS was launched, another student movement emerged at the 
University of California at Berkeley. In the fall of 1964, the Berkeley administration 
issued a directive that student organizations that were raising funds for off -campus 
causes such as civil rights using tables set up on the university grounds had to move 
those eff orts off campus. Opposition to the directive quickly united students. When 
petitions and meetings with the university administration did not resolve the issue, a 
group of students, some of whom had spent the previous summer in the South as part 
of Mississippi Freedom Summer, called for civil disobedience in Berkeley. 
Students brought their tables back to campus and waited to see what would happen. 
Before long, campus police arrived and arrested Jack Weinberg who had been 
Rachel Carson grew up in an isolated rural community 15 
miles northeast of Pittsburgh on the Allegheny River. As an 
adult, she worked for the federal Fish and Wildlife Service while 
also writing independently, publishing The Sea Around Us , a 
description of life in the ocean in 1951. The book was a great success, 
and Carson decided to then take on a study of the impact 
of DDT and other chemicals on the environment. The result was 
Carson’s most famous book, Silent Spring , which not only caught 
public imagination but also changed the way many Americans 
thought about the environment. Silent Spring was first published 
as a series of articles in The New Yorker in 1962, then published as 
a book that same year, and in 1963, aired as part of a CBS television 
series in 1963. Carson warned: 
Since the mid-1940s over 200 basic chemicals have been 
created for use in killing insects, weeds, rodents, and other 
organisms described in the modern vernacular as “pests”; and 
they are sold under several thousand different brand names. 
These sprays, dusts, and aerosols are now applied almost 
universally to farms, gardens, forests, and homes—nonselective 
chemicals that have the power to kill every insect, the 
“good” and the “bad,” to still the song of birds and the leaping 
of fish in the streams, to coat the leaves with deadly film, and 
to linger on in the soil—all this though the intended target 
may be only a few weeds or insects. Can anyone believe it is 
possible to lay down such a barrage of poisons on the surface 
of the earth without making it unfit for all life? They should 
not be called “insecticides,” but “biocides.” 
Along with praise for the book, Carson was criticized, most of 
all by the chemical industry whose products her research and 
writings indicted. Spokespersons for some of the major chemical 
companies and even some of Carson’s former colleagues in 
the Department of Agriculture attacked the book as an effort to 
turn the clock back to a time when insect-born diseases, most of 
all malaria, killed thousands and wiped out crops causing widespread 
starvation. 
President Kennedy, however, was impressed enough with 
the book to order his Science Advisory Committee to review 
it. When the committee confirmed her findings, Kennedy and 
subsequent administrations took further action, banning the 
domestic use of DDT. Later in 1970, President Nixon signed the 
legislation creating the Environmental Protection Agency to 
consolidate the government’s efforts to protect the environment 
that Carson loved.

sitting at one of the tables, placing him in a police car. Quickly, some 3,000 students 
surrounded the car, and for the next 32 hours, while Weinberg sat in the car, speaker 
aft er speaker used the top of the car as a platform. Th e long spontaneous rally launched 
the free speech movement at Berkeley. 
In December of that year, at a much larger student rally on the Berkeley campus, 
Mario Savio, a junior philosophy major who emerged as the prime voice of the student 
protest during the siege of the police car, told his fellow students, “Th ere’s a time 
when the operation of the machine becomes so odious…you’ve got to put your bodies 
upon the gears and upon the wheels, upon the levers, upon all the apparatus and 
you’ve got to make it stop.” Hundreds marched into the administration building to 
stop the university’s wheels. Th ey sat in for two days until arrested. Berkeley remained 
a center of student protest. 
Quick Review How did student protest, changes in popular music, and the inauguration of 
John F. Kennedy symbolize the changes coming to the United States in the early 1960s? 
CAMELOT, THE WHITE HOUSE, AND DALLAS—THE KENNEDY 
ADMINISTRATION 
Analyze the successes and failures of the Kennedy administration and how they interacted 
with popular culture in the United States 
Th e student protests were but one aspect of the changes taking place in the early 1960s. 
Th e January 1961 inauguration of John F. Kennedy (referred to oft en as JFK) brought 
the youngest president elected in the nation’s history to replace the oldest. A new generation 
was taking charge of the country from college campuses to the White House. 
Kennedy partisans remembered his years in offi ce as “one brief shining moment”—to 
cite the lines of the then-popular Camelot, a Broadway play about medieval glory to 
which the Kennedy’s glamour was oft en compared. Certainly John Kennedy, his young 
and attractive wife Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy, and their extended family made for 
a dramatic comparison with the sometimes dowdy Eisenhowers. Th ey were able to 
project an image of glamour, youth, vigor (the president’s favorite word, pronouncing 
it with his Boston accent as “vigah”), and wit. Th e press loved to spar with Kennedy 
and he with them. During the Kennedy years, the White House was the scene of gala 
events, concerts, and dinner parties not seen in Washington for some time. Th e hopes 
and expectations for change that arrived with Kennedy were unmistakable. 
The New Frontier 
Civil rights advocates also had high hopes for the Kennedy administration, believing 
that the new president, who had gone out of his way as a candidate to support 
Martin Luther King, Jr., would do more to support the cause of civil rights than 
Eisenhower. Th e Kennedy administration created a Committee on Equal Employment 
Opportunities headed by Vice President Johnson to look into discrimination in hiring. 
Th ey hired blacks in the federal government, including some in high positions in 
the civil and foreign service. JFK nominated African-Americans, including Th urgood 
Marshall, to federal judgeships. During the presidential campaign in 1960, Kennedy 
promised to introduce a new federal civil rights bill if elected. But throughout 1961 
and 1962, no such bill emerged from the White House. He also had promised to end 
racial discrimination in federal housing with the “stroke of a pen,” but when no order 
emerged, civil rights organizers started sending thousands of pens to him. 
Kennedy was slow to move on civil rights for many reasons. He could count votes 
in the Congress, and southern Senators with high seniority made congressional action 
hard to imagine. Th e Kennedys were also good at gauging voter interest, and in 1961 
26.2

and 1962, not that many white voters seemed interested in civil rights issues. At the 
same time, J. Edgar Hoover hated Martin Luther King, Jr., and was convinced that he 
was a sexual degenerate and a Communist. He had tapes to prove extramarital activity 
on King’s part, if nothing to show that he was a Communist. Hoover also had tapes to 
prove President Kennedy’s considerable extramarital activities, which may well have 
made both Kennedy brothers reluctant to challenge Hoover, who they allowed to tap 
King’s telephones. Whatever the reasons, the vaunted Kennedy vigor was not brought 
to civil rights. 
In other areas, Kennedy’s New Frontier , as he called his domestic policy, was 
more successful. Working closely with House Speaker Sam Rayburn, the administration 
was able to win an increase in the federally mandated minimum wage. At 
their urging, Congress also provided funds for job training and tougher regulations 
for testing new drugs before they went on the market. JFK was the first president 
since Herbert Hoover to include no women in the cabinet, but he appointed Eleanor 
Roosevelt to head the Presidential Commission on the Status of Women that recommended 
federal laws against sex discrimination. Kennedy issued executive orders 
ending sex discrimination in the federal civil service and signed an 1963 Equal Pay 
Act that mandated equal pay for equal work. In part because of his mentally ill sister, 
Kennedy cared deeply about mental health and, at his urging, Congress passed the 
Mental Retardation Facilities and Community Mental Health Act in 1963 that funded 
support for mental health programs. 
In May 1961, Kennedy, who had been critical of the lack of interest in space exploration 
by the Eisenhower administration, advocated a signifi cant increase in funding 
for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and made a promise 
that within 10 years the United States would safely land a man on the moon. Although 
Kennedy did not live to see the promise fulfi lled, in 1969, the nation celebrated that 
accomplishment. 
Th e chair of his Council of Economic Advisers, Walter Heller, convinced Kennedy 
that a tax cut would stimulate the economy leading to greater prosperity for Americans 
and improved standing of the Kennedy administration with voters. Kennedy fought

hard for the tax cut and won. Nevertheless, the domestic record was disappointing 
to the administration, which would have liked to see faster congressional action on 
many of its proposals. Th e New York Times for November 12, 1963, said, “Rarely has 
there been such a pervasive attitude of discouragement around Capitol Hill…Th is has 
been one of the least productive sessions of Congress within the memory of most of 
its members.” 
Religion, Education, and the Courts 
Just as Kennedy had his reasons for not wanting to deal with civil rights, he also 
had very strong reasons for not wanting to deal with the issue of religion. As the 
fi rst Catholic to be elected president, he wanted to steer clear of anything that might 
imply his religion was infl uencing his work. But as with civil rights, issues of religion 
were bubbling. 
On June 25, 1962, the U.S. Supreme Court announced its decision in the case of 
Engel v. Vitale . By a 6-1 vote, the Court declared that schools in New York State could 
not open the school day with prayer. Th e specifi c issue in Engel v. Vitale was of relatively 
recent origin. As the Cold War led to a fear of “godless communism,” the New 
York State Board of Regents, which had responsibility for all public schools in the 
state of New York, recommended—but did not require—opening the school day with 
prayer. Th en in 1958, the board composed a short offi cial prayer, “Almighty God, we 
acknowledge our dependence upon Th ee, and we beg Th y blessings upon us, our parents, 
our teachers and our Country.” It was as inoff ensive as a prayer could be, and 
any students who objected could be excused when it was recited. Nevertheless, the 
prayer caused problems. Nonbelievers did not want to say any prayer. Devout believers 
found such a bland prayer close to blasphemy. When Joseph and Daniel Roth 
asked to be excused from their Long Island classroom during the prayer because their 
father asked them to, they were taunted. Th eir father, Lawrence Roth, challenged the 
prayer in court. As the case was combined with others and moved through the courts, 
it generated public attention and anger. In the end, Justice Hugo Black spoke for the 
Supreme Court majority in saying, “We think that the constitutional prohibition 
against laws respecting an establishment of religion must at least mean that in this 
country it is no part of the business of government to compose offi cial prayers.” 
A year later, the court went further. Edward and Sidney Schempp challenged the 
policy of the Abington Township School Board (Pennsylvania), which opened the 
school day with a Bible reading and the Lord’s Prayer. In a 1963 decision, Abington 
School Board v. Schempp , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that, no matter who composed 
the prayers, the school board’s practices or any devotional reading of scriptures 
or recitation of prayers was unconstitutional. Th e court went out of its way to insist 
that the academic study of religion, including the study of the Bible “for its literary and 
historic qualities,” was not only constitutional but also to be encouraged. However, it 
was not the business of government, the Court said, to lead devotional activities. 
The Supreme Court’s decisions provoked a fire storm. Many Americans, 
Protestants and Catholics, claimed that the court was “legislating God out of the public 
schools” and that historic practices that “had never bothered anyone” were being 
undermined by an unusually activist Warren court. New York Congressman Frank 
J. Becker proposed an amendment to the Constitution to allow voluntary prayer and 
Bible reading. Th e evangelist Billy Graham said, “Th e trend of taking God and moral 
teaching from the schools is a diabolical scheme.” Alabama Governor George Wallace 
said, “I don’t care what they say in Washington, we are going to keep right on praying 
and reading the Bible in the public schools of Alabama.” While Catholics had once 
opposed devotional activities in public schools, sure that they would be Protestant, 
now New York Archbishop Francis Cardinal Spellman said he was “shocked and 
frightened” by the court’s decisions. For large numbers of Americans, the decisions 
were the beginnings of a cultural war that would last for decades.

Kennedy’s Foreign Policy—From the Bay of Pigs to the Cuban 
Missile Crisis 
In a private conversation with his defeated rival, Richard Nixon, President Kennedy 
asked Nixon, “Foreign aff airs is the only important issue for a president to handle, isn’t 
it?” Kennedy said he really didn’t care about the minimum wage “compared to something 
like Cuba.” While Americans receiving minimum wage might care a great deal about it, 
Kennedy’s focus was, indeed, Cuba, Germany, Vietnam, China, and perhaps most of all 
the Soviet Union. In his inaugural address, Kennedy had promised to “pay any price, bear 
any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival 
and success of liberty.” He came to offi ce a devout Cold Warrior and remained one. 
Th e fi rst test of Kennedy’s Cold War resolve came early. Th e corrupt government 
of Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista had been overthrown at the beginning of 1959 in 
the middle of Eisenhower’s second term. Th e new revolutionary government led by 
Fidel Castro was very popular in the United States during its fi rst few months in offi ce. 
Castro was welcomed in the United States and even appeared on the Ed Sullivan 
Show . Organized crime, which had enjoyed a haven for gambling and prostitution 
in Cuba under Batista, was driven out by Castro to the applause of most Americans. 
However the Cuban-American relationship quickly soured. Th e new revolutionary 
government executed a number of Batista supporters—too many, most Americans 
thought. As part of its land reform eff orts, the Castro government seized the island’s 
large commercial enterprises, including vast holdings of American sugar and oil companies. 
Unhappy business interests—legitimate and illegitimate—began a public relations 
campaign against the new Cuban government. Castro’s communist leanings also 
became clearer as Cuba developed close ties with the Soviet Union. Before long, Soviet 
military advisers arrived in Cuba. By the time Kennedy came to offi ce in January 1961, 
many considered Cuba to be a virtual satellite of the Soviet Union. Th e Eisenhower 
administration had developed plans to train a volunteer force to invade the island. 
Influential people, including JFK’s father, former ambassador Joseph P. Kennedy, 
urged Kennedy to take action. While some advisers had reservations, Allen Dulles, the 
head of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), was a strong advocate, and Secretary of 
Defense McNamara and the Joint Chiefs of Staff approved the invasion. 
On April 15, 1961, less than 3 months aft er JFK took offi ce, American-based planes 
made an initial bombing run against the island. Two days later, a brigade of 1,400 
U.S. volunteer troops landed at the Bay of Pigs on Cuba’s south coast. Th e plan was 
for the force to connect with other Cuban anti-Castro forces that the CIA was convinced 
were ready to rise up against the regime. In fact, no internal revolt sprang up. 
Cuban defenses were strong. When the attackers called for further air support from 
the United States, Kennedy refused. He had become convinced that the attack was 
doomed. Within hours, 114 of the invaders were killed and 1,189 taken prisoner. Th e 
Bay of Pigs fi asco was a huge embarrassment for Kennedy. He took personal responsibility 
for the failure. He also fi red Allen Dulles. For the rest of his term, Kennedy 
would be more cautious and less willing to trust advisers in the CIA. 
Kennedy’s fi rst summit with Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev took place in June 
1961 in Vienna, just 2 months aft er the Bay of Pigs crisis. Th e meeting did not go well. 
Khrushchev gloated over the Soviet Union’s success in getting the fi rst man into space 
when Yuri Gagarin orbited the earth in April. He also made threatening comments 
about Berlin. Khrushchev seemed to believe that the new president was weak and could 
be brow-beaten. In fact, his actions only strengthened Kennedy’s inclination to show he 
could be tough. Two months later, Khrushchev ordered the construction of what came 
to be known as the Berlin Wall to separate the Soviet zone of the city from the western 
zone and the construction of similar barriers separating all of East Germany from 
West Germany. German Communists complained that their socialist system provided 
free education for people who then took their skills west to make more money. Aft er 
August 1961, no such easy movement, nor were family visits or other travel possible. 
Bay of Pigs 
A 1961 invasion of Cuba by anti-Castro rebels 
backed by the Kennedy administration that 
was quickly defeated, much to Kennedy’s 
embarrassment. 
Berlin Wall 
A substantive partition built by East 
Germany on instructions from the Soviet 
Union that cut off all travel between East 
and West Berlin from 1961 to 1989.

By fall, Berlin had become very tense. Some Kennedy advisers suggested that the 
United States should use force to stop construction of the Berlin Wall. Others wondered 
whether access would be blocked as it was at the time of the Berlin Airlift . By the 
end of October, U.S. and Russian tanks faced off in Berlin. Some wondered whether 
World War III was about to begin. Eventually, the United States and the Soviet Union 
compromised. Kennedy acknowledged that he would “rather have a wall than a 
war,” and that the Soviets had a right to build the Berlin Wall. Khrushchev did not 
try to close off American or western access to Berlin as Stalin had done. While the 
city remained a fl ash point in the Cold War, and the Berlin Wall stayed in place until 
November 1989, the Berlin crisis of 1961 passed. 
Th e third major foreign policy crisis of the Kennedy administration—and the most 
dangerous—took place in October 1962. Again, the focus was Cuba. Aft er the U.S. 
failure in the Bay of Pigs invasion, Cuban-Russian ties grew stronger and the Soviets 
sent more military personnel to Cuba. In the summer of 1962, the Soviets began 
building missile bases in Cuba that could house medium-range missiles pointed at the 
United States. As U.S. reconnaissance fl ights showed proof of the missiles in Cuba, 
it became clear that a major crisis—the Cuban missile crisis —was brewing. 
In this crisis atmosphere, Kennedy convened an “Executive Committee” of the 
National Security Council. For 13 tense days in October 1962, these advisers debated 
the next U.S. step. Moderates led by UN Ambassador Adlai Stevenson urged restraint. 
Why panic about a new missile site, they asked, when the United States had missiles 
in Turkey and there were enough submarine-based missiles to destroy the planet?

States and the Soviet Union in October 
1962 at which each country stood on the 
brink of nuclear war over the placement of 
Soviet missiles in Cuba.

Hard-liners, including former Secretary of State Dean Acheson and National Security 
Adviser McGeorge Bundy, urged an immediate U.S. attack on the missile site. A third 
group, led by Robert Kennedy, opposed a surprise strike, which, RFK said, would 
make his brother, “the Tojo [the Japanese premiere who ordered the attack on Pearl 
Harbor] of the 1960s.” Th e president agreed with his brother’s position and overruled 
the hard-liners, but he was also determined to be tough. 
On October 22, President Kennedy informed Khrushchev in both a diplomatic 
communication and a prime-time television speech that the United States would 
enforce a complete “quarantine” against future military shipments to Cuba and that 
the United States would meet any Soviet retaliation anywhere in the world with a “full 
retaliatory response.” Th e stakes could not be higher. If a Soviet ship ran the blockade, 
it would be fi red on by the United States. If the Soviets made a military move, the 
United States was prepared to fi re missiles. Many worried that the world was on the 
brink of nuclear war. Th e next morning, as the fi rst Soviet ships approached, people 
held their breaths. Th en the Soviet freighters turned around. Secretary of State Dean 
Rusk said, “We’re eyeball to eyeball, and the other fellow just blinked.” 
Behind the scenes, Kennedy and Khrushchev had come to an agreement. The 
Soviets agreed to remove the missiles in return for an end to the quarantine of the 
island and a promise that the United States would not invade. The United States 
also agreed to remove its missiles from Turkey but did not announce its decision. 
An unthinkable war had been avoided. Both leaders quickly took steps to avoid a 
repeat of the crisis and new communication systems—especially a “hot line” from the 
Pentagon and White House to the Kremlin—were set up so there would be no delay 
in communication in any future crisis. 
Some military leaders and Cuban exiles were furious at Kennedy. U.S. Air Force 
General Curtis LeMay (who had commanded the bombing of Tokyo in 1945) 
stunned the president when he told him, “It’s the greatest defeat in our history, Mr. 
President.…We should invade today.” Others wondered whether Kennedy allowed 
his machismo to get the best of him when the missiles in Cuba were no more of a 
threat than others already in place and hardly worth a world war. 
While the crises in Cuba, Berlin, and then Cuba again were the most signifi cant 
of Kennedy’s foreign policy, the president also faced others. In spite of the 1960 campaign 
rhetoric in which Kennedy had accused Eisenhower of allowing a “missile gap” 
to develop between the United States and the Soviet Union, once in offi ce, Kennedy 
acknowledged that no such gap existed. Nevertheless, the Kennedy administration 
increased military spending from $47.4 billion when it took offi ce to $53.6 billion in 
its last budget. Th e United States expanded the number of Polaris submarines armed 
with missiles as well as the number of land-based missiles in the United States. Each 
side had enough missiles to destroy the world multiple times. 
Th e administration created a new “fl exible response” policy as an alternative to 
Eisenhower’s “mutually assured destruction.” They gave high priority to creating 
“counterinsurgency” forces, named the Green Berets, that could engage in small-scale 
military operations in hot spots around the world. In planning for Cuba, where the 
administration had a special interest, they developed Operation Mongoose, a secret 
CIA program to destabilize the Castro regime by contaminating Cuban sugar, causing 
explosions in Cuban factories, and developing at least 33 plans to assassinate 
Castro, all of which failed. 
In addition to Kennedy’s foreign policy efforts to contain communism, the 
administration launched a new eff ort at peace in Laos, support for the U.S. Agency for 
International Development (AID), and eff orts at economic reform in Latin America 
and elsewhere. Kennedy also launched the Peace Corps , through an Executive Order,

By the end of his fi rst term, however, Kennedy’s foreign 
policy legacy was mixed. Chester Bowles, who served for a 
time as Undersecretary of State in the Kennedy administration, 
said that the Kennedy inner circle were “full of belligerence” 
and “sort of looking for a chance to prove their muscle.” 
A nuclear-armed world was a dangerous place to do such a 
thing. Nevertheless, in November 1963, in spite of ongoing 
tensions in Southeast Asia, Berlin, and Cuba, JFK was still 
immensely popular in many parts of the world, and the world 
was at peace. Th e president turned his attention to his 1964 
reelection campaign. 
Dallas, Conspiracies, and Legacies 
The Kennedy team wanted to ensure that Texas, home of 
the vice president, stayed Democratic in 1964. But the 
Democratic Party in Texas was deeply divided. There was 
also deep distrust of Kennedy in Texas by 1963, indeed, even 
a deep visceral hatred among some Texans. In November 
1963, Kennedy dreaded the trip he needed to make to build 
his standing in the Lone Star State. 
Aft er the president and Jackie Kennedy arrived in Dallas 
on November 22, 1963, they rode into the city center in a 
caravan, the president and First Lady along with Texas Governor John Connally and 
his wife in the fi rst car, Vice President Johnson in the next one. A little aft er noon, as 
they passed the Texas School Book Depository, several shots rang out. One wounded 
Connally. Two hit the president. A back brace he wore for constant back pain held 
him erect and the second shot hit his head. By the time the president’s car reached 
the nearest emergency room, the president was dead. A Catholic priest off ered the 
last rites. 
Vice President Lyndon Johnson had been right behind Kennedy’s car and quickly 
understood what had happened. Neither Johnson nor anyone else knew how many 
people were involved in the assassination or how widespread the danger might be, so 
Johnson insisted that the presidential party wait until Kennedy’s coffi n was brought 
to Air Force One, still parked at the airport where it had arrived that morning. In the 
aft ernoon Johnson, fl anked by his wife Lady Bird and by Jacqueline Kennedy, took 
the presidential oath of offi ce. Th en they fl ew to Washington. Kennedy’s death provoked 
an outpouring of national grief. Suddenly, the youthful vigor that the president 
had projected, and the hopes that many Americans had projected onto him, 
seemed to dim. 
Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested for the murder. His fingerprints were on the 
gun and he had easy access to the window where the shots were fi red. Two days later, 
another troubled man, Jack Ruby, shot Oswald in the Dallas police station. Many 
suspected a widespread conspiracy. President Johnson asked Supreme Court Chief 
Justice Earl Warren to lead a high-level bipartisan commission to fi nd out the truth. 
The commission’s report—known as the Warren Report—concluded that Oswald 
acted alone. Not everyone was convinced; no one could confi rm for sure the whole 
story behind Kennedy’s death. Whatever the truth, a very diff erent kind of person 
became president on November 22, one who would lead the administration and the 
country with a dramatically diff erent style and set of priorities.

THE COMING OF LYNDON B. JOHNSON 
Analyze the successes and failures of the Johnson administration in terms of the two issues 
that dominated his years in office—the launching of the Great Society programs and the 
war in Vietnam 
John F. Kennedy had been born to wealth and had attended Harvard College. As a 
child he had met Franklin D. Roosevelt because his father was Roosevelt’s ambassador 
to Great Britain. He was elected to Congress as a war hero aft er his small boat, 
PT-109 had been sunk in the Pacifi c during World War II, and he had served 8 years in 
the U.S. Senate before becoming president. Kennedy was handsome and charismatic, 
important factors in his election and continuing popularity. 
Lyndon Johnson was born to poverty in the Texas hill country northwest of San 
Antonio and grew up in a small house in Johnson City when there were no sidewalks 
or electricity. His tough and slightly wild father served in the Texas legislature, trying 
hard to make ends meet, and his strong-willed mother yearned for a better life. LBJ, 
as he was oft en called, attended Southwest Texas State Teachers College. He arrived in 
Washington as a congressional secretary a year before Roosevelt was elected and managed 
to meet FDR, whom he idolized and who in 1935 appointed the then 26-yearold 
LBJ as the director of the National Youth Administration for the state of Texas. 
Johnson worked harder than any other NYA state director, got important services for 
Texas, and never forgot the value of government when he saw the New Deal bring 
jobs, electricity, and hope to people living isolated lives in rural poverty. 
Johnson had a long and distinguished career in Congress before becoming vice 
president. He was first elected to the House of Representatives in 1937. He campaigned 
tirelessly and worked equally tirelessly once in offi ce, building strong ties and 
coalitions. LBJ and his wife Lady Bird became a family for the sometimes lonely bachelor, 
Sam Rayburn, another Texan, who served as Speaker of the House for all but 
4 years between 1940 and 1961. LBJ lost a primary race for a Senate seat in 1941 but 
won the seat in 1948. Once in the Senate, Johnson built connections to the powerful 
committee chairs. In 1953, at the age of 45, he was elected Democratic leader in the 
Senate. In 1955, he suff ered a severe heart attack, recovered quickly and kept working, 
kept building coalitions, becoming known for the “Johnson Treatment” when he 
would grab a colleague by the coat lapels and hold his face an inch away while using 
anger, humor, and statistics to win a wavering vote. He was highly respected for his 
ability to get things done in the Senate, even if he was oft en feared and seldom liked. 
Few said he was handsome or charismatic. Everyone said he was eff ective. 
Johnson hated his tenure as vice president. Many of Kennedy’s inner circle, especially 
Attorney General Robert Kennedy made sure he was kept out of the most signifi 
cant decisions. Once he became president, LBJ desperately wanted to be loved as 
Kennedy had been, but most of all was determined to get things done in a way that 
Kennedy had not been able to do. On the domestic front, he succeeded masterfully at 
moving his agenda along before slowly sinking into the morass of Vietnam. 
The War on Poverty and the Great Society 
In his first speech as president, 5 days after Kennedy was shot, LBJ mourned with the 
nation, but he also demonstrated a confi dent leadership that the country was looking for. 
Johnson told the Congress that he was determined to continue the “Kennedy dream” of 
education, jobs, care for the elderly, and “equal rights for all Americans.” One could question 
whether, given his focus on foreign policy, those goals had actually been Kennedy’s dream, 
but they would certainly be Johnson’s. Th us, the fi rst president from a former Confederate 
state insisted, “No memorial or oration or eulogy could more eloquently honor President 
Kennedy’s memory than the earliest possible passage of the civil rights bill for which he 
fought so long.” Congress was being put on notice that the former powerful Democratic 
majority leader of the Senate, now president, was determined to see his legislation passed.

Later, aft er he left offi ce, Johnson explained his approach to the presidency. “If 
it’s really going to work, the relationship between the President and the Congress 
has got to be almost incestuous. He’s got to know them even better than they know 
themselves. And then, on the basis of this knowledge, he’s got to build a system 
that stretches…, from the moment a bill is introduced to the moment it is offi cially 
enrolled as the law of the land.” And that was exactly what Johnson did. He made 
sure he knew who would support each bill, knew what the specifi c desires were of 
those who might be brought to support a measure, and knew how to cajole those who 
did not want to support it. He rewarded supporters with phone calls, personal notes, 
White House invitations, and special services in their states and districts, and he never 
hesitated to punish opponents. He came to offi ce with a Democratic majority in both 
houses of Congress and a nation mourning a fallen president. He used that circumstance, 
plus his incredible legislative skill, to move signifi cant legislation through an 
oft en reluctant Congress. 
Six months after he had taken the oath of office in Dallas, Lyndon 
Johnson gave the commencement address at the University 
of Michigan. He used the speech to outline a new program—a 
Johnson program to be known as the Great Society—to improve the 
quality of life for all Americans. 
I have come today from the turmoil of your Capital to the 
tranquility of your campus to speak about the future of your 
country.… 
Your imagination, your initiative, and your indignation will 
determine whether we build a society where progress is the servant 
of our needs, or a society where old values and new visions 
are buried under unbridled growth. For in your time we have the 
opportunity to move not only toward the rich society and the 
powerful society, but upward to the Great Society. 
The Great Society rests on abundance and liberty for all. It 
demands an end to poverty and racial injustice, to which we are 
totally committed in our time. But that is just the beginning. 
The Great Society is a place where every child can find knowledge 
to enrich his mind and to enlarge his talents.… 
So I want to talk to you today about three places where we 
begin to build the Great Society—in our cities, in our countryside, 
and in our classrooms.… 
Our society will never be great until our cities are great. Today 
the frontier of imagination and innovation is inside those cities 
and not beyond their borders. 
New experiments are already going on. It will be the task of 
your generation to make the American city a place where future 
generations will come, not only to live but to live the good life.… 
A second place where we begin to build the Great Society is 
in our countryside. We have always prided ourselves on being 
not only America the strong and America the free, but America 
the beautiful. Today that beauty is in danger. The water we drink, 
the food we eat, the very air that we breathe, are threatened with 
pollution. Our parks are overcrowded, our seashores overburdened. 
Green fields and dense forests are disappearing.… 
A third place to build the Great Society is in the classrooms of 
America. There your children’s lives will be shaped. Our society 
will not be great until every young mind is set free to scan the 
farthest reaches of thought and imagination. We are still far from 
that goal.… 
These are three of the central issues of the Great Society.… 
So, will you join in the battle to give every citizen the full 
equality which God enjoins and the law requires, whatever his 
belief, or race, or the color of his skin? 
Will you join in the battle to give every citizen an escape from 
the crushing weight of poverty? 
Will you join in the battle to make it possible for all nations 
to live in enduring peace—as neighbors and not as mortal 
enemies? 
Will you join in the battle to build the Great Society, to prove 
that our material progress is only the foundation on which we 
will build a richer life of mind and spirit?

808 Part VIII Fears, Joys, and Limits, 1945–1980 
Johnson’s fi rst agenda was the stalled civil rights bill. Everyone expected the bill 
that Kennedy had submitted to be watered down. Johnson, normally the great compromiser, 
would not allow any tampering with the bill. He was determined to keep 
every section intact. He broke with his Senate mentor, Richard Russell of Georgia 
who led the opposition to the bill, and, instead, made an alliance with the Republican 
Senate Minority Leader, Everett Dirksen of Illinois. With Dirksen’s help, Republicans 
and Democrats overcame a Russell-led fi libuster. Th e most sweeping civil rights bill 
since Reconstruction was passed and signed by Johnson on July 2, 1964. It included 
not only provisions for equal access and equal opportunity but also specifi cally forbade 
discrimination in employment based on race, color, religion, and national origin 
as well as outlawed discrimination based on sex, a clause that later feminists would 
use most effectively. The law established a new Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission to ensure enforcement. 
As Johnson pushed hard for the Civil Rights Act of 1964, he also tackled a 
broader agenda. In his fi rst State of the Union speech in January 1964, Johnson said, 
“Th is administration, today, here and now, declares unconditional war on poverty 
in America.” Then in May, he used the commencement speech at the University 
of Michigan to describe what he called the Great Society , which would be how he 
described all of his domestic programs. Kennedy had already started eff orts to attack 
poverty in the United States, but Johnson, the New Dealer from Texas, had seen what 
federally fi nanced rural electrifi cation did to change the lives of poor people and was 
passionate (see Map 26-1 ). He idolized Franklin Roosevelt and wanted to imitate him. 
He also knew that if he wanted to remain in offi ce, he would have to face a skeptical 
electorate in only 11 months and he wanted to present a solid track record. 
Th e fi rst legislation of the war on poverty was passed by Congress in August 1964. 
It included provision for many of the programs later associated with the Great Society, 
including Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA), a domestic peace corps that 
recruited young people to work for a year serving in high poverty urban and rural 
settings; a Neighborhood Youth Corps to provide jobs for poor youth (modeled on 
the Civilian Conservation Corps of the New Deal era); work study loans and grants to 
support college students; small business loans; community action programs directed 
at building up grass-roots organizing ventures; Head Start to provide poor children 
with the same sort of readiness for kindergarten that their more well-off counterparts 
got at home; Neighborhood Legal Services that provided government funded 
lawyers for the poor; and to coordinate all of these ventures, an Offi ce of Economic 
Opportunity. Th is impressive agenda was only a fi rst step for Johnson, but to do more, 
he needed to be elected in his own right. 
Johnson wanted to not only win election in 1964 but also win with such a mandate 
that nothing could stand in the way of his programs. Before he could do that, however, 
Johnson had to face a divided Democratic Party, a Republican opponent, and his 
own inner demons. Johnson’s insecurities ran deep. He knew that the Kennedy family 
despised him. He knew that he did not have their urbane sophistication and that, a 
century aft er the Civil War, much of the country still distrusted southerners. He also 
knew—powerfully so—that he had become president—the offi ce he had wanted all his 
life—only through a terrible tragedy. 
Despite his concerns, however, Americans saw LBJ as the sitting president who 
had taken command of the situation when JFK was killed, and Johnson had no serious 
resistance to the 1964 nomination. Notwithstanding, Johnson was under great 
pressure to name Attorney General Robert Kennedy as his running mate. Th ere was a 
logic to the move; Bobby (as he was always known) was keeper of the Kennedy legacy 
and his nomination would unite the party. Still, as Johnson later wrote, “With Bobby 
on the ticket, I’d never know if I could be elected on my own.” In addition, Johnson 
deeply disliked Bobby Kennedy. He was convinced that Bobby had tried to derail his 
own vice presidential nomination in 1960. Eventually, LBJ informed Bobby that he

would not be his running mate and, instead, supported him in a successful run for 
the U.S. Senate from New York. Johnson selected liberal Minnesota Senator Hubert 
Humphrey to be his vice president. Humphrey, though more liberal than Kennedy or 
Johnson, was also deeply loyal to Johnson, perhaps even to a fault. 
The most serious challenge to Johnson’s easy nomination came from the 
Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP), in which grass-roots civil rights 
activists sought the convention seats of the regular Mississippi delegation that had 
been elected in white-only caucuses (see Chapter 25 ) . Although Johnson was a supporter 
of civil rights, he was concerned that, if the “regular” Mississippi delegates 
were unseated by the Mississippi Freedom delegates and walked out, and those from

Alabama and other nearby states joined them, then it 
would threaten the Democrats’ hold on several southern 
states. Johnson did not want to risk a repeat of the 1948 
Dixiecrat revolt. Neither Johnson nor other party leaders 
understood the depth of anger that stirred the MFDP 
protest, nor did they see, as the MFDP leaders did, the 
way in which the movement represented a new form of 
grass-roots democracy. Neither the choice of running 
mate nor the MFDP challenge hurt Johnson’s election 
chances, but both illustrated deep divides in American 
politics that even Johnson’s masterful negotiating skills 
could not bridge. 
Th e Republican Party was also deeply divided in 1964. 
The original front runner for the Republican nomination, 
New York’s liberal governor Nelson Rockefeller, had 
left his wife of many years to marry a younger woman. 
At that point, the country had never elected a divorced 
person as president. Th ere was also further opposition to 
Rockefeller’s nomination. Many conservative Republicans 
were determined that in 1964 the party would nominate a 
“real conservative,” and Rockefeller’s main opponent for 
the nomination was a true conservative, Arizona Senator 
Barry Goldwater. 
Goldwater, an aff able and tolerant individual, had friends across the political 
spectrum and spurned personal racial prejudice. However, he opposed civil rights 
legislation as an invasion of personal freedom. He felt the same way about the graduated 
income tax and most other government programs. Further, he called for a more 
aggressive opposition to communism than that taken by Eisenhower, Kennedy, or 
Johnson, even in places where communist regimes were well established, saying that 
America, “could lob one into the men’s room at the Kremlin.” He won most of the 
primary contests, and when the Republican convention met in San Francisco, the 
delegates were so committed to him that they shouted down Nelson Rockefeller. 
When Goldwater spoke, he said, “Let me remind you that extremism in defense of 
liberty is no vice…and that moderation in pursuit of justice is no virtue.” It was 
just what the delegates wanted to hear. It was less popular, however, with the wider 
electorate. 
Th e Democrats made good use of Goldwater’s statements, developed a sophisticated 
television advertising campaign, and painted Goldwater as a dangerous man. 
Johnson won in a landslide. As he left the inaugural ball in January 1965, Johnson told 
his staff , “Don’t stay up late. Th ere’s work to be done. We’re on our way to the Great 
Society.” Th e next day that work started. 
In the spring of 1965, the triumphant Johnson pushed four major pieces of legislation 
through Congress in addition to a raft of other bills that, on their own, would 
have been considered signifi cant with any other Congress. Th e core Great Society legislation 
of 1965 included federal aid to education, Medicare and Medicaid, immigration 
reform, and a Voting Rights Act. 
Johnson knew that federal aid to education had been blocked for many years by 
civil rights activists out of the fear that aid might go only to segregated schools and by 
a deadlock between Catholic representatives, who would not support aid unless it went 
to parochial as well as public schools, and many Protestant representatives, who would 
never support aid to Catholic schools. Johnson was determined to break the deadlock. 
Th e Civil Rights Act of 1964 solved the fi rst issue since it made it illegal for any segregated 
institution to receive federal aid. Johnson solved the divide on religion with a 
policy by which federal education funds would follow the child, whichever school the

explosion and ends, “Vote for President Johnson on November 3.” The ad was part of 
an eff ective campaign in which Democrats painted the Republican nominee, Barry 
Goldwater, as ready to lead America into nuclear war.

child was in. Th e Elementary and Secondary Education Act was submitted to Congress 
in January 1965 and passed in 3 months. Johnson signed it at a ceremony in front of a 
school that he had once attended, with one of his former teachers sitting beside him. 
Every Democratic president since Franklin Roosevelt had also sought to provide 
federal health insurance, especially for the elderly. A coalition, led by the American 
Medical Association, fearing government control of medical practices, stopped every 
effort. However, half of all Americans over 65 had no health insurance and they, 
too, were a powerful constituency. Within months of being proposed, Congress 
created Medicare, offering basic medical insurance to everyone over 65. Arkansas 
Congressman Wilbur Mills, a close Johnson ally, added a provision to the Medicare 
bill, creating Medicaid, which provided federal funding for medical insurance to 
Americans living in poverty. For some old and poor people, the resulting Medicare 
and Medicaid legislation enabled the fi rst visit to a medical doctor in their lives. 
Even though there was not a lot of pressure to reform the nation’s immigration 
laws in the 1960s, Johnson was determined to make immigration reform a part of 
the Great Society. The highly restrictive laws of 1921 and 1923 drastically limited 
immigration, virtually cutting off anyone from eastern Europe, Africa, or Asia 
(see Chapter 19 ) . Pressure for change came from New York Representative Emanuel 
Celler who had tried and failed to get an exception to the old and restrictive “national 
origin” quotas so that Jews could fl ee Nazi Germany and who was now determined to 
change the law (see Chapter 23 ) . 
The Immigration Act of 1965 abolished the old quotas though it hardly made 
immigration easy. Th e legislation held the total number of immigrants at 290,000 (the 
number who were expected annually under the old law), but established priorities for 
education and skills rather than national origin. Th e law also provided an important 
loophole, allowing immigration above the new quota for close relatives of U.S. citizens, 
including foreigners who married a citizen. Although little change was expected 
when the legislation was signed, the new immigration law represented the beginning 
of a signifi cant new era of immigration, one that matched and then exceeded the number 
of immigrants who came to the United States from 1890 to 1920. 
Th e fourth major piece of legislation that Congress enacted in 1965 was the Voting 
Rights Act. As 1965 began, Johnson did not have additional civil rights legislation on 
his agenda. Th e Civil Rights Act of 1964 was the most signifi cant Congressional intervention 
in civil rights since Reconstruction. Johnson wanted to focus in 1965 on other 
aspects of his Great Society and did not relish another round of confl ict with Richard 
Russell and other southern Senators. Civil rights leaders, however, did not mean to 
take a back seat to anyone else’s agenda. 
Martin Luther King, Jr., decided to create a national confrontation around the 
right to vote (see Chapter 25 ) . Th e 1964 Civil Rights Act banned segregation in public 
accommodations and the use of federal funds for any segregated institution, but it did 
not address the right to vote. In many parts of the Deep South, more than 90 percent 
of blacks were kept off the voting rolls. As they had for decades, county voting registrars 
used literacy tests and other techniques to make it extremely hard for a black 
person to register to vote, and, as Fannie Lou Hammer’s eloquent testimony at the 
1964 Democratic convention showed, when legal techniques failed, outright violence 
was used. Th e Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party may not have gotten seated at 
that 1964 convention, but they had made an impression on many Americans. King and 
the SCLC were determined to keep the issue of the vote for African-Americans alive. 
When they selected Selma, Alabama, as the site for a major confrontation, SNCC, 
which had focused on voting rights from its founding, agreed to join. Segregation in 
Selma was rigid, despite the Civil Rights Act. Th e city of 29,000 included 15,000 blacks 
of voting age. Only 355 of those black citizens were registered to vote. 
The demonstrations in Selma, Alabama, and the violent response shocked the 
world. On Sunday, March 7, as the Selma marchers began to cross the Edmund Pettis 
26.1

Bridge, sheriff ’s deputies charged them on horseback, clubbing people right and left . 
John Lewis, the head of SNCC (and a future member of Congress) was one of several 
people who were knocked unconscious. Pictures of “Bloody Sunday,” as the day 
became known, were shown around the world. Two weeks later, marchers, now protected 
at Johnson’s directive by the Alabama National Guard, finally completed a 
march to the state capital of Montgomery. Th at evening, the marchers happily sang 
“We have overcome.” But the same evening, KKK members followed one of their 
supporters, Viola Liuzzo of Detroit, as she drove black marchers home from the event, 
and killed her. Th e country had had enough of this sort of violence. 
Only a week aft er the Bloody Sunday march, Johnson went before Congress to give 
one of his most memorable speeches. He told Congress and the nation: 
Th is time, on this issue, there must be no delay, no hesitation, and no compromise 
with our purpose.…Because it is not just Negroes, but really it is all of us 
who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And we shall 
overcome. 
Hearing the fi rst president from the South since the Civil War speak uncompromisingly 
of the right to vote while using the words of the civil rights movement’s hymn 
moved many to tears. 
The Voting Rights Act, which with unrelenting pressure from Johnson passed 
Congress by overwhelming majorities, gave the U.S. Department of Justice the right 
to intervene in any county where 50 percent or fewer of the eligible voters were 
registered—virtually all of the Deep South. Agents could monitor literacy or other tests 
and if necessary appoint new federal registrars. On August 6, 1965, Johnson signed 
the law in the same room where Lincoln had signed the Emancipation Proclamation 
102 years earlier (see Map 26-2 ).

With the Voting Rights Act, the Immigration Act, Medicare and Medicaid, and 
the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, and a host of other measures, Johnson 
was doing what he knew how to do best, getting federal legislation, federal money, and 
federal enforcement powers to address specifi c issues. He was certainly not without 
his critics. Many worried that the education funds were being used to expand already 
bloated school bureaucracies. Medicare and Medicaid seemed to be a huge new federal 
program that would eventually bankrupt the country. Th e Civil Rights and Voting 
Rights Acts, though popular, also created disaff ection with Johnson and the Democratic 
Party that would, as Johnson knew, turn many southerners into Republicans. 
Johnson’s own personality was also a problem. Although he was a master of legislation 
and gave some of the most memorable speeches of any president, he was also a very diffi - 
cult person. He could be crude and cruel, especially to those closest to him. George Reedy, 
who served as Johnson’s Press Secretary and saw him close up, said, “[A]s a human being 
he was a miserable person—a bully, sadist, lout, and egoist.…[H]is lapses from civilized 
conduct were deliberate and usually intended to subordinate someone else do to his will.” 
Such behavior might be eff ective when arm twisting was the only way to get a bill through 
Congress, but they also left precious little reservoir of good will when Johnson got into 
trouble. Aft er 1965, Johnson got into a lot of trouble, especially in foreign policy. 
Refl ecting on the Johnson administration, Averill Harriman, a senior adviser to 
every president from Roosevelt to Johnson, said, “LBJ was great in domestic aff airs.… 
[I]f it hadn’t been for…Vietnam he’d have been the greatest President ever.” In analyses 
of the Johnson presidency, “If it hadn’t been for Vietnam” is a steady refrain. 
Th e war in Vietnam destroyed national support for Johnson and the Great Society. 
Th e war divided Americans as no war since the Civil War. Opposition to and support 
for the war created a new political divide within the country and destroyed many 
long-standing allegiances. Cynicism about the conduct of the war became cynicism 
about government itself and eventually all authorities. Th e war cost 58,000 American 
lives, and many thousands more were wounded in body and mind in the turmoil of 
Vietnam. Whatever one’s ultimate judgments about the U.S. eff ort in Vietnam, it is 
impossible to understand the history of the United States in the late 1960s and beyond 
without understanding the impact of that war. 
Vietnam 
Kennedy’s foreign policy priorities were Cuba and Berlin. Until the final weeks of 
his life, he did not pay a lot of attention to Vietnam. When Kennedy became president, 
the United States had less than 1,000 troops in Vietnam, sent to train the South 
Vietnamese army. Slowly, JFK authorized small increases not only to train troops but 
also to join them on combat missions against infi ltrators from the North Vietnamese 
Army (NVA) and their allied South Vietnamese insurgents organized as the National 
Liberation Front (NLF). So called counterinsurgency and strategic hamlet programs 
were designed to fi nd and destroy enemy forces. Unfortunately the violence of these 
missions and the corruption of the South Vietnamese regime under the leadership 
of the increasingly despotic Ngo Dinh Diem undermined popular support. Diem 
was part of a Catholic elite minority in a country where the majority was Buddhist. 
Although his Christianity and his anti-Communism made him an appealing fi gure in 
the United States, his despotic and corrupt administration alienated many Vietnamese. 
In the summer of 1963, fierce protests were mounted within South Vietnam 
against the Diem regime. Quang Duc, a Buddhist monk, burned himself to death 
on June 11 to protest conditions, and more protests and self-immolations followed. 
Kennedy’s new ambassador to Vietnam, Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr., lost all faith in Diem 
and, with Kennedy’s tacit agreement, supported a military coup against Diem. Th e 
CIA-backed coup took place on November 1, and Diem and his brother were killed, 
something Kennedy had not necessarily expected. And then, 3 weeks later, Kennedy 
was dead, and some 17,000 U.S. military “advisers” were in Vietnam.

As he became president, LBJ wanted to use the offi ce to focus on domestic policy. 
From the beginning, however, he felt he could not ignore Vietnam, and like Kennedy, 
Eisenhower, and Truman, he insisted, “I am not going to be the President who saw 
Southeast Asia go the way China went [to communism].” It was a fateful vow. Equally 
fateful was the fact that, on balance, Johnson himself was as insecure about foreign 
policy as he was secure about domestic policy. Winning a war was a very diff erent 
thing from getting Congress to pass a bill. LBJ kept Kennedy’s foreign policy advisers, 
and most of them were convinced that communism had to be contained around the 
globe. If communist North Vietnam threatened noncommunist South Vietnam, then, 
they believed, the United States needed to protect the noncommunist south, however 
unpalatable the fi ght might be. 
Plans for expanding the war were on Johnson’s desk from the day he became president 
and, although he eventually implemented them, he did delay expanding the U.S. 
involvement in Vietnam (see Map 26-3 ). He wanted to defeat Barry Goldwater in the 
1964 elections, and part of his strategy was to paint Goldwater as a crazy warmonger. 
He also wanted to get the Great Society legislation through Congress. Even so, Johnson 
said in retrospect, “I knew from the start that I was bound to be crucifi ed either way I 
moved. If I left the woman I really loved—the Great Society—in order to get involved 
with that bitch of a war on the other side of the world, then I would lose everything at 
home.…But if I left that war and let the Communists take over South Vietnam, then I 
would be seen as a coward and my nation would be seen as an appeaser.” 
Johnson convinced himself that being “seen as an appeaser” in Vietnam would lead 
to new Soviet and Chinese aggression elsewhere, just as appeasement with Germany 
had led to World War II. He was intimidated by the Kennedy legacy of toughness in 
foreign policy and was convinced that, if he did not fi nd a way to save South Vietnam, 
“There would be Robert Kennedy out in front leading the fight against me, telling 
everyone that I had betrayed John Kennedy’s commitment to South Vietnam.…that I 
was a coward.” For a Texan who had grown up on stories of the heroes of the Alamo, 
being called a coward was simply beyond contemplation. Johnson’s fear proved to 
be ironic since, 4 years later, Robert Kennedy would run as an antiwar candidate 
against Johnson. 
Th roughout 1964, LBJ increased the military advisers modestly, from 17,000 to 
23,000, but he did all he could to keep Vietnam off of the front pages in the election 
year aft er the 1963 CIA-backed coup in South Vietnam. Th e one big exception came 
on August 1, when there were reports that a North Vietnamese torpedo boat fi red on 
the U.S. destroyer Maddox, Johnson ordered an immediate military response. Johnson 
also went to Congress and asked for a resolution granting him the right to use “all necessary 
measures” to repel any attacks against the U.S. forces in Vietnam. Th e Gulf of 
Tonkin Resolution passed easily—unanimously in the House and with only two dissenting 
votes in the Senate—and in later years, it was this resolution, rather than any 
further congressional action, that presidents Johnson and Nixon used to prosecute 
the war. Only years later did historians discover that there was no solid evidence that 
anything had been fi red at the Maddox, or a second destroyer that had come to aid it, 
during the August encounter, but Johnson got the power he wanted. 
After Johnson’s inauguration in January 1965, the military situation in South 
Vietnam deteriorated badly—North Vietnamese forces controlled perhaps half 
the land and people of the south. Johnson’s key foreign policy advisers, especially 
Secretary of State Dean Rusk and Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, urged a 
major escalation of U.S. involvement. Some, especially Undersecretary of State George 
Ball, opposed escalation but, in early 1965, most were calling for more troops. 
In February 1965, Johnson said, “I can’t ask our American soldiers out there to 
continue to fi ght with one hand tied behind their backs,” and launched a major bombing 
campaign against North Vietnam to stop the fl ow of supplies to the south. As the 
bombing expanded—3,600 runs in April, 4,800 by June—the United States also sent 
more ground forces to protect the American air base at Danang. Once there, these

troops also engaged in battle and then needed more troops to support them. Fift ythousand 
troops were in Vietnam by April of 1965, and the number rose to 75,000 by 
midsummer. By July, Secretary McNamara, noting that the bombing alone was not 
defeating the northern forces, urged that the U.S. troop strength be increased from 
75,000 to more than 200,000. Johnson agreed. But he did not want to go to Congress 
for authorization, fearing that it would disrupt the Great Society legislation. So he quietly 
asked for an additional appropriation for the war and announced a troop increase 
at a midday news conference devoted to other issues. Th e result was that although 
Johnson won short-term success for his domestic programs, he planted the seeds of 
long-term distrust. 
For the next 2 years, combat in Vietnam expanded. Eventually, half a million U.S. 
troops were in Vietnam. Numbers at that level could be sustained only by an increased

military draft . Deferments became diffi cult to get, especially for minority and working-
class men. Casualty numbers also grew, undermining morale among the troops 
and at home. Costs mushroomed. In 1965, the military budget was $49.6 billion; by 
1968, it was $80.5 billion. Try as they might, the U.S. commanders could not get the 
South Vietnamese army to play a major role in the war. Th ey avoided battle when they 
could and seemed to have an uncanny way of knowing where danger was and leaving 
those sites to the Americans. 
As U.S. soldiers did more of the fi ghting, they also saw less purpose to what they 
were doing. Troops went out on search-and-destroy missions, and then came back to 
their bases with little to show other than a list of enemy soldiers killed. One soldier 
asked, “What am I doing here? We don’t take any land.…We just mutilate bodies.” An 
American offi cer, speaking of his company’s attack on the village of Ben Tre, which was 
suspected of harboring NLF supporters, said, “We had to destroy the village in order 
to save it.” Destroying villages to “save” them, marching into the jungle, engaging in 
battles with enemy forces—battles that the U.S. troops almost always won—but then 
coming back to their bases while the enemy forces reorganized in the jungle were strategies 
that seemed pointless to most soldiers. Th e U.S. commander in Vietnam, General 
William Westmoreland, kept providing optimistic reports. Few were convinced. 
Racial tensions oft en exploded in Vietnam. In 1965, 12.6 percent of the troops 
were black but 24 percent of combat deaths were of black soldiers. Black soldiers, 
who knew that civil rights workers were being killed in Alabama and Mississippi at 
home, believed that they were oft en being sent on the most dangerous missions. Many 
became increasingly angry at their fellow troops, at their offi cers, and at the war.

I’m tired of trying to rationalize things in my mind. All my 
beliefs seem to form a giant paradox. There is no room in my 
heart to justify killing, I can’t ever justify the training to kill, and 
yet I can’t justify copping out. I can’t justify desertion although 
that seems the only logical course of action. I know inside that a 
time is drawing near when our families will need to draw together 
and the world will be in an uproar, so leaving for another country 
is out. The church speaks so loudly against breaking the law, and 
so loudly for supporting our constituted way of life that I can’t 
justify refusing my orders. I want to do what is called of me for 
my country, but I can’t justify the senseless loss of life. . . . But with 
every day I become more conscious of the ominous power we’ve 
given the military, and hate it so much more. . . .

While morale disintegrated on the ground in Vietnam, public support for the war 
also evaporated. By launching the war quietly, Johnson had not built public support. 
Many Americans had a natural tendency to support the president and the troops at 
fi rst, but that support declined rapidly. Vietnam was the nation’s fi rst televised war. 
Television did not actually show a lot of combat; many of the battles were at night or 
far from cameras. Nevertheless, footage of troops going into combat as well as pictures 
of dead and wounded American soldiers brought the war into American living 
rooms. Lack of clear progress created doubt. Opposition to the war built with each 
news report, each draft call, and each casualty list. 
While critics have rightly pointed out that no more than 20 percent of college students 
took part in antiwar demonstrations, and those demonstrations were mostly 
on elite campuses such as the University of California at Berkeley, Columbia, and 
Harvard, few campuses anywhere were untouched by antiwar fervor, especially as 
many students worried about draft calls or felt the guilt at being protected by their student 
status while friends went off to Vietnam. As the war escalated, those participating 
in campus-based teach-ins—gatherings at which experts or better informed students 
taught others about Vietnam—heard mostly from critics of the war. Th e fi rst March 
on Washington to end the war took place in April 1965. At that rally, 25,000 people 
heard SDS president Paul Potter say, “Th e incredible war in Vietnam has provided 
the razor, the terrifyingly sharp cutting edge that has fi nally severed the last vestige of 
illusion that morality and democracy are the guiding principles of American foreign 
policy.” In 1966, 1967, and 1968, the teach-ins became angrier and the disaff ection 
with the government greater. As early as 1966, demonstrators were not only calling 
for American withdrawal from Vietnam but also waving NLF fl ags and chanting, “Ho, 
Ho Ho Chi Minh, Th e NLF is gonna win.” 
Students were far from the only opponents of the war. Th e Women’s Strike for 
Peace, the Fellowship of Reconciliation, and the Catholic Worker Movement were 
pacifist organizations who had opposed the war from the beginning. In addition, 
more religious leaders began to speak out about the specifi c war in Vietnam. Catholic 
priests Daniel and Philip Berrigan and Henry Sloan Coffi n, the Protestant chaplain at 
Yale University, became leading antiwar activists. 
Established civil rights groups did not want to risk a break with the Johnson 
administration when LBJ was doing so much to support civil rights. Even so, SNCC 
African-American troops in Vietnam who bore a disproportional share of the fi ghting and dying quickly lost 
faith in the eff ort.

was the fi rst among them to oppose the war. A 1966 SNCC position paper attacked a 
war “to preserve a ‘democracy’ which does not exist at home.” In April 1967, Martin 
Luther King, Jr., stood in the pulpit at New York’s Riverside Church to tell the civil 
rights movement and the nation that he had come to see that the war was sending 
poor and black Americans 8,000 miles away to fi ght for rights that they did not have in 
the United States. “Somehow this madness must cease,” he pleaded. 
As the war continued, some opponents took their opposition to a new level. When 
some 35,000 demonstrators surrounded the Pentagon and tried to disrupt daily business 
in Washington in October 1967, the government reacted harshly with mass 
arrests of the protestors. Between 50,000 and 100,000 young men left the United 
States, most of them moving to Canada, to avoid serving in a war they thought was 
wrong. Many of those who moved to Canada eventually returned to the United States, 
especially aft er presidential pardons granted by presidents Ford and Carter, but some 
50,000 Americans became permanent residents of Canada as a result of the Vietnam 
War while others stayed in neutral nations like Sweden. 
In 1967, a group of young men in San Francisco announced that they were staying 
in the United States but refusing to cooperate with the military draft in any way. “We 
will renounce all deferments and refuse to cooperate with the draft in any manner, at 
any level,” they said. Draft resistance, and a willingness to be arrested for the act, was a 
new stage in the protest movement. Later, Dr. Benjamin Spock (whose book on child 
care had been the bible for the parents of many of those now refusing the draft ) and 
Rev. William Sloan Coffi n were arrested for urging draft resistance. 
Still others took their protests to other forms of direct action to try to stop the war. 
In May 1969, opponents of the war, including some religious leaders, walked into the 
offi ces of Dow Chemical Company, which made the napalm jelly that was used to 
burn, kill, and maim in Vietnam, and poured blood into fi ling cabinets and on offi ce 
equipment to disrupt the workings of the offi ces. 
While opposition to the war in Vietnam broadened, Johnson isolated himself with 
trusted advisers. He agonized about casualty reports, wept while signing letters of condolence 
to those who had lost a loved one in the war, and regularly got up at 4:00 and 
5:00 a.m. to check on casualty fi gures. He never seriously considered changing course and 
stopped talking to those who suggested that he should. He authorized the CIA, which was 
only supposed to operate abroad, to spy on American antiwar leaders who he became convinced 
were communists, and he authorized the FBI to infi ltrate and disrupt the antiwar 
movement. Johnson brought the army commander in Vietnam, General Westmoreland, 
to Washington, DC, in November 1967 to tell Americans that there was “light at the end 
of the tunnel” in Vietnam. By that time, fewer Americans were convinced. 
1968 
In 1968, the growing tensions of war, race, and change in America seemed to explode. 
Few were untouched by the anger and fear that the year provoked. 
Two months after General Westmoreland’s optimistic assessment, the light at 
the end of the tunnel in Vietnam dimmed considerably. On January 30, 1968, the 
fi rst day of Tet, the Vietnamese lunar new year, North Vietnamese and NLF forces 
attacked everywhere across South Vietnam, all at once. Th ey blew a hole in the wall 
surrounding the American embassy in Saigon and came close to getting into the inner 
compound. Th ey attacked the distant Marine post at Khe Sanh. Th ey took control 
of the old Vietnamese capital city of Hue. And they attacked American and South 
Vietnamese forces all over the country. Eventually, the Tet Offensive was beaten 
back, at terrible cost to the North Vietnamese. By one estimate, the North lost 40,000 
troops compared to 2,300 South Vietnamese and 1,100 Americans. Even so, the North 
had won an important victory. Public trust in Westmoreland and Johnson was never 
restored. Th e president and the general had said that the United States was winning 
the war, but now it certainly looked like it was losing. Johnson’s popularity dropped

from its already low 40 percent approval rating to 26 percent. Walter Cronkite, the 
anchor of the CBS Evening News and perhaps the most trusted journalist in the country, 
who had maintained careful neutrality in his reporting, traveled to Vietnam aft er 
Tet and returned to tell his viewers, “It seems more certain than ever that the bloody 
experience of Vietnam is to end in a stalemate.” Many agreed. 
When Westmoreland responded to the Tet offensive by asking for even more 
troops, beyond the 525,000 Americans already in Vietnam, Johnson’s new Secretary 
of Defense told the president, “We seem to have a sinkhole.…I see more and more 
fi ghting with more and more casualties on the U.S. side and no end in sight to the 
action.” Secretary of State Rusk, long a supporter of the war, recommended a bombing 
halt and an off er of negotiations with North Vietnam. Johnson hated the advice, 
but he could no longer ignore it. 
At the same time, Johnson’s lack of popularity was catching up with him. Everyone 
assumed that, as an incumbent president, Johnson would seek and easily win his party’s 
nomination for another term in offi ce. But the antiwar mood was growing, in the country 
and in the Democratic Party. On March 12, 1968, in the nation’s fi rst primary vote in 
New Hampshire, Minnesota Senator Eugene McCarthy, who had become a strong opponent 
of the war, won 42 percent of the votes against LBJ’s 49 percent. Many who had 
participated in antiwar demonstrations decided to be “clean for Gene” and campaign 
door to door in New Hampshire. Th ey found a ready electorate, people of many diff erent 
persuasions, including those who were fed up with the seemingly endless war and those 
who were frustrated because LBJ seemed unwilling either to commit the force needed to 
win or to withdraw. Th e New Hampshire vote was far too close for a sitting president. 
Even worse than the challenge from McCarthy, at least from Johnson’s perspective, 
was one from New York Senator Robert Kennedy, whom Johnson loathed. Bobby 
Kennedy realized that McCarthy’s win could mean LBJ’s defeat for the nomination 
and that, since McCarthy had opened the way, it was a good time to challenge an 
incumbent of his own party. While McCarthy was little-known, Bobby was perhaps 
the best known politician in the country. Soon aft er the New Hampshire vote, Kennedy 
announced that he was entering the contest. For many who opposed the war, wanted 
further social change, and dreamed of a return to the glory days of the JFK presidency, 
Bobby’s 1968 campaign was a dream come true. His campaign struck an emotional 
chord among both supporters and opponents—seldom seen in American politics. 
On March 31, 1968, just weeks after the New Hampshire vote, Johnson gave a 
nationally televised speech. He announced plans to reduce the bombing as “the fi rst step 
to deescalate the confl ict.” He called on Ho Chi Minh to “respond positively and favorably 
to this new step for peace.” Th en he surprised the country, perhaps himself, by adding, 
“I shall not seek, and will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term 
as your president.” Johnson, the ultimate politician, knew that public trust was essential 
to govern. And by March 1968, he had lost that trust. North Vietnam did respond, and 
the road to peace had begun. It would be a long and painful road, however, one that 
would last far beyond the end of Johnson’s term. Johnson’s career and his hopes for the 
country had become casualties of Vietnam—though very far from the only casualties. 
Four days aft er Johnson’s surprise announcement, Martin Luther King, Jr., was 
shot and killed in Memphis, Tennessee, where he was supporting a strike by the city’s 
garbage collectors. With the murder of King, the leading spokesperson for nonviolence, 
many felt that the cause of nonviolence itself had been damaged. Riots erupted 
all over America. Police arrested 20,000 people in 130 cities in the week following 
King’s assassination. Forty-six people, 41 of them black, were killed. Urban America 
seemed to be coming unglued. 
Th e riots that followed King’s death refl ected the deep anger in much of the African- 
American community. In Oakland, California, Huey Newton and Bobby Seale had 
founded the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense in 1966. Newton and Seale insisted that 
urban police forces had become occupying armies in the black community. Following a 
26.3 
26.2 
26.1 

Chapter 26 Lives Changed 821 
California law then in place allowing unconcealed weapons, the Panthers 
conducted their own armed patrols of Oakland as a defense. Such an 
armed presence, however, almost assured violence. A 17-old Panther, 
Bobby Hutton, was killed the same month as King. Many more Panthers 
would be killed in subsequent years. Th e Panthers always remained a tiny 
fringe group, as popular for swagger as for their breakfast programs and 
their commitment to armed self-defense. Even so, while small, they were 
a symbol that many blacks embraced a move away from the self-sacrifi cing 
nonviolence of King to a more angry and militant stance. 
Two weeks after King’s death and the urban riots, students at 
Columbia University, led by the SDS chapter, took over the president’s 
offi ce and refused to leave. Four buildings were held by white students 
and a fi ft h building, separately, by black students. Th e Columbia sit-in 
was a protest over the university’s war-related research and a university 
plan to build a new gymnasium in the park that separated the university 
from Harlem. In addition, it refl ected far-reaching anger toward 
all authorities. Aft er 8 days, the university administration called on the 
police to clear the buildings and they did. The violence of the police 
move onto the campus—during which more than a hundred demonstrators 
were injured—also pointed to the deep fault lines in the 
nation. The mostly working-class white police were furious at the 
white students whom they considered privileged snobs. The student 
revolt at Columbia was one of many. Students protesting the war or 
local issues took over buildings, held mass rallies, disrupted classes, 
and burned war-related research materials on more than 150 campuses 
in the 1968–69 academic year. 
In the face of this violent, some said crazy, time in American history, Bobby 
Kennedy continued his campaign for the presidency. On June 5, Kennedy won the 
California Democratic Primary. It was the capstone to his campaign. He not only 
championed the antiwar cause, but befriended César Chavez of the Farm Workers 
Union, rural whites in Appalachia, Puerto Rican immigrants living in New York City, 
American Indians on isolated reservations, and urban blacks in city aft er city, as no 
candidate had ever done. Then, only moments after his California victory speech, 
Kennedy was shot by an Arab nationalist. He died days later. As with King, many 
hopes died with Kennedy. 
When the Democratic Party convention fi nally took place in Chicago in August 
1968, Kennedy was dead. The McCarthy campaign had been sidelined. The party 
nominated Hubert Humphrey, LBJ’s loyal vice president who had not entered a single 
primary. Humphrey had long been a darling of the liberal wing of the party, but his 
silence on Vietnam and his steadfast loyalty to the increasingly unpopular Johnson 
meant that he had lost the trust of many. 
While the convention met to hear speeches and act on the nomination, protests 
erupted inside and outside the convention hall. Many delegates protested on the fl oor 
of the convention itself. Huge demonstrations were also planned for Chicago during 
convention week by demonstrators who had their own divisions. One faction, led by 
long-time pacifi st David Dellinger, wanted a nonviolent but militant protest against the 
war, LBJ, and Humphrey. Another group, for whom Tom Hayden and Rennie Davis of 
the SDS were the most prominent, wanted a more direct confrontation that they knew 
might provoke police violence. Finally, a group who called themselves Yippies, led by 
Abbie Hoff man and Jerry Rubin, believed that the best way to protest was to make fun 
of the Democrats and the Chicago police in every way possible. 
Chicago’s mayor Richard Daley was determined to quash all demonstrations. As the convention 
met, the police attacked the demonstrators with tear gas and billy clubs in the glare of 
television cameras. Th ey attacked delegates. Th ey attacked the press. Nationally known reporters

Black Panther Party founders Huey P. Newton and Bobby Seale. The 
Panthers advocated a radical economic, social, and educational agenda 
that made it the target of a determined campaign of suppression and 
elimination by the police and the FBI.

Dan Rather and Mike Wallace were both roughed up. As 
crowds chanted, “Th e whole world is watching,” the violence 
in Chicago was broadcast around the world. One 
McCarthy delegate described what he saw from his hotel 
window, “Cops chased kids off into the park and out of 
sight among the trees, emerged with one cop dragging a 
boy or girl by the leg and another cop running alongside 
clubbing in the groin. A man tried to carry a bleeding 
woman into the hotel, and they were both clubbed and 
thrown into the wagon.” 
In the aft ermath of the convention, a commission 
appointed to investigate what had happened 
described it as a “police riot.” Th e fact that this could 
happen, with “the whole world watching,” represented 
how deeply divided Americans were in 1968. 
The November 1968 presidential election presented 
three choices. First was Hubert Humphrey 
and his vice presidential nominee, Maine Senator 
Edmund Muskie, a ticket that barely seemed to limp 
out of the Chicago convention. Humphrey said later, “My wife and I went home heartbroken, 
battered, and beaten.” But there were two other contenders in the 1968 race. 
In addition, Governor George Wallace of Alabama, who had made his name 
blocking school integration had launched a strong third-party campaign in 1968. To 
the surprise of many, he qualifi ed for the ballot in all 50 states. Wallace and his running 
mate, Air Force General Curtis LeMay, seemed to have broad support, ranging 
from the most conservative groups in the country—including the KKK and the John 
Birch Society—to the many white southerners opposed to racial integration to many 
in the North who were appalled by riots and antiwar demonstrations. With comments 
like, “If any demonstrator every lays down in front of my car, it’ll be the last car he’ll 
every lay down in front of,” Wallace courted what he called the “law and order” vote. 
Th ird, the Republican Party emerged from its summer convention as united as the 
Democrats were divided. Richard M. Nixon, who had lost to John Kennedy in 1960, 
spent the intervening 8 years quietly laying the ground work for a political comeback. 
He collected many political debts and cashed them all in to win the 1968 nomination 
on the fi rst ballot. His running mate was Maryland Governor Spiro Agnew, who 
had once been seen as a liberal but who, especially aft er the Baltimore riots following 
King’s death, had become a voice of white backlash against what he called the “circuit-
riding, Hanoi-visiting, caterwauling, riot-inciting, burn-America-down” types in 
the black and white community. Nixon announced a “secret plan” to end the war in 
Vietnam and otherwise ran a carefully scripted, television-savvy, and very expensive 
campaign. Th e Republicans outspent the Democrats almost two to one. 
In early fall, it seemed as if Nixon was unstoppable, in spite of Wallace’s popularity. 
Nixon’s major theme “Working Americans have become the forgotten Americans,” 
his promise to do something diff erent in Vietnam (no one knew what), and his success 
in representing anti-Johnson sentiment without getting specifi c all worked in his 
favor. An early poll gave him 43 percent of the vote to Humphrey’s 28 percent and 
Wallace’s 21 percent. Humphrey, however, ran a surprisingly strong campaign. He 
tried to repair the Democratic coalition, distanced himself from Johnson, and reached 
out to his longtime supporters. At the same time, Nixon struck some as too smooth, 
and a vote for Wallace seemed a wasted vote. By election day, the polls said the race 
between Humphrey and Nixon was too close to call. 
Nixon won the November election, by a close vote of 37.7 million to 37.1 million, 
while Wallace took almost 10 million votes. Nixon’s electoral college lead was greater: 
301 to 191. Th e Democrats retained both houses of Congress, however. Humphrey

won 97 percent of the black vote but only 35 percent of the white vote. Between them, 
Nixon and Wallace had won 57 percent of all of the votes, a significant backlash 
against Johnson’s huge 1964 victory, against the war, and against the demonstrators 
who opposed it. In 1968, Americans were more deeply divided by race and class and 
region than they had been in many years, and anything approaching national consensus 
was a distant dream. Th e election results also showed that Vietnam would remain 
an unsolved issue for a new administration. 
Quick Review How did the war in Vietnam impact Great Society programs, the Johnson 
presidency, and the country? 
CONCLUSION 
In contrast to the 1950s, which represented a time of relative stability and complacency 
for some Americans, the 1960s ushered in a period of intense activism and social 
upheaval that in one way or another touched most. Writers and artists began to criticize 
almost all aspects of American culture and helped set in motion the modern ecological 
conservation movement, the feminist movement, a new focus on poverty, and 
a vocal antiwar movement. Perhaps the most iconic of these movements was the student 
movement. In 1960, a small group of students formed Students for a Democratic 
Society, which sought to end war, racial injustice, and economic inequality. In its early 
years, members of that organization engaged in marches, protests, and other forms of 
direct action to counter government policies inconsistent with their stated mission. 
Despite increasing social activism across the nation, President John F. Kennedy 
remained concerned more with foreign than domestic issues. President Kennedy and 
his wife Jacqueline Kennedy brought youth, charm, and energy to the White House. 
Although Kennedy achieved some domestic victories, he was preoccupied, to a large 
extent, with Cuba, Germany—especially Berlin—and the Soviet Union. Aft er the failed 
Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961, Cuban ties to Russia grew. Th e Soviets sent military personnel 
to the Caribbean island, and in 1962, the Russians began building bases in Cuba 
for housing missiles capable of reaching the United States. A clash between the United 
States and the Soviet Union seemed inevitable, but the two nations reached an agreement 
that resolved the crisis and thereby avoided a potentially cataclysmic confrontation. 
In November 1963, Kennedy was assassinated and Lyndon Johnson became president. 
Unlike his predecessor, Johnson attempted to focus more on domestic rather 
than on foreign policy issues and, in fact, was remarkably successful in advancing his 
domestic policy goals, which he called the Great Society. During his tenure, Congress 
passed the Civil Rights Act, a new immigration law, and the Voting Rights Act, as well 
as created Medicare and Medicaid health insurance and greatly expanded federal aid 
to education and the poor. Still, Vietnam was a lingering problem. As Johnson steadily 
increased U.S. involvement in Vietnam, opposition to the war intensifi ed at home. 
In 1968, mounting tensions in American society exploded. In the midst of the violence, 
at home and abroad, Johnson announced that he would not seek another term as 
president. Four days aft erward, Martin Luther King, Jr., was assassinated and race riots 
broke out across the country. Two months later, Robert Kennedy was shot and killed. 
At the 1968 Democratic Party convention, protests erupted outside the convention hall, 
and the police attacked demonstrators as well as onlookers in what was later called a 
“police riot.” While the Democratic Party was fracturing, the Republican Party seemed 
strong. Nevertheless, the presidential race of 1968 was a very close one. Th e tumultuous 
year ended with the election of Republican candidate Richard Nixon to the presidency. 
The 1960s have been seen as a decade of protests. What evidence would you 
give for or against that assumption? How did the focus and tone of protests 
change from the early to the late 1960s?

NEW VOICES, NEW AUTHORITIES 
Explain the growing social protest in books, fi lms, and student 
movements starting in the early 1960s. 
Summary 
The 1960s saw widespread challenges to the conformity of 
the 1950s. Writers and artists produced works that reflected 
and shaped a rapidly changing culture. Writers challenged 
conventional thinking on a wide variety of public policy issues, 
including city planning, the environment, and poverty. Social 
critics questioned gender roles, the American class structure, 
and racial hierarchies. Politics made its way into popular 
films and music, although a great deal of popular entertainment 
remained traditional and uncontroversial. At the same 
time, protest movements, oft en led by college students, articulated 
the viewpoint of a new generation and suggested the 
direction of further changes in American life. Th e number of 
American college students grew dramatically in the 1950s and 
1960s, and colleges and universities themselves grew to keep 
up with demand. Student activism focused on free speech, gender 
issues, civil rights for minorities, and, above all else, the 
Vietnam War.

CAMELOT, THE WHITE HOUSE, AND DALLAS—THE 
KENNEDY ADMINISTRATION 
Analyze the successes and failures of the Kennedy administration 
and how they interacted with popular culture in the United 
States. 
Summary 
Despite John F. Kennedy’s popular image, the Kennedy administration 
had surprisingly few legislative victories and gave a 
higher priority to foreign policy than domestic concerns. While 
civil rights advocates had high hopes for the Kennedy administration, 
Kennedy pursued a cautious course, launching few 
initiatives, at the same time being careful not to alienate southern 
members of Congress or to get too far ahead of American 
public opinion. While the Kennedy administration made some 
gains in other areas of domestic concern, his overall record is 
more notable for its inactivity than for its accomplishments. 
Kennedy was as reluctant to engage with the issue of religion in 
American life as he was to grapple with civil rights. Nonetheless, 
a series of Supreme Court rulings established a sharper division 
between church and state, angering many Americans in 
the process. In contrast to his passivity on domestic issues, 
Kennedy was committed to taking an active role in fi ghting the 
Cold War. Kennedy’s initial forays into foreign policy were not 
promising. The Bay of Pigs was a fiasco, and Kennedy’s 1961 
summit with Khrushchev did not go well. Th e 1962 Cuban missile 
crisis brought the world to the brink of nuclear war. All in 
all, Kennedy’s foreign policy legacy was mixed. Th e Kennedy 
administration was cut short by the assassination of the president 
in November 1963, which produced a tremendous outpouring 
of public grief. Many Americans were unconvinced by 
the offi cial fi nding that Lee Harvey Oswald was the sole person 
responsible for Kennedy’s death.

THE COMING OF LYNDON B. JOHNSON 
Analyze the successes and failures of the Johnson administration 
in terms of the two issues that dominated his years in 
offi ce—the launching of the Great Society programs and the 
war in Vietnam. 
Summary 
Lyndon Johnson’s childhood experience with poverty and his 
remarkable effectiveness as a member of Congress prepared 
him to advance an ambitious domestic agenda as president. 
Johnson worked closely with Congress to pass landmark civil 
rights legislation, launch a war on poverty, and to implement 
his vision of the “Great Society.” Johnson’s Great Society agenda 
gathered momentum after his landslide victory in 1964. The 
core Great Society legislation of 1965 included federal aid to 
education, Medicare and Medicaid, immigration reform, and 
a Voting Rights Act. As signifi cant as Johnson’s domestic victories 
were, they were undermined by the war in Vietnam. 
Th e war divided the country, destroyed support for Johnson’s 
domestic agenda, and led to widespread cynicism in American 
society about authority in general and government in particular. 
Th e escalation of U.S. involvement in Vietnam began under 
Kennedy. Johnson hesitated at fi rst to further expand the war, 
but became convinced that his political career depended on 
securing victory in Vietnam. With the military situation in 
Vietnam deteriorating rapidly, Johnson began a rapid escalation 
of U.S. troops in Vietnam in the spring of 1965. Increasing the 
U.S. troop presence did not bring victory, and military morale 
declined along with public support for the war. The 1968 Tet 
Offensive destroyed the last vestiges of public confidence in 
Johnson’s conducting of the war, and Johnson decided not to 
seek a second term as president. Th e assassinations of Martin 
Luther King, Jr., and Robert Kennedy plunged the nation into 
even greater uncertainty and unrest. Divisions within the 
Democratic Party, highlighted by the violence at the Democratic 
convention, opened the door for Republican Richard Nixon’s 
victory in the 1968 presidential election.

Widely diverse groups of American began to protest conditions and policies that they 
found intolerable. Among them, members of the American Indian Movement took 
over the closed prison on Alcatraz Island in San Francisco Bay, claiming it as “surplus 
federal land” that rightly belonged to them. 
Basic contradictions in American life came to the surface between 
1968 and 1980. Th e new Republican president, elected thanks to a 
backlash against the unresolved war in Vietnam, initially widened 
the war. Nixon, elected with conservative support, also began a new era of 
relations with Communist China and signed some of the most far-reaching 
social legislation in history. While the civil rights and antiwar movements 
splintered, more Americans began demanding their rights in other areas. A 
women’s movement transformed intimate relationships, the work world, and 
American culture. Th e civil rights campaigns of Latinos, Asians, American 
Indians, gay men, and lesbians also made their impact. 
Public discourse became more divisive and angry aft er 1969. Th e new 
vice president, Spiro T. Agnew, called protesters “nattering nabobs of negativism.” 
A new conservative ideology emerged, built on Barry Goldwater’s 
campaigns but also on cultural issues, which included opposition to the 
Equal Rights Amendment and the growth of a new “religious right.” Before 
the decade was over, the United States was defeated in Vietnam; Richard 
Nixon had resigned in disgrace; his appointed successor, Gerald Ford, was 
defeated in his bid for reelection; and his successor Jimmy Carter was also 
defeated in his reelection attempt. The decade was one that held much 
anger, much sordidness, and few moments of greatness.

THE NEW POLITICS OF THE LATE 1960S Signifi cant Dates 
Explain Nixon’s policies and politics, domestic and international. 
Early in 1969, Kevin Phillips, a special assistant during Richard Nixon’s successful 
presidential campaign, published Th e Emerging Republican Majority . Phillips analyzed 
what he saw as the signifi cance of the election and focused on two major changes in 
American politics. Th e new Republican Party, Phillips said, was based in “the rising 
insurgency of the South, the West, the New York City Irish, and middle-class suburbia.” 
Phillips off ered a detailed statistical analysis to show that the suburbs especially 
were overwhelmingly middle class, white, and Republican. 
Th e elections, as Phillips described them, were a reaction against the Civil Rights 
Movement, which had generated considerable anger in white America and a repudiation 
of Johnson’s Great Society. Expanded government programs and services 
off ended people who wanted small government, who distrusted an intrusive state, and 
who feared racial integration. 
Many found the analysis convincing even though Phillips did not assess the impact 
that the war in Vietnam had on the politics of 1968. Even so, many, including Lyndon 
Johnson, attributed the 1968 Democratic presidential losses to the war. While antiwar 
protesters were furious at Johnson and the Democrats for continuing the war, many 
other Americans were angry that the war was not being won. Anger at antiwar dissidents 
also ran deep. For a substantial number of Americans, celebrations of freedom 
from restraint—political, cultural, and sexual—were abhorrent. 
The Roots of the Conservative Reaction of the 1960s 
While the suburban-based conservatism was new, it was deeply rooted in the early 
development of suburban culture. Some Americans had long disagreed with the direction 
of the country. William F. Buckley’s conservative journal, the National Review 
appeared in 1955. Ayn Rand’s novel Atlas Shrugged appeared in 1957, the themes 
of which argued that any interference with individual rights would destroy human 
freedom. Ministers such as James Fifi eld at the First Congregational Church in Los 
Angeles preached that, “Th e blessings of capitalism come from God.” 
As late as 1960, there were plenty of conservatives and liberals in both parties. 
Aft er the 1960 election, however, the two parties began to move in opposite directions, 
and over time, most liberals moved to the Democratic party while most conservatives 
became Republicans Th e drift toward fairly rigid and uniform positions in 
each party was clear by the late 1960s. In the 1960s and 1970s, the conservative shift 
among Republicans was led by Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater, who emerged as the 
hero of the conservative wing of the Republicans. In his fi rst Senate campaign in 1952, 
Goldwater asked audiences, “Do you believe in expanding federal government?…Do 
you want federal bureaus and federal agencies to take over an ever-increasing portion 
of your life?” If the answer was “no,” then, Goldwater said, he was their man. In 1960, 
he criticized Eisenhower as representing a “dime store New Deal.” He criticized the 
U.S. Supreme Court’s Brown v. Board of Education decision as an unconstitutional 
federal intervention in the rights of states, and he voted against the 1964 Civil Rights 
Act, saying that the race relations issue “is best handled by the people directly concerned.” 
His book, Th e Conscience of a Conservative , published in April 1960, spoke 
to a white middle class that was unhappy with taxes and government intrusion, no 
longer interested in the New Deal safety net, frightened by the Civil Rights Movement, 
and fi ercely anticommunist. It was this conservative movement that took over the 
Republican Party in 1964, even though their hero went down to defeat. 
Four years later in 1968, it was Goldwater’s philosophy, not Eisenhower’s, that 
Richard Nixon used to make his comeback. Nevertheless, Nixon’s actual presidency

contradicted his campaign assertions. Richard Nixon himself was a jumble of insecurities 
and contradictions. His insecurities and his sense that there were many enemies 
about to attack him made it hard for Nixon to build warm personal relationships or 
inspire the broad popularity of presidents like Eisenhower or Kennedy. He isolated 
himself and oft en lied to hide the inner workings of his administration. Even though 
he had been elected as the voice of those who had supported Goldwater, his administration 
would be relatively liberal. Many federal programs were still popular, and 
Nixon was happy to support them and reap the political benefi t even as he attacked 
liberals and liberalism as a way to win yet other voters to his side. 
Nixon Domestic Policies—Liberal Legislation, Conservative Politics 
Although a self-proclaimed conservative, Nixon seemed to some to be a liberal in 
disguise. In July 1969, Nixon led the celebrations when John F. Kennedy’s goal was 
achieved and Neil Armstrong became the fi rst person to walk on the moon, propelled 
there by American technology. In spite of the revulsion against LBJ, the 1968 election 
retained many Great Society Democrats in Congress. Congressional Democrats and 
the Republican president worked together to pass signifi cant legislation. Johnson’s 1965 
Voting Rights Act was renewed in 1970. New federal funds were provided for a “war on 
cancer” and other medical research. Off ended when she heard a group of school superintendents 
dismiss the educational needs of girls, Representative Edith Green of Oregon, 
joined by Representatives Patsy Mink of Hawaii and Shirley Chisholm of New York, proposed 
Title IX, which was added to the Civil Rights Act in 1972, banning sex discrimination 
in higher education—in sports but also in all college and university activities, and 
Nixon signed the law. Funds for Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security were increased. 
Federal affi rmative action regulations were toughened by Nixon’s Department of Labor. 
Nixon did much more than any of his predecessors to strengthen environmental 
protection. While the Kennedy and Johnson administrations had pressed passage of 
the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and Endangered Species Act, it was under Nixon 
that the new cabinet-level Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was created as well 
as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Th e 1973 Endangered 
Species Act expanded protection for animals and plants. New Clean Air and Clean 
Water acts mandated the cleanup of polluted areas without regard to the cost. 
Nixon also approved government support of arts and culture, particularly regional 
art programs and folk art. When Nixon took offi ce, the annual budget of the National 
Endowment for the Arts (NEA) was $7.7 million. Many worried that Nixon, who had 
never shown any appreciation of art, would cut the budget, but he proposed increases 
each year. By the time he left offi ce, the NEA budget was over $60 million, almost a 
10-fold increase. 
Nixon championed the Family Assistance Plan (FAP) that was designed by Daniel 
Moynihan—then a Nixon policy adviser and later a Democratic senator. It would have 
replaced Aid to Families with Dependent Children (known simply as “welfare” to most) 
with a guaranteed annual income. FAP was defeated by a combination of liberals who 
thought it did not provide enough money to people in poverty and by conservatives who 
thought it expanded government handouts. Nixon also proposed a system of federally 
mandated health insurance, the only Republican to do so. Overall federal spending for 
people in poverty rose by some 50 percent, and total federal spending for social insurance 
(which always includes more middle-class than poor benefi ciaries) rose from $27.3 billion 
in the year Nixon took offi ce to $64.7 billion at the time of his second inauguration. 
It is impossible to call anyone who presided over such spending a conservative. 
Nixon could be seen as the last of the New Deal presidents, and many Goldwater 
conservatives saw him that way and were furious with him. From Nixon’s perspective, 
the programs were popular, he basked in the praise for what he was doing, and 
he remained confi dent that the Goldwater conservatives were certainly not going to 
desert the Republican Party for the Democrats.

However, Nixon was an unusually ruthless “win-at-all-costs” politician more than 
he was either a liberal or conservative. If a policy like increasing Social Security benefi 
ts or launching the EPA brought him votes, he was all for it. If fanning the fl ames 
of divisiveness brought more votes, Nixon fostered division. He encouraged Vice 
President’s Agnew’s attacks on protestors and experts. Nixon himself condemned 
protestors as “the vicious and lawless elements in our society.” 
In planning his reelection campaign, Nixon and his campaign manager, former 
Attorney General John Mitchell, developed a “southern strategy” to win over Wallace 
voters. Th e administration slowed enforcement of federal guidelines for school desegregation 
and courted segregationist politicians. When offi cials in the Justice Department 
sought to enforce desegregation rules, Nixon wrote to John Ehrlichman, his closest 
aide, “Do what the law requires and not one bit more .” He approved a plan that would 
involve the CIA and FBI in illegal bugging and wiretapping. He maintained a “Freeze 
List” of those who must never be invited to the White House and a larger “Enemies 
List,” including reporters, politicians, and others, who should be watched regularly. 
International Issues—Vietnam, China, and Beyond 
Before he left offi ce, LBJ had reduced the bombing of North Vietnam and begun the Paris 
Peace Talks . Even so, the war itself dragged on. In his presidential campaign, Nixon had 
promised a “secret plan” to end the war, but the end would still be a long time coming. 
Nixon and his National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger had a habit of bypassing the 
State Department and sometimes even their own staff . In Vietnam and other foreign policy 
arenas, the Nixon-Kissinger policies were the closely guarded work of these two men. 
THE CONTINUING SAGA OF VIETNAM In the fi rst months of the Nixon-Kissinger 
tenure, the Paris Peace Talks went nowhere. Nixon expanded the bombing of North 
Vietnam and started bombing supply routes and North Vietnamese enclaves in neutral 
Cambodia. In the next 4 years, from early 1969 until the bombing ended in December 
1972, more U.S. bombs were dropped on Cambodia than were dropped by the United 
States during World War II. Th e expanded bombing did nothing to break the will of 
the North Vietnamese leadership, though damage and civilian casualties were high. 
Th e bombing of Cambodia took a higher toll. 
A year aft er the bombing began, Cambodia’s prime minister, Lon Nol, overthrew 
the chief of state, Prince Sihanouk. From his exile in China, Sihanouk then urged 
Cambodians to join the anti-American communist resistance, the Khmer Rouge. Th e 
result was a devastating civil war in heretofore relatively peaceful Cambodia. When 
the Khmer Rouge—a very diff erent communist insurgency from that in Vietnam— 
defeated the Lon Nol government, they launched a decade of horror in which they 
tried to turn the clock back to “Year Zero” and make Cambodia a preindustrial state. 
In the process, they killed teachers or anyone showing signs of American, Vietnamese, 
or western education or influence. Perhaps a quarter of all Cambodians died, and 
many who survived had then to live through years of 14-hour work days and constant 
hunger. Ironically the horror of the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia ended only when 
Vietnam invaded the country in 1978. 
While Nixon and Kissinger expanded the bombing, they sought to withdraw 
American ground troops from Vietnam. It was, aft er all, sending young Americans to 
Vietnam that was fueling most of the resistance to the war. In May 1969, the administration 
announced plans to change the draft regulations so a new lottery system would 
give young men a better sense of the odds of their being called while reducing the 
overall size of the call-up “pool.” Eventually, the Nixon administration moved from a 
draft to an all-volunteer army to reduce public resistance to Vietnam and future wars. 
The administration’s new policy was called Vietnamization . Money and arms 
would be sent to the South Vietnamese government so more and better trained 
Vietnamese troops might replace American troops. In 1969, the South Vietnamese 
army expanded from 850,000 to 1,000,000 troops while the fi rst 25,000 U.S. troops

were withdrawn. In the years that followed, fewer and fewer American troops were 
stationed in Vietnam. However, the people of South Vietnam had never embraced the 
war with the enthusiasm that either the South Vietnamese or American governments 
wanted, so it was diffi cult for the South Vietnamese government to rely on their loyalty. 
Maintaining the morale of the U.S. troops who remained in Vietnam was very diffi - 
cult. Th e war seemed to have no purpose. Th ose on leave sometimes refused to return. 
Desertions spiked as soldiers sought asylum in Canada or Sweden. In Vietnam, there 
were near-mutinies as soldiers refused to fi ght for strategic positions that seemed to 
have no value; “fragging” of offi cers—sometimes lethal attacks on offi cers by enlisted 
men—increased dramatically with over 1,000 reported between 1969 and 1972. Racial 
tensions among the troops escalated. Drug use increased. By one estimate 40,000 of 
the 250,000 troops remaining in Vietnam in 1971 were using heroin. Protests against 
the war mounted within the army itself. 
Aft er 1968, protests against the war were larger and angrier than ever. In the fall 
of 1969, 600,000 to 750,000 people gathered on the Washington Mall to protest the 
war. When Nixon confi rmed that U.S. troops had invaded Cambodia in April 1970, 
protests took place on 350 college campuses around the country. A quarter of all the 
nation’s college students may have been involved. On May 4, Ohio National Guard 
troops opened fi re at protesters at Kent State University, killing four. Two days later, 
local police killed two protesting students at historically black Jackson State College 
in Mississippi. In April 1971, 1,000 veterans of the war camped out in Washington 
to protest the war while they read the names of dead buddies and fl ung medals on 
the Capitol steps. One of the veterans, 27-year-old John Kerry—a future senator and 
presidential candidate—testifi ed before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He 
asked, “How do you ask a man to be the last man to die for a mistake?” 
President Nixon insisted that the protests made no impact on him. When students 
from a number of universities gathered in May 1970 to remember the four who died 
at Kent State, construction workers jumped into the crowd, hitting the students with

The killing of four protesting students at Ohio’s Kent State University, followed by the killing of two more 
at Jackson State in Mississippi, change the nation’s mood. The country was fi ghting a distant war while 
disagreements about that war were leading Americans to shoot and kill other Americans at home.

their hard hats. A few days later, offi cials of the construction unions presented Nixon 
with an honorary hard hat which he accepted as a “symbol, along with our great fl ag, 
for freedom and patriotism to our beloved country.” A Newsweek poll reported that 58 
percent of Americans blamed the Kent State students for the violence, only 11 percent 
the National Guard. Th e same poll showed that 50 percent of Americans approved the 
invasion of Cambodia while 39 percent opposed it. Th e anger swirling around the war 
took many forms, not only protest against the war but also anger at the protesters and 
anger at two presidential administrations as much for the failure to expand the war as 
for making war in the fi rst place. 
Th en, as the 1972 presidential election approached, the United States and North 
Vietnam, meeting at the so-far unproductive Paris Peace talks, agreed to a compromise. 
Henry Kissinger, in private meetings with the North Vietnamese negotiators, 
agreed that North Vietnamese troops in South Vietnam could remain there pending 
a fi nal resolution. Le Duc Th o, the North Vietnamese negotiator at the talks, agreed 
that the South Vietnamese Th ieu government could stay in place pending the resolution 
and that American prisoners of war—mostly bomber pilots some of whom had 
been held for years—would be returned. On October 31, 1972, Kissinger announced 
“Peace is at hand.” It turned out to be a premature announcement. South Vietnamese 
President Th ieu, who had not been informed of the changing U.S. position, objected 
to the continued presence of northern troops, and aft er Nixon had won a second term 
on November 7, he backed Th ieu. Th e war continued. 
In December 1972, aft er his reelection, Nixon expanded the bombing of the North. 
More bombs were dropped in the 12-day “Christmas bombing” than in the previous 
3 years. In January 1973, peace talks led back to the same agreement as had been considered 
in October, in spite of Th ieu’s continuing skepticism. On January 27, 1973, a 
cease-fi re took eff ect; U.S. combat troops soon left the country. American prisoners of 
war were returned and went home. Th e direct U.S. involvement in Vietnam was over. 
Th e United States continued to provide aid for the Th ieu government, kept advisers 
in South Vietnam, and bombed supply routes in Cambodia. But without U.S. fi ghting 
forces, the South Vietnamese government lost ground and would lose more ground in 
the years ahead. 
CHINA While the war to stop a communist victory in Vietnam continued, Nixon, 
in perhaps the most surprising move of his administration, began to normalize U.S. 
relations with communist China. Ever since the communist victory in 1949, the 
People’s Republic of China and the United States had remained deeply hostile to each 
other. Th e United States continued to recognize the Chinese government-in-exile on 
the island of Taiwan as the offi cial government of China, in spite of the fact that the 
communist government based in Beijing ruled the land. Th en in July 1971, National 
Security Adviser Kissinger made a secret trip to China and laid the groundwork for a 
highly publicized trip by President Nixon to China in February 1972. Nixon’s every 
move was televised, including his handshake with Chairman Mao Zedong, his toasts 
with Premier Zhou En-lai, and his tour of the Great Wall. 
Th e trip had a number of substantive benefi ts for all concerned. From Nixon’s perspective 
he got a promise that China would not intervene in Vietnam. China got a 
promise of a smaller U.S. military presence in Taiwan. Both countries established new 
diplomatic channels and expanded trade and travel opportunities. For China, the trip 
also meant an end to decades of isolation, and for Nixon, it was a public relations 
boost at the beginning of an election year. Long aft er the trip, Nixon said, “Th is was 
the week that changed the world…a bridge across 16,000 miles and 22 years of hostilities.” 
In a tense world, it certainly began a new era of cooperation and coexistence. 
EXPANDED FOREIGN DEALINGS While Nixon’s trip to China received the most 
publicity, U.S. dealings with the Soviet Union may have been more substantive. In 
September 1970, Nixon and Soviet Premier Leonid Brezhnev came to an agreement 
about Cuba. While the Soviet Union continued to provide Cuba with aid and the

United States continued its embargo on trade with the island, relations thawed considerably 
when the Soviets agreed to suspend building a submarine base there and the 
United States promised there would not be another invasion of the island. 
A year later, the United States and Soviet leaders reduced tensions in Berlin. In 
May 1972, Nixon traveled to Moscow for a meeting with Brezhnev in which they 
agreed to a Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (known as SALT I) and an Anti- 
Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM) that began the process of reducing the world’s supply 
of nuclear weapons. 
Other elements in the Nixon-Kissinger foreign policy were less successful. Th e Six- 
Day War in the Middle East had taken place in June 1967, a year and a half before 
Nixon’s election, but the new administration had to deal with the outcome. In a 
deceptive move, using American-supplied weapons but keeping the Americans in the 
dark about their intentions, Israel attacked Egypt and Syria. Th e Egyptian army was 
devastated, and Israeli troops came close to overthrowing the government of Syria 
until stopped by the United States at the insistence of the Soviets, who used the hot 
line between Washington and Moscow for the fi rst time. Israel seized 42,000 square 
miles and tripled its size. 
Nixon supported friendly Arab governments, especially the then “twin pillars” of 
Saudi Arabia and Iran. Nixon was delighted that with their oil money—much of it 
U.S.-supplied through massive oil purchases—Saudi Arabia and Iran could also handle 
their own defense and purchase American arms. When a crisis emerged in Jordan 
in the summer of 1970, Israel and the United States jointly defended a friendly government 
there. But real peace in the Middle East remained elusive. 
Nixon and Kissinger sought to project American infl uence in other parts of the 
world with mixed results. Th ey disliked India’s Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and 
believed that India was intent on an alliance with the Soviet Union. Although Gandhi 
could be diffi cult and Indian links to the Soviet Union were real, the long-term result 
was a U.S. policy to strengthen ties to a military dictatorship in Pakistan. Th e alliance 
led the United States to support that government when it tried to put down a rebellion 
in the Bengali region that cost perhaps a million lives. It would be a long time before 
Indian or Bengali people warmed to the United States. 
Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (known 
as SALT I) and an Anti-Ballistic Missile 
Treaty (ABM)

Union to reduce the world’s supply of nuclear

President Richard Nixon, who had made his reputation as a staunch anticommunist, ended years of hostility 
between the United States and communist China with his February 1972 trip.

In Chile, the United States tried hard to keep a Marxist Salvadore Allende from 
winning the 1970 election. When he did win, the CIA kept trying to destabilize the 
Allende government. Th e eff orts worked, and Allende was overthrown and killed in a 
military coup in 1973. Th e U.S.-backed military forces that overthrew the democratically 
elected government launched Chile on a course of years of tyranny and terror. 
Finally in August 1971, almost 3 decades aft er the World War II leaders, meeting 
at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, had made the U.S. dollar the currency against 
which all other would be pegged as a way to stabilize exchange rates (see Chapter 24 ) , 
Nixon announced a “ New Economic Policy ” and ended that practice. In the future, 
the dollar would fl oat freely in relationship to other international currencies. Nixon 
hoped that by cutting the dollar loose from other currencies, the new exchange rates 
would make it easier for people in other countries to buy U.S. goods. He wanted to 
bolster the economy before the 1972 election, and the economy received a valuable 
jolt. Th e long-term result of ending the stability in international exchange rates was 
less certain. 
Quick Review Nixon’s policy has been described as liberalism at home and a tough Cold 
War stance abroad. Explain why you would agree or disagree with this position. 
THE MOVEMENTS OF THE 1960s AND 1970s 
Analyze the many political and cultural movements that followed in the track of the Civil 
Rights Movement. 
The Civil Rights Movement had captivated the country’s attention in the 1950s 
and 1960s, but it was not until the late 1960s and 1970s that many other groups of 
Americans formed their own movements to demand new rights and freedoms. 
Women, Latinos, American Indians, and members of the white counterculture all 
formed their own organizations, made their own demands, and pushed the society to 
acknowledge their concerns between 1968 and 1980. 
The Women’s Movement 
Th rough the 1960s, the place of women in society remained surprisingly unchanged 
and unconsidered. Newspapers still ran separate listings for male and female jobs. 
Only a token number of women were admitted to law, medical, or other professional 
schools. Husbands still had to sign off on a wife’s credit card application. In November 
1964, Stokely Carmichael made his infamous comment, “Th e position of women in 
SNCC is prone.” Women who went to Mississippi to fi ght for civil rights ended up 
doing domestic chores as well as organizing, and women in the antiwar movement 
found it very diffi cult to be seen as credible leaders. Women started to see the reality of 
their circumstances, and they did not like what they saw. 
Women also began running for offi ce in larger numbers than ever before. Only a 
tiny number of women served in state legislatures or Congress before the late 1960s. 
Nevertheless, during the 1960s, momentum grew as more women, and a more diverse 
group of women, started running for and winning elections. More women were elected 
to Congress, including Patsy Mink (D-Hawaii) in 1965, the fi rst Asian woman; and 
Shirley Chisholm (D-New York) the fi rst African-American woman in 1969. In 1971, 
Chisholm, Mink, Bella Abzug, and other women in elective and appointed offi ces created 
the National Women’s Political Caucus (NWPC), a bipartisan organization to 
encourage women to seek offi ce. In 1972, Chisholm also ran for president and carried 
151 delegates in the Democratic National Convention. In 1975, Ella Grasso was 
elected governor of Connecticut, the fi rst woman to be elected a state governor who 
was not following her husband.

which all other currencies would be based on 
the U.S. dollar.

At the end of the 1960s, some younger women began consciousnessraising 
groups, discussing their experiences as women as well as the 
emotional, political, and economic toll that sexism was taking in their 
lives. Like the students who founded SNCC, these younger women had 
far less patience with working “inside the system” than their elders. 
Some began to separate from larger organizations and political movements 
while others also separated from the men with whom they were 
previously aligned politically or personally. 
A month after the violent demonstrations at the Democratic 
Convention in Chicago in 1968, Robin Morgan began organizing 
women to disrupt the Miss America Pageant in Atlantic City, New 
Jersey. Th e pageant was very popular in the 1950s and 1960s. Women 
representing each state were judged for their beauty and poise. “Miss 
America was perfect for us lefty Women’s liberationists,” Morgan 
insisted, “She touched capitalism, militarism, racism, and sexism, all 
in one fell swoop.” Women who came to Atlantic City had a “Freedom 
Trash Can” in which they threw underwire bras, constricting girdles, 
copies of Playboy magazine, and other symbols of women’s oppression. 
When the New York Post carried the story, the editors wanted to make 
a comparison to draft card burning, and erroneously coined the term 
“bra burning,” though as far as anyone knows, no bras were burned in 
Atlantic City or at any other women’s event. 
A short time later, the Offi ce of Federal Contract Compliance at the 
Department of Labor supported Bernice “Bunny” Sandler when she 
fi led a complaint against the University of Maryland aft er she had been 
turned down for a faculty appointment because, she was told, “Let’s face 
it, Bunny, you come on too strong for a woman.” Sandler decided to challenge the 
decision. Th e case eventually became a nationwide class action suit against university 
discrimination. 
In August 1970, moderate and radical feminists came together to celebrate the 50th 
anniversary of the women’s suff rage amendment. On Women’s Strike for Equality 
Day, fi ft y-thousand 50,000 women marched down New York’s Fift h Avenue, including 
Congresswoman Bella Abzug, National Organization for Women founder Betty 
Friedan, and newer leaders such as Gloria Steinem and Kate Millett. 
Joining Friedan and Pauli Murray, the co-founders of NOW, younger women 
like Kate Millett, Germaine Greer, and Gloria Steinem began their activist careers at 
the end of the 1960s, bringing the issues of women’s struggles and women’s rights 
to the foreground. In 1970, Florence Howe founded the Feminist Press to reissue 
the work of earlier feminist writers and publish the work of new women authors. In 
Massachusetts, 12 women founded the Boston Women’s Health Book Collective and 
published a small booklet, Women and Th eir Bodies, in 1970. An expanded version, 
Our Bodies, Ourselves, became a best seller. A group of African-American feminists 
calling themselves the Combahee River Collective—in honor of a Civil War battle led 
by Harriet Tubman—issued a statement in 1977, saying, “Black, other Th ird World, 
and working women have been involved in the feminist movement from its start,” and 
they wanted to be sure that “elitism within the movement” did not marginalize them. 
Th e poetry of the black lesbian feminist Audre Lorde began to gain wide circulation at 
the same time. 
In 1972, Gloria Steinem, who had become a major voice of women’s liberation, 
sometimes to the irritation of Betty Friedan, launched Ms magazine, which turned 
into a mass market success when it sold 250,000 copies in its fi rst 8 days. Too tame for 
some, and too much of a one-woman show for others, Ms . remained a voice of new 
ideas and important, challenging thinking. It also successfully encouraged a switch 
from “Mrs.” and “Miss” to the marriage-neutral term “Ms.” that matched the equally 
neutral “Mr.” 
In the 1970s, many diff erent groups of women came together to 
protest inequality, raise consciousness, and change the ways men 
and women interacted in American society.

Other women were lobbying state legislatures to make abortions legal. Among 
them was a young attorney, Sarah Weddington, who took on a Texas case that would 
eventually change the abortion laws of the United States. Th e U.S. Supreme Court 
heard the initial arguments of the case of Roe v. Wade in the spring of 1972. Jane 
Roe was a fi ctitious name to protect the plaintiff ’s identity. In January 1973, the court 
announced the 7-2 decision that the right to privacy prevented any state from outlawing 
abortion in the fi rst two trimesters of a woman’s pregnancy. Roe v. Wade would 
lead to battles about abortion and the role of the courts for decades. 
Still other women endeavored to change their working conditions or to open new 
careers to women. In 1973, Boston offi ce workers organized a group they called “9 to 
5,” which became a union. Using new federal laws against workplace discrimination, 
women also entered nontraditional careers in business and the construction trades 
that had been closed to them. Women began to appear as plumbers, bus drivers, and 
senior business executives. 
The leaders of NOW, especially Pauli Murray, were determined to revive the 
struggle for an Equal Rights Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. An Equal Rights 
Amendment (ERA) was fi rst proposed by the Women’s Party in the early 1920s, immediately 
aft er the success of the women’s suff rage amendment. By the 1970s it seemed 
like the next logical step. Newly elected Representative Shirley Chisholm gave a passionate 
speech, “Equal Rights for Women” to the House in 1969. NOW began serious 
lobbying of the Senate in 1970. Th e ERA passed by a vote of 354 to 24 in the House 
and 84 to 8 in the Senate. President Nixon endorsed the amendment that said simply, 
“Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or 
by any state on account of sex.” As we will see, however, as it moved through state legislatures 
for ratifi cation, the ERA fell victim to a much changed political atmosphere. 
The United Farm Workers, 1965–1970 
César Chávez began organizing in the grape-growing town of Delano, California, in 
1961. He was soon joined by Dolores Huerta. Th e Farm Workers Association (FWA), 
which later became the United Farm Workers union, drew on both the community 
organizing model developed by Saul Alinsky in Chicago and on the older tradition of 
a mutual benefi ts association within the Catholic Church. Catholic priests and nuns, 
Protestant ministers, and members of the United Auto Workers Union all helped the 
FWA grow. College students, many fresh from campus-based protest and civil rights 
activity, joined the eff ort. It was a powerful coalition, stretching far beyond the small 
towns of California’s little noticed agricultural regions. 
In September 1965, Chavez, Huerta, and Larry Itliong, a leader of the Filipino farm 
workers, planned a coordinated eff ort by Filipino and Latino organizers and called 
a major strike for the fall harvest in Delano. A meeting of 1,200 Mexican American 
workers on September 16, 1965, began with a chant “Viva la Huelga! Viva la Causa!” 
Th e drawn-out Delano strike and subsequent grape boycott had begun and received 
widespread support across the country. It took 5 years, but on July 29, 1970, the 
Delano grape growers signed a contract recognizing the farm workers union as their 
bargaining agent. Chavez declared, “From now on, all grapes will be sweet.” 
The American Indian Movement—From Alcatraz to Wounded Knee 
In November 1969, American Indians began a year-and-a-half siege of the abandoned 
federal prison on Alcatraz Island that gained national attention. Earlier, in 1964, Vine 
Deloria, a 30-old Standing Rock Sioux, won leadership of the National Congress of 
American Indians that had been founded in 1944 to support the development of Indian 
tribal governments. A new direction began for the nation’s largest Indian organization.

W hen Betty Frieda and Pauli Murray launched NOW in 1966, 
they wanted the equivalent of the NAACP for women—a 
national organization to lobby, raise issues in the media, and reach 
a wide audience. In 1969, Shulamith Firestone spoke for more radical 
feminists through the Redstockings Manifesto. While NOW blamed a 
system of oppression, Redstockings blamed men. In response to both, 
Phyllis Schlafly challenged their basic approach and specifically the 
momentum building for an Equal Rights Amendment. 
National Organization for Women, Statement of Purpose, 
1966 
We, men and women who hereby constitute ourselves as the 
National Organization for Women, believe that the time has 
come for a new movement toward true equality for all women in 
America, and toward a fully equal partnership of the sexes, as part 
of the world-wide revolution of human rights now taking place. . . 
WE BELIEVE that the power of American law, and the protection 
guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution to the civil rights of all 
individuals, must be effectively applied and enforced to isolate 
and remove patterns of sex discrimination, to ensure equality of 
opportunity in employment and education, and equality of civil 
and political rights and responsibilities on behalf of women… 
WE REJECT the current assumptions that a man must carry 
the sole burden of supporting himself, his wife, and family, and 
that a woman is automatically entitled to lifelong support by a 
man upon her marriage; or that marriage, home and family are 
primarily a woman’s world and responsibility—hers, to dominate, 
his to support. We believe that a true partnership between 
the sexes demands a different concept of marriage, an equitable 
sharing of the responsibilities of home and children, and the economic 
burdens of their support.

Redstockings Manifesto, July 7, 1969 
I After centuries of individual and preliminary political struggle, 
women are uniting to achieve their final liberation from male 
supremacy. Redstocking is dedicated to building this unity and 
winning our freedom. 
II Women are an oppressed class. Our oppression is total, affecting 
every facet of our lives. We are exploited as sex objects, 
breeders, domestic servants, and cheap labor. We are considered 
inferior beings, whose only purpose is to enhance men’s lives. 
Our humanity is denied. Our prescribed behavior is enforced by 
the threat of physical violence. 
Because we have lived so intimately with our oppressors, in 
isolation from each other, we have been kept from seeing our 
personal suffering as a political condition. This creates the illusion 
that a woman’s relationship with her man is a matter of 
interplay between two unique personalities, and can be worked 
out individually. In reality, every such relationship is a class relationship, 
and the conflicts between individual men and women 
are political conflicts that can only be solved collectively. 
III We identify the agents of our oppression as men. Male supremacy 
is the oldest, most basic form of domination. All other forms 
of exploitation and oppression (racism, capitalism, imperialism, 
etc.) are extensions of male supremacy: men dominate women, 
a few men dominate the rest. All power structures throughout 
history have been male-dominated and male-oriented. Men 
have controlled all political, economic, and cultural institutions 
and backed up this control with physical force. They have 
used their power to keep women in an inferior position. All men 
receive economic, sexual, and psychological benefits from male 
supremacy. All men have oppressed women. 
IV Attempts have been made to shift the burden of responsibility 
from men to institutions or to women themselves. We condemn 
these arguments as evasions. Institutions alone do not oppress; 
they are merely tools of the oppressor. To blame institutions 
implies that men and women are equally victimized, obscures the 
fact that men benefit from the subordination of women, and gives 
men the excuse that they are forced to be oppressors. On the contrary, 
any man is free to renounce his superior position, provided 
that he is willing to be treated like a woman by other men. 
We also reject the idea that women consent to or are to blame for 
their own oppression. Women’s submission is not the result of brainwashing, 
stupidity or mental illness but of continual, daily pressure 
from men. We do not need to change ourselves, but to change men. 
The most slanderous evasion of all is that women can oppress 
men. The basis for this illusion is the isolation of individual relationships 
from their political context and the tendency of men 
to see any legitimate challenge to their privileges as persecution. 
V We regard our personal experience, and our feelings about that 
experience, as the basis for an analysis of our common situation. 
We cannot rely on existing ideologies as they are all products of 
male supremacist culture. We question every generalization and 
accept none that are not confirmed by our experience. 
Our chief task at present is to develop female class consciousness 
through sharing experience and publicly exposing the sexist 
foundation of all our institutions. Consciousness-raising is not 
“therapy,” which implies the existence of individual solutions and 
falsely assumes that the male-female relationship is purely personal, 
but the only method by which we can ensure that our program 
for liberation is based on the concrete realities of our lives. 
The first requirement for raising class consciousness is honesty, 
in private and in public, with ourselves and other women. 
VI We identify with all women. We define our best interest as that 
of the poorest, most brutally exploited woman. 
We repudiate all economic, racial, educational or status privileges 
that divide us from other women. We are determined to recognize 
and eliminate any prejudices we may hold against other women. 
We are committed to achieving internal democracy. We will 
do whatever is necessary to ensure that every woman in our 
movement has an equal chance to participate, assume responsibility, 
and develop her political potential. 
VII We call on all our sisters to unite with us in struggle.

In 1973, traditionalists among the Sioux on the Pine Ridge Reservation in 
South Dakota staged a dramatic takeover of the village of Wounded Knee, site of 
the massacre of 1890. Dennis Banks and Russell Means became the spokespersons 
for AIM and dared the federal government to repeat the attack. Th e standoff 
lasted 71 days as AIM held the town as agents of the U.S. Marshall Service and the 
FBI surrounded them. In May, aft er an FBI agent had been seriously wounded 
and two AIM members killed, both sides agreed to end the siege, and the Sioux 
won a government agreement to reconsider the treaty rights of the Oglala Sioux. 
Another demonstration soon followed when Indians staged a sit in at the 
Bureau of Indian Aff airs offi ces in Washington, DC. In 1975, two FBI agents were 
killed in another standoff at Pine Ridge, and one of the AIM leaders, Leonard 
Peltier, was arrested and sentenced to prison for life, although his involvement in 
the violence and the verdict in his case remain hotly contested almost 40 years later. 
Th e upsurge of Indian activity at Alcatraz, Wounded Knee, the Bureau of Indian 
Aff airs offi ce in Washington, and elsewhere gained more than publicity. In 1970, 
the Nixon administration negotiated the return of the Blue Lake in New Mexico, 
considered sacred by the Taos people, to the Taos Pueblo. In 1971, the Alaska 
Native Claims Settlement Act was passed by Congress, resolving long-standing 
land disputes. Th e 1972 Indian Education Act also provided funds for new schools 
that would be under tribal control. In 1973, the government began again to recognize 
Indian tribes as legitimate agents, starting with the Menominees in Wisconsin.

Phyllis Schlafly, “What’s Wrong with ‘Equal Rights’ for 
Women?”, February 1972 
Of all the classes of people who ever lived, the American woman 
is the most privileged. 
We have the most rights and rewards, and the fewest duties.… 
Women’s lib is a total assault on the role of the American 
woman as wife and mother, and on the family as the basic unit 
of society. Women’s libbers are trying to make wives and mothers 
unhappy with their career, make them feel that they are “secondclass 
citizens” and “abject slaves.” Women’s libbers are promoting 
free sex instead of the “slavery” of marriage. They are promoting 
federal “day-care centers” for babies instead of homes. They are 
promoting abortions instead of families. 
Why should we trade in our special privileges and honored 
status for the alleged advantage of working in an office or assembly 
line? Most women would rather cuddle a baby than a typewriter 
or factory machine. Most women find that it is easier to get 
along with a husband than a foreman or office manager. Offices 
and factories require many more menial and repetitious chores 
than washing dishes and ironing shirts. 
Women’s libbers do not speak for the majority of American 
women. American women do not want to be liberated from husbands 
and children. We do not want to trade our birthright of the 
special privileges of American women—for the mess of pottage 
called the Equal Rights Amendment.…

838 Part VIII Fears, Joys, and Limits, 1945–1980 
Historians have debated why so many different political 
movements—among women, Latinos, American 
Indians, gay men and lesbians, and others—emerged in the 
late 1960s and 1970s. In the 1950s and early 1960s, the Civil 
Rights Movement had been confined almost exclusively to the 
black freedom struggle. A new white student movement also 
emerged in the 1960s. In the next 10 years, it seemed, every 
group of Americans was starting to demand its own rights and 
to challenge social injustice wherever it was found. 
One of the most colorful, if short-lived movement groups was 
the Young Lords Party, a Puerto Rican group that came into existence 
in New York City in 1969. Pablo Guzmán, one of the founders 
of the Young Lords, remembered their origins. His description 
of the diverse forces that led them to organize sheds light on the 
experience of many other groups. 
In Guzmán’s account, the Young Lords began with a street 
protest in the summer of 1969. 
“All we had been trying to do after sweeping up the streets 
on previous Sundays was talk with sanitation about once-aweek 
pickups and nonexistent trash cans, and about how to 
decently treat people asking for help instead of blowing them 
off.” If protests helped win victories for the African-American 
community, they reasoned, why not them. But when the 
protest produced an angry police presence, Guzmán and his 
friends decided to recruit others. “It was the summer of 1969, 
and the first stateside organization of radical young Puerto 
Ricans was announcing itself—we hoped—as a political force.” 
They quickly learned about La Raza Unida (the people united) 
that was emerging among Mexican Americans in the West, 
about the Weather Underground that had broken off from the 
Students for a Democratic Society to embrace more violent tactics, 
and about the Black Panther Party, the militant black organization, 
on which the Young Lords would model themselves. They 
were also influenced by international connections in a world 
where many were challenging American dominance. Guzmán 
had spent a semester studying in Mexico. He said, “I left as Paul 
Guzman, a nervous only-child of a Puerto Rican-Cuban mother 
and a Puerto Rican father…I came back to the states as Pablo 
Guzmán.” 
While other groups influenced young urban Puerto Ricans 
like Guzmán, there were also other roots to the protest movement, 
as Guzmán reflected: 
But it didn’t come from nowhere—my parents and my grandparents, 
after all, had first instilled in me a sense that there 
was far too long a history of injustice in this society. “Only,” as 
my father would say later at my trial, “your mother and I never 
thought you would actually try to do something about it. Not 
on such a scale, anyhow.” 
But with deep roots in their own communities and with the 
inspiration of seeing others, the Young Lords, like the American 
Indian Movement or the gay men of the Stonewall Inn, were not 
going to remain quiet in the face of what they saw as significant 
injustice.

news.

of other movements described in this chapter?

zation, wouldmodel that the Boston School Committee (the local name for the school board) had engaged 
in a deliberate policy of redrawing school district lines to maintain racial segregation, 
and the court ordered an immediate integration of the schools, transferring students 
across the city by bus, for the opening of school in the fall of 1974. Boston exploded. It 
was many years before peace returned to the Boston schools. 
While Boston was split over school integration, New York was split over a proposal 
developed by community leaders, the mayor, and the Ford Foundation for 
local community control of public schools. In certain “experimental districts,” in predominantly 
Puerto Rican East Harlem, and an African-American neighborhood in 
Brooklyn, local school boards were elected and given powers previously held by the

central offi ce. When the Brooklyn board transferred 12 white teachers out of the district 
in May 1968, the overwhelmingly white New York teachers union called a citywide 
strike that lasted for much of the 1968–69 school year, crippled the schools, and 
exacerbated racial tensions in New York. 
In other cities such as Detroit, Cleveland, Baltimore, St. Louis, Milwaukee, and 
Buff alo, whites virtually deserted the city for the suburbs. As a result, more African- 
Americans were elected to mayor’s offi ces. Richard Hatcher had been elected mayor of 
Gary, Indiana, and Carl Stokes mayor of Cleveland, Ohio, in 1967; Tom Bradley was 
elected in Los Angeles, Coleman Young in Detroit, and Maynard Jackson in Atlanta, 
all in 1973; and Walter Washington in Washington, DC, in 1974. 
Blacks and Latinos also began to seek opportunities in higher education in numbers 
never seen before. A growing black middle class could aff ord college in substantial 
numbers for the fi rst time, and Johnson-era affi rmative action programs opened 
doors. But some whites felt that affi rmative action subjected them to “reverse discrimination.” 
Th e arguments about affi rmative action came to a head when Allan Bakke, 
a white applicant, was rejected for admission to the medical school at the University 
of California at Davis in 1973. Bakke sued, claiming that he had been denied because 
the university held 16 percent of the slots for minority students. In the U.S. Supreme 
Court’s Bakke decision in June of 1978, four justices ruled that race-based programs 
were illegal and that the university had discriminated against Bakke while four justices 
ruled that race-based affi rmative action was constitutional. Th e ninth justice, Lewis 
Powell, joined with those ordering Bakke’s admission, but on much more limited 
grounds. Powell said that an individual could not be excluded solely on the basis of 
race, but that race could be a consideration. One law professor remarked, “It was a 
landmark occasion, but the court failed to produce a landmark decision.”

limited, but did not end, affirmative action

In 1974, the U.S. Supreme Court in Lau v. Nichols ruled that school districts must 
make accommodations for students who came to school not speaking English. Th ese 
accommodations could include English-immersion programs or full bilingual programs. 
Th ey could not, as San Francisco had been doing, simply tell a non-English 
speaker like Kenny Lau to make the best of it and learn English on his own. A year 
later, in November 1975, Congress passed and President Ford signed the Education 
for all Handicapped Children Act requiring the “least restrictive” possible accommodation 
for students with special needs. 
Th e 1970s were also a time in which the nature of American racial diversity began 
to change. In 1965, when Lyndon Johnson signed a new immigration law, only fi ve 
percent of immigrants to the United States were from Asia. In the 1970s, that number 
climbed to 50 percent. Small Japanese and Chinese communities grew dramatically 
while immigrants began to arrive from India, Pakistan, and Korea. Especially in 
California, the growing Asian population changed state and local politics. Immigration 
from Latin America also increased signifi cantly, not only from Mexico but also from 
many countries of Central and South American as well as the racially diverse islands 
of the Caribbean. With this growing racial diversity, interracial marriages became 
more common. A child with one Asian parent and one parent from Central America 
was not adequately described with traditional ethnic labels. 
Out of the Closet—Stonewall and Gay/Lesbian Rights 
Th e New York Times for June 29, 1969, carried an article that reported a shift in the city’s 
gay community that would eventually spread to the nation. Of particular note, it said: 
Hundreds of young men went on a rampage in Greenwich Village shortly aft er 
3 a.m. yesterday aft er a force of plainclothes men raided a bar that the police 
said was well known for its homosexual clientele. 
Something shift ed when a group of gay men, whom the police assumed would submit 
quietly to arrest as they had in the past, refused to do so. Many who had long kept 
their identities hidden stood up. Many would never return to a closeted life. In the 
1970s, gay liberation became a political movement. 
While the American Psychological Association (APA) had traditionally defi ned 
homosexuality as “a form of mental illness,” pressure from outside and from within its 
own ranks led to a 1973 change when its board voted to remove homosexuality from 
its list of psychiatric disorders. “We will be removing one of the justifi cations for the 
denial of civil rights to individuals whose only crime is that their sexual orientation is 
to members of the same sex,” an APA leader said. 
In November 1974, Elaine Nobel was elected to the Massachusetts state legislature 
as the fi rst openly lesbian or gay state representative in the United States. Th e following 
January, Minnesota state senator, Allan Spear, announced that he, too, was gay 
and, inspired by Nobel, would no longer keep his sexual orientation a secret. Th en in 
1977, Harvey Milk, a gay man, was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, 
symbolizing the radical change that was taking place. 
A Counterculture and Its Critics—Sex, Drugs, and Rock ‘n’ Roll 
Th e summer aft er Richard Nixon’s inauguration, more than 400,000 young Americans 
gathered on August 15–17, 1969, on a farm in Bethel, New York, for the Woodstock 
Music and Art Fair . Many more would have attended if massive traffi c jams and raininduced 
mud had not made travel to Woodstock exceedingly diffi cult. Th ose who attended 
Woodstock heard Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, and Jeff erson Airplane as well as folk performers, 
including Joan Baez. Many smoked marijuana, swam in the nude, and generally 
enjoyed a weekend free from the constraints of traditional society. If any event stands as 
a symbol of the counterculture of the late 1960s, Woodstock was that event. It was also a 
symbol that stood closer to the end of the counterculture’s life than the beginning.

Several factors helped create the counterculture’s hippies of the 1960s. 
One was the creation of hallucinogenic drugs. Th e creation of a diethylamide 
of lysergic acid (LSD) by Albert Hoff man (no relation to Abbie Hoff man), 
who was seeking a way to treat schizophrenia, set a new generation on a drugassisted 
search for vision quests and heightened ecstasy in body and soul. LSD 
was popularized by Timothy Leary and Ken Kesey as the key to the ultimate 
revelation or a way to “blow your mind.” Music was also essential to the counterculture. 
Rock ‘n’ roll had gone through extraordinary changes in the 1960s. 
Two British rock groups, the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, became huge hits 
in the United States in the early 1960s with music that mocked mainstream 
music, including songs like “A Hard Day’s Night.” Bob Dylan moved from 
folk music to rock. His “Like a Rolling Stone” moved to number one on the 
charts. In “Sergeant Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band” and their fi rst movie, 
Yellow Submarine , the Beatles embraced the psychedelic world. Finally, anger 
at a war that seemed always to be escalating led some, notably Abbie Hoff man 
and Jerry Rubin, to conclude that the best protest was street theater and humor 
that mocked those who they thought were leading the country to ruin. 
If the counterculture had a physical home, it was in San Francisco’s 
Haight-Ashbury district from 1966 to 1969. In Haight-Ashbury, the counterculture 
ruled its own small domain. Street theater could be seen on every corner. 
A group called the Diggers gave out free food. Relationships were casual 
and informal. Drugs were easily available. Th e summer of 1967 was declared 
the “summer of love,” and young people from every corner of the United 
States streamed into “the Haight” to “make love, not war.” But drugs led to too 
many emergency room visits and violence. Rock heroes Janice Joplin and Jimi 
Hendrix both died of drug overdoses in 1970 and Jim Morrison died in 1971, 
each 27 years old. Venereal disease spread rapidly. Th e free food disappeared, 
and the street actors went elsewhere. Utopia, it seemed, could not last long. 
Quick Review How might an historian account for the many political and cultural 
movements that emerged in the 1960s and 1970s? 
THE CULTURE WARS OF THE 1970s 
Analyze the reaction to the liberal and radical politics of the 1960s and 1970s and the 
growth of new militant conservative movements. 
In the 1970s, the United States was a deeply divided nation. Among activist 
women there were major conflicts between feminist and with antifeminist groups. 
Conservative Protestants, Catholics, and Jews found new common ground, oft en in 
opposition to liberals in their own traditions. Th e nation’s deep racial divides shift ed as 
various groups representing specifi c ethnicities—whites, blacks, Latinos, Asians, and 
American Indians—moved in diff erent directions. 
Phyllis Schlafl y and the Defeat of the Equal Rights Amendment 
Perhaps no one symbolized the new political situation, what some have called the culture 
wars of the 1970s, as much as Phyllis Schlafl y. Schlafl y was born Phyllis Stewart in 
a middle-class family in St. Louis, Missouri, in August 1924, 3 years aft er Betty Friedan, 
another child of the Midwest. However, their paths diverged dramatically. Schlafl y, 
deeply infl uenced by her Roman Catholic background and the commitment to individual 
responsibility she was taught as a child, became a Republican Party activist. 
Th roughout the 1940s and 1950s, Schlafl y was a conservative activist within the 
Republican Party. She organized grassroots eff orts for Barry Goldwater and wrote 
A Choice Not an Echo , an attack on liberals within the Republican Party.

new freedoms that were already passing for many.

After the Goldwater defeat, a new opportunity opened 
for her. In December 1971, Schlafl y was invited to a debate in 
Connecticut. She wanted to focus on national defense, but was 
told that the focus would be the Equal Rights Amendment 
that was being debated at that time in the U.S. Senate. Schlafl y 
had no opinion of the amendment, but agreed to read up on it 
before coming to Connecticut. She did, and the result was her 
decision to make opposition to the ERA her prime focus. 
In 1972, as Congress was voting on the ERA, Schlafl y wrote 
“What’s Wrong with ‘Equal Rights’ for Women?” and then 
launched the STOP ERA initiative. Schlafly pulled in women 
whom she knew from anticommunist organizing. By early 1973, 
STOP ERA had chapters in 26 states. Eventually, 35 states ratifi ed 
the ERA, but it fell three short of the required 38 states and was 
not added to the Constitution (see Map 27-1). Schlafl y claimed 
much of the credit for its defeat. New cultural issues, including 
opposition to feminism, to abortion rights, to homosexual rights, 
and to the defense of prayer in school, as well as a particular defi - 
nition of morality and law and order in the larger society, became 
the keys to a new conservative constituency and, for Phyllis 
Schlafly, a new career as an activist. For the Republican Party, 
they would be the keys to victory in several future election cycles. 
The Rise of the Religious Right 
Looking back at the 1972 election, Charles Colson, one of Nixon’s prime advisers said, 
“It was…the fi rst time in modern American political history that social issues became 
dominant.” Th ey would become even more dominant in later campaigns. 
In 1978, Pat Robertson, who had founded the Christian Broadcasting Network 
in 1960, said that if traditionalist Catholics and evangelical Protestants, long distrustful 
of each other, could come together, “We have enough votes to run the 
country.” Th ese were fi ghting words and they made Robertson a central player in 
the religious right in the 1980s. 
By far the most powerful expression of the growing religious right in the 
1970s was a new organization, the Moral Majority , founded by Reverend Jerry 
Falwell, pastor of the Th omas Road Baptist Church in Lynchburg, Virginia, which 
claimed 17,000 members. Falwell was also president of Liberty Baptist College 
(later Liberty University) and host of the television Old Time Gospel Hour, which 
ran on 300 stations for an audience of some 1.5 million people. 
Th e Moral Majority was, Falwell said, “pro-life, pro-family, pro-morality, and 
pro-American.” It was anti-ERA, in favor of prayer in schools, the teaching of 
alternatives to evolution, and like some earlier secular conservative movements, 
intensely anticommunist. Falwell opposed U.S. foreign policy that favored the 
relaxation of tensions with the Soviet Union and called on the nation’s leaders 
to fi ght communism. He said, “Our government has the right to use its armaments 
to bring wrath upon those who would do evil.” Falwell, who had opposed 
civil rights in the 1960s said, “If you would like to know where I am politically, 
I am to the right of wherever you are. I thought Goldwater was too liberal.” Th e

POLITICS, ECONOMICS, AND THE IMPACT OF WATERGATE 
Explain the political impact of Watergate and subsequent developments that set the stage 
for the “Reagan Revolution.” 
U.S. leadership and the U.S. economy faltered in the 1970s. Th e three presidents who 
served during that decade were ultimately viewed as fl awed or weak. Nixon was driven 
from offi ce in a scandal called Watergate. His successor, Gerald Ford, disappointed 
many, particularly for pardoning Nixon, and Ford’s successor, Jimmy Carter, was 
unable to pull a nation out of a crisis with Iran and out of a gas crisis at home. Th e 
country, desperate for strong leadership, put its faith in a movie-star-turned-politician, 
Ronald Reagan, to start a new decade. 
The Economic Context 
Th e 1950s and 1960s had been decades of almost constant economic growth. During 
the 1960s, the nation’s poverty rate dropped from 22.2 percent to 12.6 percent. Th e 
income of many Americans rose dramatically. More Americans had more to spend 
and more fi nancial security than in any previous generation. While the 1970s did not 
see anything like a return to the fi nancial distress of the 1930s, they were not such 
good times. Th e sense of decline was widespread. 
Although the U.S. economy grew in the 1960s, the economies of other countries, 
especially Germany and Japan, grew more quickly. U.S corporations failed to invest in 
research and development as much as companies in competing countries. Americans 
began buying foreign-made goods that were less expensive or of better quality. U.S. 
manufacturers moved production to other countries where wages were lower, costing 
U.S. workers their jobs. In 1971, for the fi rst time since 1900, the United States 
imported more than it exported. 
Throughout the 1970s, unemployment continued to be much higher than in the 
1960s. While high unemployment normally meant low infl ation, infl ation also remained 
high during the decade, and the combination came to be known as “stagfl ation.” To 
keep taxes low and foster public support for the Great Society, while also increasing 
military spending for Vietnam, Lyndon Johnson had allowed government debt to grow 
dramatically. Nixon also did little to reduce government debt, using government programs 
to build popularity while keeping taxes low for the same reason. Th e result was 
continued infl ation in spite of the unemployment. When federal offi cials tried to reduce 
unemployment by providing stimuli to the economy, infl ation got worse. When they cut 
spending, unemployment soared. Th e country began to talk about a “misery index”—the 
combined harm done by unemployment and infl ation. Between March and December 
1974, the Dow Jones Industrial average fell from 892 to 577, a major loss for investors. 
Th e economy was further undermined by a rapid rise in energy costs. In retaliation 
for U.S. support for Israel during the Yom Kippur war in October 1973, Arab members 
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) raised the price 
of oil on the world market. Oil, which had sold for $1.77 a barrel in October 1973, 
rose to $12 a barrel by the spring of 1974. Suddenly gasoline and heating oil were very 
expensive. Presidents Nixon, Ford, and Carter were all bedeviled by public anger over 
long lines at gas stations, something Americans had not experienced since World War 
II. Average Americans saw their disposable income decline as more money had to be 
spent to keep their cars running and their houses warm. 
American automakers were slow to anticipate the impact of the rising prices for 
gasoline and kept making only large gas-guzzling cars. As a result, sales of Japanese 
imports, Toyotas, Hondas, and Datsuns, which had held only a small share of the U.S. 
auto market, soared. Steel mills, tire manufacturers, auto parts makers, and, of course, 
Ford, Chrysler, and General Motors, all cut back and laid off workers. Unemployment 
rose, especially in the Northeast and Midwest, a region that took on the new name of 
the Rustbelt. A 1976 New York Times series described the shift from the old industrial

Northwest and Midwest to the South and Southwest, “All day and through the lonely 
night the moving vans push southward, the 14-wheeled boxcars of the highway, 
changing the demographic face of America.” 
Th e rapid decline of the Rustbelt and the equally rapid growth of the South and 
Southwest meant many things to the United States in the 1970s. Th e South itself had 
certainly changed. It was no longer the rigidly racially segregated economic backwater 
it was in the 1950s. Indeed, the South was more racially integrated than the North. 
Tanya Tucker’s 1974 song, “Th e South Is Gonna Rise Again,” told her audience that 
the South would rise, “but not the way they thought it would back then. I see everybody 
hand-in-hand.” In the new economy, Tucker sang, “I see sons and daughters of 
sharecroppers but they’re not pickin’ cotton anymore.” But they were also not joining 
unions, and wages in the South stayed lower than in the North. Elected representatives 
of the new South tended to oppose what they saw as an intrusive government. 
For some, the rise of the air-conditioned “Sunbelt” stretching from the Old 
Confederacy through the Southwest of Arizona and California, was a chance for a 
fresh start in fast growing cities like Houston, Texas, or Phoenix, Arizona, and the 
suburbs around them. For others, especially those left behind in the north, it was a 
disaster. In 1975–76, New York City suffered a major financial crisis. When the 
decline in city tax revenue and federal aid meant that the city could not pay its bills, it 
was forced to lay off 3,400 police offi cers, 1,000 fi refi ghters, and 4,000 hospital workers. 
Cleveland eventually defaulted on its debts in 1978. Th roughout the North, city 
services declined and crime spiraled. 
Th ere seemed to be relatively little that the federal government could do through 
the 1970s to change the economic situation or address stagfl ation. Tax cuts, proposed 
by every administration, did not have the impact that some hoped and, in the absence 
of corresponding cuts in federal spending, which were highly unpopular, tended to 
fuel further infl ation. Americans found themselves in an unaccustomed era of limits, 
and they regularly took their anger out on political leaders of both parties. 
Watergate and the End of the Nixon Presidency 
When he was reelected in November 1972, Nixon seemed to be at the peak of his 
powers. In fact, he was beginning a long slow decline that would make his second 
term a torture for him, his administration, and ultimately, the country until he fi nally 
resigned in disgrace in August 1974. 
The constitutional crisis known as Watergate began with a simple burglary in 
June 1972. As the election campaign heated up, the special operations group known as 
“the plumbers,” was set up within the ill-named Committee to Re-elect the President 
(CREEP). G. Gordon Liddy, leader of the plumbers recommended to CREEP’s director, 
former Attorney General John Mitchell, and his deputy Jeb Stuart Magruder, that 
they break into the offi ces of Democratic Committee chair Lawrence O’Brien, which 
were housed in the Watergate complex in Washington, D.C., to put a tap on his telephone. 
Mitchell and Magruder approved the plan, but the plumbers were caught. 
Police found an address book on the burglars that included a number for E. Howard 
Hunt, a former plumber now working for CREEP, and both Hunt and Liddy were 
soon arrested as co-conspirators in the break-in. 
Th e White House dismissed the whole thing as a “third-rate burglary.” If Nixon 
had simply admitted the stupidity and fi red Hunt and Liddy, perhaps even Mitchell 
and Magruder, the issue might have ended there. But such a move was not Nixon’s 
style. His orders to his chief aide, Haldeman, were to “play it tough” and, most fatefully 
to order the CIA to stop an FBI investigation of the burglary. In those moves, the 
grounds for the eventual impeachment of the president were laid since the CIA order 
to the FBI was an obstruction of justice. 
While the Democratic candidate George McGovern tried to raise the issue during 
the fall campaign, not much came of it. But when Hunt and Liddy went to trial in front

of federal district judge John J. Sirica, the judge quickly determined that there was more 
to the case than a simple burglary. In addition, two Washington Post reporters, Carl 
Bernstein and Robert Woodward, also began a search for more information, including 
the cultivation of a secret source who they called Deep Th roat. (Only decades later was 
it revealed that Deep Th roat was Mark Felt, Deputy Director of the FBI, who was angry 
that the FBI had been ordered out of the case and angry at Nixon for passing him over 
for the director’s position when the FBI’s long time director J. Edgar Hoover died.) 
In January 1973, just as Nixon began his second term, the Watergate burglars were 
found guilty in federal court. Sirica gave them all maximum sentences, but promised 
to reconsider if they would break their silence. One of the burglars, James McCord, 
started to talk to federal prosecutors. By April, not only McCord but also John Dean, 
Nixon’s White House lawyer, and Deputy Campaign Director Magruder were talking 
to the Grand Jury. Th ey also talked to staff of a Senate Select Committee, chaired by 
Senator Sam Ervin of North Carolina. At that point, several of Nixon’s closest advisers, 
including Haldeman and Ehrlichman resigned. Still, proof of the president’s knowledge 
or involvement of the aff air was lacking. Th en in May, the Ervin Committee started to 
hold televised hearings, and the nation fi rst watched McCord accuse Dean and Mitchell, 
and then watched Dean accuse the White House. Th ey also learned that Nixon had 
secretly taped conversations in the Oval Offi ce to preserve a record for his memoirs. 
By fall, Ervin, Sirica, and Archibald Cox, a Justice Department special prosecutor, 
all demanded the Oval Offi ce tapes. Nixon refused to turn them over, claiming 
“executive privilege,” the right of the president to keep White House deliberations 
confidential. On October 20, the president ordered his Attorney General, Elliot 
Richardson, to fi re Cox as special prosecutor. Richardson refused, and Nixon fi red 
Richardson, then fi red Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus. Finally, the 
third-ranking person at the Justice Department, Robert Bork, fi red Cox. Th e moment 
was known as the “Saturday Night Massacre.” Nixon surrendered only some of the 
tapes, including one from days aft er the break-in that had an “accidental” eighteen 
and one-half minute erasure. Public opinion started turning against the president. 
Th e administration, so thoroughly embroiled in scandal and secrecy, was not able 
to pursue much else in foreign or domestic policy. It was in the middle of the Watergate 
crisis that Arab leaders, angry at Nixon’s eff orts fi rst to reduce the dollar’s value in 
international exchange rates (since oil was paid for in U.S. dollars) and then to support 
Israel, retaliated by increasing the cost of oil by some seven times. When in June 1974 
Nixon tried to defl ect his domestic troubles with another dramatic international trip— 
to Moscow to meet with Soviet leaders—the summit produced no meaningful results. 
In the meantime, things seemed to go from bad to worse for the president. In October 
1973, Vice President Spiro Agnew was convicted of soliciting kickbacks and forced to 
resign. Nixon appointed House Republican leader Gerald Ford as vice president. Ford, 
a popular leader with no particular ties to the White House, was quickly confi rmed. As 
the investigation uncovered more of Nixon’s dealings, the president responded, “I am 
not a crook.” It was a low point in presidential history. But more was to come. 
In March 1974, Haldeman, Ehrlichman, and former Attorney General Mitchell 
were indicted. Federal courts ordered that the White House tapes be turned over to 
the courts and to the House committee, which had begun drawing up charges that 
would lead to the impeachment of the president. Nixon appealed the decision about 
the tapes. On July 24, the Supreme Court ruled that Watergate was a criminal matter 
and executive privilege did not apply. Th e tapes had to be handed over. On July 27, 
Democrats and many Republicans on the House committee began voting to recommend 
the impeachment of the president for obstruction of justice. 
Rather than face the full House vote and the trial in the Senate, both of which he 
now knew he would lose, Nixon went on television on the evening of August 8 and told 
the nation, “I have never been a quitter. To leave offi ce before my term is completed 
is abhorrent to every instinct in my body. But as president, I must put the interest of 
America fi rst.…Th erefore, I shall resign the Presidency eff ective at noon tomorrow.”

As the Nixon family began a sad journey to their home in San Clemente, California, 
Gerald Ford was sworn in as president. Th e nation breathed a sigh of relief that a long 
and distracting ordeal was over. Conservative columnist James J. Kilpatrick wrote, 
“Th e swearing-in of Gerald Ford can’t come one hour too soon.” At noon on April 
9, Chief Justice Warren Burger, just aft er administering the presidential oath to Ford, 
turned to Pennsylvania Senator Hugh Scott and said, “Hugh, it worked. Th ank God 
it worked.” Burger was celebrating the victory of the Constitution. Ford tried hard to 
live up to the trust that people, liberal and conservative, now placed in him. But he did 
not inherit an easy situation. 
Gerald Ford 
Gerald Ford entered the White House with high approval ratings. He also inherited an 
economy that was staggering from infl ation and unemployment as well as an international 
scene that included the last stages of the defeat of South Vietnam. Fortunately for 
him, there was a sense of bipartisan good will in his early days in offi ce. George Reedy, a 
staunch Democrat and former press secretary for Lyndon Johnson, said, “Ford is one of 
the very few men in public life whose absolute honesty I do not question.” Such a reputation 
was a precious, if limited, asset as Ford faced the nation’s problems that were now his. 
Ford came from Grand Rapids, Michigan. He had been an Eagle Scout, a star football 
player at the University of Michigan in the 1930s, and a Navy veteran of World War II. 
Like several other World War II veterans, including Kennedy and Nixon, Ford entered 
politics soon aft er the war, winning a seat in the House of Representatives in 1948. He 
gained a reputation for hard work and honesty and was elected House Minority Leader 
in 1965. Even so, not everyone respected him. Lyndon Johnson said that the House 
Minority Leader had played football once too oft en without a helmet. Before and during 
his presidency, he was oft en portrayed as long-winded and bumbling. 
Th e new president believed that his top priority was to heal a wounded nation. A 
month aft er taking offi ce, he made a controversial proposal that draft evaders be given 
amnesty in return for alternative service as a way to heal the divisions of the Vietnam 
War. Ford gave Richard Nixon a “full, free, and absolute pardon” for any crimes committed 
during his administration. Some hinted that Ford had made a deal with Nixon, 
but the new president insisted during and aft er his term in offi ce that his top priority 
was healing the country, which included moving beyond Watergate. 
Ford was convinced that the best way to counter infl ation and unemployment was to 
get government spending under control and reduce the federal defi cit. Congress, however, 
was very reluctant to accept any of Ford’s proposals to cut federal spending. By January 
1975, as the economy continued to worsen, Ford supported a tax cut. Congress approved 
an even larger cut than Ford had requested, and he reluctantly signed the popular bill in 
March 1975. He then proceeded to infuriate Democrats by vetoing a number of federal 
spending bills. Th roughout most of the rest of his term, Ford and the Congress battled over 
tax and spending issues, both sides wanting tax cuts, but Ford insisting they be off set by 
spending cuts. Each side was determined to blame the other for ongoing economic woes 
and to claim the credit when the economy did improve modestly in late 1975 and early 
1976. However, no one could claim that the economy was healthy during Ford’s term. 
In addition to economic challenges, Ford had also inherited a number of foreign 
policy crises. Th e Cold War was still very real, and when the Soviet Union expelled 
the author Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn in February 1974, public opinion in the United 
States was infl amed, undermining some of Nixon’s détente eff orts to build a new and 
better relationship with the Soviet Union. Ford calmed U.S.-Soviet relations when he 
met with Soviet premier Leonid Brezhnev and signed the Helsinki Accords, promising 
peaceful resolution of outstanding issues and new scientifi c cooperation. Th e Middle 
East, however, remained tense, and India tested its fi rst nuclear weapon in May 1974. 
In addition, Kissinger, whom Ford had retained as secretary of state, supported a military 
coup in Argentina in 1976, as he had in Chile in 1973.

Most frustrating, however, was Vietnam. The last U.S. troops had been out of 
Vietnam for more than a year when Ford took offi ce, but military advisers, CIA, and State 
Department offi cers remained, and the United States continued to provide crucial aid. 
Congress was out of patience with the war. In March 1975, Ford briefl y considered a recommendation 
from Kissinger to resume the bombing of North Vietnam but ultimately 
rejected it. Nevertheless, he was furious when in April Congress refused his request for 
emergency military aid to South Vietnam. In early 1975, the pro-American government 
of Laos fell to communists. In early April, the pro-American Lon Nol government of 
Cambodia fell to the Khmer Rouge. On April 29, 1975, the government of South Vietnam 
surrendered. As North Vietnamese tanks crashed through the gate of the presidential 
palace in Saigon and the last U.S. helicopters took off from the roof of the American 
Embassy, there was little Ford could do but attempt the rescue of some Vietnamese 
orphans, mostly children born as a result of relationships between Vietnamese and U.S. 
service personnel. Th e long American presence was over. South Vietnam disappeared 
and the communist government renamed Saigon as Ho Chi Minh City. 
As the 1976 presidential election approached, Ronald Reagan, the popular twoterm 
governor of California challenged Ford in the Republican primaries. Reagan 
was staunchly anticommunist, attacking Ford and Kissinger for yielding too much to 
the Soviet Union, and he appealed to conservative voters. But Reagan was not able to 
dislodge a sitting president. Ford sought to unify the party by replacing his current 
(appointed) vice president, former New York governor Nelson Rockefeller, on the ticket 
with a more conservative candidate, Kansas Senator Robert Dole, whom Reagan liked. 
R ichard Nixon resigned as president on August 9, 1974, the first 
president in American history to do so. Nixon’s elected vice 
president, Spiro Agnew, had already resigned and, following a new 
constitutional amendment, Nixon had appointed Gerald Ford to the 
office. Thus, when Ford became president in 1974, he was the first 
president in history to be unelected as either president or vice president. 
As he took office, he had a strong sense of the kind of national 
healing that the country needed from him. Moments after being 
sworn in, he spoke to the nation: 
Mr. Chief Justice, my dear friends, my fellow Americans: 
The oath that I have taken is the same oath that was taken 
by George Washington and by every President under the 
Constitution. But I assume the Presidency under extraordinary 
circumstances never before experienced by Americans. This is an 
hour of history that troubles our minds and hurts our hearts.… 
I am acutely aware that you have not elected me as your 
President by your ballots, and so I ask you to confirm me as your 
President with your prayers. And I hope that such prayers will 
also be the first of many.… 
I believe that truth is the glue that holds government 
together, not only our Government but civilization itself. That 
bond, though strained, is unbroken at home and abroad. 
In all my public and private acts as your President, I expect to 
follow my instincts of openness and candor with full confidence 
that honesty is always the best policy in the end. 
My fellow Americans, our long national nightmare is over. 
Our Constitution works; our great Republic is a government of 
laws and not of men. Here the people rule. But there is a higher 
Power, by whatever name we honor Him, who ordains not only 
righteousness but love, not only justice but mercy. 
As we bind up the internal wounds of Watergate, more painful 
and more poisonous than those of foreign wars, let us restore the 
golden rule to our political process, and let brotherly love purge 
our hearts of suspicion and of hate.… 
God helping me, I will not let you down. 
Thank you.

Democrats believed that aft er Watergate, and especially aft er Ford’s pardon of Nixon, 
1976 was to be their year, and they waged a vigorous campaign. At the beginning of the 
primary season, former Georgia governor Jimmy Carter was considered a long-shot in a 
race that involved some of the nation’s best known leaders, including Washington Senator 
Henry Jackson and Representative Morris Udall of Arizona. To the surprise of many, 
Carter won primary aft er primary and went on to a fi rst-ballot nomination. He selected 
the well-known liberal senator from Minnesota, Walter Mondale, as his vice president. 
Carter started the race with a 20-point lead in the polls, but Ford was a better 
campaigner than many expected. In the end, Carter’s focus on the continued high 
infl ation and unemployment, the “misery index,” the lingering national anger about 
Watergate, and Carter’s success in positioning himself as the outsider won the election. 
Th e fi nal vote was very close with Carter winning 50 percent of the popular vote 
to Ford’s 48 percent. Ford took his loss in stride saying, “I want to be remembered 
as…a nice person, who worked at the job, and who left the White House in better 
shape than when I took over.” Most agreed he deserved that tribute. Many also looked 
forward to a more wholesale change of national management in January 1977. 
Jimmy Carter’s Diffi cult Years—Gas Lines, Infl ation, Iran 
By tradition, aft er taking the oath of offi ce at the Capitol, a new U.S. president leads 
the inaugural parade back to the White House. Normally the president rides in a limousine, 
but in 1977, Jimmy Carter chose to walk so he could be closer to the people, 
something that Carter very much wanted to have as a hallmark of his presidency. In 
the long campaign, Carter promised “never to tell a lie or to make a misleading statement.” 
Aft er the lies and cover-up of Watergate and Lyndon Johnson’s “credibility gap,” 
Carter was a refreshing change. 
As the last helicopters left the roof of the U.S. embassy in Saigon in 1975, hundreds of Vietnamese who had 
supported the U.S. eff ort tried to get out. Most were left behind.

Jimmy Carter was born in 1924 in the still rigidly segregated South, in the small 
town of Plains, Georgia. His father was a successful farmer, but Plains was a small 
place, and Carter left it to attend the U.S. Naval academy at Annapolis, Maryland. 
Aft er his navy service, Carter returned to Plains to run the family peanut farm and 
soon entered politics, serving in the Georgia state Senate in the 1960s. In 1970, he was 
elected governor of Georgia. Some civil rights leaders never trusted Carter. But in his 
inaugural address as governor, he said, “Th e time for racial discrimination is over.” 
As governor, Carter courted the King family and created a biracial coalition that he 
thought should be typical of the “New South,” which he sought to represent. 
Jimmy Carter and his wife Rosalynn were deeply religious, active members of their 
Southern Baptist Church in Plains and later in Washington, DC, where Carter taught 
a Sunday School class. Carter’s Christian faith reassured some and worried others, but 
his unapologetic sincerity and his equally clear commitment to the separation of church 
and state—uninterested in imposing his beliefs on others—tended to win him respect. 
Carter’s openness, his down-home style, and his fresh approach heightened his popularity. 
Two months into his administration, the new president had an extraordinary 
75 percent public approval rating. Th e new administration knew from the beginning 
that the economy was the key to any success they would have. In spite of some modest 
improvements, stagfl ation remained a reality, and the rising costs from the energy crisis 
seemed to grow worse by the minute. During his fi rst year in offi ce, Carter proposed a 
large economic stimulus package that included $4 billion for public works programs. 
Although an economic conservative, Carter was willing to risk infl ation to get a sluggish 
economy moving and put more Americans back to work. He also sought to end 
government regulations that he thought got in the way of a more robust economy. He 
signed the Airline Deregulation Act that ended government control of airline prices 
with signifi cant benefi t to consumers. Later in his term, he also supported an expansion 
of the food stamp program to provide food to the hungry and stimulate the economy. 
Carter appointed former Republican cabinet member James Schlesinger as his 
special adviser on energy—later secretary of energy when Congress approved the new 
cabinet department—and told Schlesinger to come up with a comprehensive energy 
plan, and do so in 3 months. Schlesinger did, and Carter appeared on television to 
tell the nation of his new proposals, which included a “gas guzzler tax” on high-mileage 
cars, tax credits for conservation, and a total of 113 separate proposals to reduce 
energy consumption and increase its availability. Newsweek summarized the speech, 
“Some of the time he was Jimmy the evangelist, preaching to a nation living in energy 
sin. Th en he was Jimmy the engineer, rattling off statistics and throwing around terms 
like retrofi tting and cogeneration. And then he was Jimmy the leader, summoning the 
nation to fi ght the ‘moral equivalent of war.’” Unfortunately for Carter, the energy 
plan had been developed in secret, and the Congress was far from enthusiastic about it. 
Carter also tried to deal with both unemployment and infl ation, but by the fall of 
1978, he had become convinced that he had to make infl ation his top priority. Robert 
Strauss, a special counselor in the White House tried with some success to “jawbone” 
business and labor (persuade them through public appeals) to keep wage increases and 
prices down. Later in 1978, Carter appointed Alfred Kahn to institute wage and price 
freezes. Still infl ation increased. As Americans used credit cards to keep up with the 
increases in costs, credit card and other consumer debt grew from $167 billion when 
Carter took offi ce to $315 billion in 1979, further fueling the infl ationary spiral. Only 
late in Carter’s presidency did infl ation decline when Paul Volcker, chair of the Federal 
Reserve Board, dramatically shrank the nation’s money supply, causing a major upsurge 
in unemployment, but that achievement, too, was at great cost to Carter’s popularity. 
Fueling the infl ationary spiral, and causing a crisis of its own, the price of fuel just kept 
going up. In March 1979, the nuclear reactor at Th ree Mile Island in central Pennsylvania 
malfunctioned and the reactor core began to melt down. More than 100,000 Pennsylvania 
residents were required to flee. The disaster led to a national fear and disdain against 
nuclear energy. No new nuclear plants were built in the United States, leading to increased

dependence on oil (see Map 27-2 ). However, oil was a volatile source of energy. Th e United 
States had long since ceased being able to produce all of the oil it needed and imported a 
signifi cant amount from the Middle East (see Map 27-3 ). In the middle of Carter’s energy 
crisis, OPEC increased the price of oil by 60 percent. Carter predicted that the move would 
cost 800,000 people their jobs in the United States. Th e immediate result was further infl ation 
and very real shortages. Gas stations across the country simply ran out of gas. Th e 
public uproar was palpable, and much of the anger focused on the president. 
At the end of June 1979, as Carter returned from foreign policy triumphs—the signing 
of the SALT II arms control agreement with the Soviet Union in Vienna and an 
economic summit in Tokyo, Japan—he received a call from his pollster and confi dant 
Patrick Caddell who insisted that Carter come to Washington immediately, saying, “You 
have no idea how bad it is here.” Th e president cancelled a planned vacation in Hawaii 
and headed to Washington. Aft er a 10-day retreat at Camp David, Carter spoke to the 
nation on July 15, 1979, about what he saw as its “crisis of confi dence.” It was a visionary 
statement, but it did not shorten the gas lines or improve Carter’s standing in the polls. 
Some of Carter’s greatest early successes came in foreign policy, but foreign policy was 
also the arena of his greatest failures. He announced one of his goals in his short inaugural 
address: “We will move this year a step toward our ultimate goal—the elimination of 
all nuclear weapons from this earth.” To accomplish the goal, Carter sought to expand 
détente with the Soviet Union. He also meant to increase respect for human rights at home 
and abroad. Under Carter, there would be none of Henry Kissinger’s Realpolitik stances 
in foreign aff airs that ignored human rights or democratic institutions. Early in his term, 
Carter took a number of steps in all of these directions. He quickly pardoned draft evaders 
from the Vietnam era. He halted production of the B-1 bomber which was planned 
as a more advanced, and expensive, version of the B-52. He ended development of the 
neutron bomb. He also established full diplomatic relations with the People’s Republic of 
China, furthering the new relationship that Nixon had begun. In 1978, Carter won Senate 
ratifi cation of treaties for the eventual turnover of the Panama Canal to the Republic of 
Panama. All of these moves brought harsh critiques, but most Americans supported them.

Carter’s greatest foreign policy triumph was the signing of the Camp David 
Accords between Egypt and Israel in September 1978. Carter was determined to be a 
Middle East peacemaker. He visited both Egypt and Israel and then invited Menachem 
Begin of Israel and Anwar Sadat of Egypt to come to the presidential retreat at Camp 
David for 13 days in September 1978. Carter remembered, “Th e easy, gentle atmosphere 
was very helpful. It kept tensions down.” Aft er some very tough negotiations, 
the leaders achieved a major breakthrough. Th e Camp David Accords included formal 
recognition of the state of Israel by Egypt while Israel agreed to return the Sinai 
Peninsula to Egypt. 
Carter was dogged in his pursuit of détente with the Soviet Union. In June 1979, 
Carter negotiated the SALT II agreement that built on earlier agreements and placed a 
limit on the numbers of missiles and bombers each side would have. It was an important 
development; however, the eff ort at détente was undermined by events halfway 
around the world. In December 1979, the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan to protect 
a beleaguered pro-Soviet government there. Carter saw the vastly expanded Soviet 
presence in Afghanistan as a violation of the decades-old American policy of containing 
Soviet communism. He ended the export of grain to the Soviet Union and ordered 
a U.S. boycott of the 1980 summer Olympic Games scheduled for Moscow. In spite of 
the fact that more than 60 other nations honored the Olympic boycott, it was a deep 
disappointment to athletes who had been preparing for years to compete. Carter’s 
moves had hurt his popularity at home and had undermined his eff orts toward détente.

Carter’s worse foreign policy disaster, however, was with Iran. In January 1979, the 
government of the shah of Iran (who had been installed by a U.S.-backed coup in the 
1950s) was overthrown. Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the exiled leader of the Muslim 
radicals, returned to Iran and created an Islamic Republic with a government that was 
based on religious law and that gave religious leaders like Khomeini ultimate authority. 
When in October the ailing shah was admitted to the United States for medical treatment, 
Khomeini and his followers were furious. On November 4, 1979, a mob stormed 
the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, taking 66 Americans hostage. 
The Iranian hostage crisis became the dominant event of Carter’s last year in 
offi ce. Th e government froze Iranian assets in the United States, expanded the pressure 
on Iran, and tried every way possible to negotiate the release of the American hostages. 
In April 1980, feeling that negotiations were a failure, Carter approved an attack on 
Iran to rescue the hostages. Th e attack was a failure as a sandstorm and hydraulic problems 
disabled some of the helicopters and another crashed into a cargo plane. Eight 
Americans were killed but none got close to the hostages. Secretary of State Cyrus 
Vance resigned in protest. Later that year, aft er Iraq attacked Iran, the Iranian government 
agreed to negotiate but the process was slow. Only on the day Carter left offi ce in 
January 1981, and aft er Reagan had taken the oath of offi ce, were the hostages released. 
The Coming of Ronald Reagan 
Carter’s problems with the economy, energy, and hostages formed the backdrop to the 
1980 election campaign. Within the Democratic Party there was great unease with the 
president. His cautious economic policies and determination to balance the federal budget 
alienated liberals. His go-it-alone style alienated Congress. Massachusetts Senator 
Edward “Ted” Kennedy challenged Carter in the primaries. Public opinion polls showed 
a two-to-one preference for Kennedy, last of the charismatic Kennedy brothers, over 
Carter. But Kennedy never seemed able to articulate the reasons he was challenging 
Iranian hostage crisis 
The i nvasion of the American embassy in 
Iran by revolutionary guards who then took 
66 hostages, holding them from November 
1979 until January 1981. 
Carter’s greatest triumph was presiding over a new peace treaty between Anwar al-Sadat of Egypt and 
Menachem Begin of Israel.

Carter. And for all of his popularity, memories persisted of the time in 
1969 when Kennedy had driven a car off a bridge near Chappaquiddick 
on Martha’s Vineyard and left a young woman, Mary Jo Kopechne, 
to drown. In the end, Carter defeated Kennedy for the nomination. 
Kennedy supported Carter in the general election, but the wounds of a 
tough primary fi ght remained. Carter stayed close to the White House 
and focused on the hostage crisis. Th e president who once prided himself 
on his openness and accessibility now adopted a “Rose Garden 
Strategy,” leaving his offi ce only rarely, even to campaign. 
The Republicans entered the campaign with great confidence. 
Th e contest for the nomination quickly came down to one between 
former California governor and movie actor, Ronald Reagan, and 
former CIA director and U.S. ambassador to China, George H.W. 
Bush. Bush fought a tough campaign, calling Reagan’s economic 
plan “voodoo economics.” But Reagan was hugely popular with conservatives 
who were known as the “Republican base.” He was also an 
eff ective and articulate campaigner and easily won the nomination. 
Reagan named Bush as his running mate. Conservatives, who had felt 
marginalized since Barry Goldwater’s loss in 1964, believed that their day had come. 
Reagan was an eff ective campaigner, impressing many with his sunny optimism. In 
the one presidential debate that was held, Reagan scored points with his poise and his 
response “Th ere you go again” to a Carter critique. Reagan won in a landslide. Th e 
Republicans gained 34 seats in the House, though it still had a Democratic majority, 
but they took over the Senate with a 53 to 47 majority that included the defeat of 
Democratic stalwarts Frank Church of Idaho and George McGovern of South Dakota. 
Th e Democratic Speaker of the House, Tip O’Neill said of the election, “A tidal wave 
hit us.” Bill Moyers, who had served in the Johnson administration, said, “We didn’t 
elect this guy [Reagan] because he knows how many barrels of oil are in Alaska. We 
elected him because we want to feel good.” Th e 1980s and the time of the “Reagan 
Revolution” would be a very diff erent one than the decade that had just ended. 
Quick Review What could Ford and Carter have done to be more effective during their 
terms in offi ce? 
CONCLUSION 
Public discourse in the United States, which had been heated in the 1960s, became 
even more divisive and angry aft er 1969. In the 1970s, new Civil Rights Movements 
emerged as women, gays and lesbians, Latinos, Asians, and American Indians began 
to demand equality and fair treatment. Against this expanding civil rights backdrop, 
a new conservative ideology surfaced, focusing on religion, morality, and culture. 
Compared with the 1950s and 1960s, the 1970s ushered in an economic downturn 
that undercut the security of many Americans. Th e 1970s also gave rise to political 
turmoil as one president was forced to resign in disgrace and two others lost their bids 
for reelection. 
Th e new Civil Rights Movements of the 1970s resulted in advancements for many 
segments of the American population. Women achieved signifi cant legislative and 
judicial victories, which allowed them to improve both their working conditions and 
their social status. Filipino and Mexican American farm workers successfully bargained 
for recognition of a union in California. American Indians staged protests 
at Alcatraz, Wounded Knee, and the offi ces of the Bureau of Indian Aff airs, achieving 
modest gains with respect to civil rights and tribal autonomy. Gay and lesbian 
Americans began to step out of the closet, and the modern gay rights movement was 
born. At the same time, traditional conservatives were bewildered and angered by the 
Blindfolded American hostages are paraded outside the U.S. Embassy 
in Teheran by their militant captors after Iranian students stormed the 
embassy in November, 1979. Sixty Americans and 40 nationals from other 
countries were taken by the students and held captive inside the embassy.

rapidly shift ing culture of the United States, and the so-called culture wars began. Th e 
“moral majority” organized a political response to repudiate both the civil rights agendas 
of the 1960s and 1970s and the Great Society legislation of Lyndon Johnson. 
Th e Republican Party became increasingly conservative in the 1970s, but Richard 
Nixon was an inconsistent conservative at best. During Nixon’s tenure, Title IX 
was added to the Civil Rights Act, the Environmental Protection Agency and the 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration were created, and overall government 
spending to aid the poor rose signifi cantly. On the international front, Nixon authorized 
a relentless bombing campaign against North Vietnam and secretly expanded 
the fi ghting into Cambodia. At the same time, Nixon sought to withdraw all ground 
troops from Vietnam. Despite the war in Vietnam, Nixon normalized relations with 
Communist China and successfully negotiated two treaties with the Soviets designed 
to reduce the supply of nuclear weapons. Ultimately, the Watergate scandal ended 
Nixon’s presidency. When Vice President Gerald Ford took offi ce, he hoped to heal 
a wounded nation, but controversial domestic decisions and multiple foreign policy 
crises seriously damaged the eff ectiveness of his administration. 
In 1976, Jimmy Carter, a little-known governor from Georgia was elected president. 
Carter successfully brokered a peace between Egypt and Israel. Nonetheless, 
ongoing economic problems at home—infl ation, a high unemployment rate, and gas 
shortages—and his failure to secure the release of American hostages in Iran resulted 
in Carter’s stunning reelection defeat to Ronald Reagan in 1980. 
How do you account for the political dissatisfaction with presidents Nixon, Ford, 
and Carter in the midst of so much change in the United States? What changes 
might have helped them? Which hurt the most?

THE NEW POLITICS OF THE LATE 1960s 
Explain Nixon’s policies and politics, domestic and 
international. 
Summary 
The late 1960s saw the emergence of a conservative backlash 
against the social and cultural changes of the 1960s. Th is 
new conservatism was rooted in the development of white 
suburban culture. Conservatism came to be associated with 
the Republican Party and with the political ideology of Barry 
Goldwater. Conservative forces propelled Richard Nixon to the 
White House, but his administration pursued a relatively liberal 
domestic agenda, working with liberal Democrats in Congress 
to pass Title IX, create the Environmental Protection Agency, 
the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and to 
increase funding for the arts. Nonetheless, Nixon employed a 
“Southern strategy” in his 1972 reelection campaign, pursuing 
policies that played to the racial fears of conservative southern 
white voters. Nixon and Kissinger’s approach to the war on 
Vietnam centered on expanded bombing, including bombing 
of neutral Cambodia, and the gradual withdrawal of American 
troops. The shift policy was accompanied by even greater 
domestic confl ict over the war. In 1973 a cease-fi re agreement 
was reached and American troops left Vietnam. As American 
involvement in the war in Vietnam wound down, Nixon pursued 
a new relationship with China and worked to reduce 
tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union. 
Nixon-Kissinger initiatives in the Middle East, South America, 
and in international monetary policy were less successful.

THE MOVEMENTS OF THE 1960s AND 1970s 
Analyze the many political and cultural movements that 
followed in the track of the Ccivil Rrights movement. 
Summary 
Inspired by the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 60s, 
a variety of groups pushed for greater legal and social equality 
in the 1960s and 70s. Th e women’s movement moved forward 
on a number of fronts. More women, and a more diverse 
group of women, started running for and winning elections. At 
the end of the 1960s, some younger women began consciousness-
raising groups, discussing their experiences as women, 
and the emotional, political, economic toll that sexism was 
taking in their lives. A number of women fi led cases to force 
the federal government to protect women from discrimination 
in the workplace. Th e success of NOW and Ms magazine 
demonstrated that feminism had entered the mainstream. In 
1970, the Equal Rights Amendment passed Congress and was 
sent to the states for ratifi cation. Th e 1960s also saw farm workers 
organize to protect their collective interests. Led by Caesar 
Chavez, Dolores Huerta, and others, farm workers made signifi 
cant gains. Th e founding of the American Indian Movement 
signaled a new direction in Indian activism. Dramatic protest 
actions drew attention to American Indians, their concerns, 
and their status. The black Civil Rights Movement entered a 
new phase in the 1970s. School integration eff orts moved north. 
Black politicians were elected to high office in many cities. 
Affi rmative action became a central issue in the national debate 
over race in America. Th e 1969 confrontation between gay men 
and the New York City police at the Stonewall Inn marked the 
beginning of gay liberation movement. Th e counterculture of 
the 1960s celebrated new values associated with a new generation 
and rejected the culture and traditions of the 1950s. By the 
end of the 1960s, the counterculture was in decline, in part as a 
result of the movement’s own excesses.

THE CULTURE WARS OF THE 1970s 
Analyze the reaction to the liberal and radical politics of the 
1960s and 1970s and the growth of new militant conservative 
movements. 
Summary 
In the 1970s, the United States was a deeply divided nation, one 
in which diff erences over fundamental social and cultural values 
were at the heart of political debate. Phyllis Schlafl y led the 
conservative backlash against feminism and the Equal Rights 
Amendment. Schlafl y’s activism was part of a larger conservative 
movement centered on opposition to feminism, opposition 
to abortion rights, opposition to homosexual rights, defense 
of prayer in school, and an insistence on moral and legal absolutism. 
Religious conservatives claimed a central place in the 
conservative movement and in the Republican Party. Th e rise 
of the religious right was epitomized by the success of Jerry 
Falwell’s Moral Majority. Th e emergence of the religious right 
took place against a backdrop of growing religious diversity.

POLITICS, ECONOMICS, AND THE IMPACT OF WATERGATE 
Explain the political impact of Watergate and subsequent 
developments that set the stage for the “Reagan Revolution.” 
Summary 
Th e political turmoil of the 1970s took place against a backdrop 
of a changing global economic situation that adversely aff ected 
the United States. The United States emerged from World 
War II as the most powerful nation on earth, and the 1950s 
and 1960s were decades of almost constant economic growth. 
While the U.S. economy grew in the 1960s, the economies of 
other countries, especially Germany and Japan grew more 
quickly. As the United States lost its competitive edge, unemployment 
and infl ation began to rise. Th e economy was further 
undermined by a rapid rise in energy costs, brought on by the 
policies of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries 
(OPEC). When American automakers failed to adapt to higher 
gasoline prices, their share of the American car market fell. 
Th ere seemed to be relatively little that the federal government 
could do through the 1970s to change the economic situation. 
American economic problems were compounded by political 
turmoil. Th e Watergate break-in and the cover up that followed 
brought down the Nixon presidency. Nixon’s successor, Gerald 
Ford, battled Congress over tax and spending issues, as both 
sides blamed the other for the country’s economic problems. 
Ford’s decision to pardon Nixon remains controversial. Jimmy 
Carter defeated Ford in a close election in 1976, but he could 
not heal the economy or solve the country’s energy problems. 
Carter had a number of foreign policy successes, most notably 
the Camp David Accords, but the Iranian hostage crisis dominated 
his last year in office and contributed to his defeat by 
Ronald Reagan in 1980. Reagan’s election marked a major turning 
point in American politics, as conservatives rose to prominence 
in American government. 
Review Questions 
8. Chronological Reasoning 
Why did the prosperity of the 1950s and 1960s give way to 
the economic downturn of the 1970s? Why did American

diffi cult to solve?

Vice President Richard Nixon and Soviet Premier Nikita 
Khrushchev in Moscow, Soviet Union, 1959 
[ Both men enter kitchen in the American exhibit .] 
Nixon: I want to show you this kitchen. It is like those of our 
houses in California. 
[ Nixon points to dishwasher .] 
Khrushchev: We have such things. 
Nixon: This is our newest model. This is the kind which is built 
in thousands of units for direct installations in the houses. In 
America, we like to make life easier for women. . . . 
Khrushchev: Your capitalistic attitude toward women does not 
occur under Communism. 
Nixon: I think that this attitude towards women is universal. What 
we want to do, is make life more easy for our housewives. . . . 
Nixon: American houses last for more than 20 years, but, even 
so, after twenty years, many Americans want a new house or 
a new kitchen. Their kitchen is obsolete by that time. . . . The 
American system is designed to take advantage of new inventions 
and new techniques. 
Khrushchev: This theory does not hold water. Some things 
never get out of date—houses, for instance, and furniture, furnishings—
perhaps—but not houses. I have read much about 
America and American houses, and I do not think that this is 
exhibit and what you say is strictly accurate.

Questions 8.10–8.13 refer to the following document. 
Harry Truman, speaking to Congress, 1947: 
I am fully aware of the broad implications involved if the United 
States extends assistance to Greece and Turkey, and I shall 
discuss these implications with you at this time. . . . 
To ensure the peaceful development of nations, free from coercion, 
the United States has taken a leading part in establishing the United 
Nations. Th e United Nations is designed to make possible lasting 
freedom and independence for all its members. We shall not realize our 
objectives, however, unless we are willing to help free peoples to maintain 
their free institutions and their national integrity against aggressive 
movements that seek to impose upon them totalitarian regimes. Th is is 
no more than a frank recognition that totalitarian regimes imposed on 
free peoples, by direct or indirect aggression, undermine the f oundations 
of international peace and hence the security of the United States. . . . 
I believe that it must be the policy of the United States to support free 
peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities 
or by outside pressures. I believe that we must assist free peoples to work 
out their own destinies in their own way. I believe that our help should 
be primarily through economic and fi nancial aid which is essential to 
economic stability and orderly political processes. . . . 
— “Transcript of Truman Doctrine,” 1947 
8.10 Which “totalitarian regimes” was Truman referring to? 
a. Germany 
b. U.S.S.R. 
c. Japan 
d. China 
8.11 Shortly aft er this request to Congress, Truman’s 
administration announced the Marshall Plan. What was the 
driving reason behind the execution of the Marshall Plan? 
a. Humanitarian goals to fi ght against poverty, hunger, 
and desperation in Europe 
b. To aid former African colonies in their eff orts for freedom 
c. To prevent mutually assured destruction 
d. To prevent the expansion of Communist infl uence 
8.12 Truman references the United States’ leading part in 
establishing the United Nations. Th is move refl ected a 
shift in U.S. foreign policy that can be best represented by 
which of the following? 
a. U.S. participation in the Spanish-American War 
b. U.S. refusal to help France during its revolution 
c. U.S. involvement with the League of Nations 
d. U.S. response to the “loss” of China 
8.13 Critics of U.S. implementation of the Truman Doctrine 
would argue that the United States did not “support free 
peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed 
minorities or by outside pressures.” Which of the following 
would best support their argument? 
a. U.S. involvement in the Korean War against the North 
Koreans 
b. CIA eff orts to overthrow democratically elected offi cials 
in South America 
c. U.S. support of Diem, a Catholic, in majority-Buddhist 
Vietnam 
d. Truman’s support of Greece and Turkey to keep them 
free of communism 
Questions 8.14–8.16 refer to the following document. 
A knowledgeable and engaged president Kennedy spent as much or 
more time on Cuba as on any other foreign-policy problem. Cuba 
stood at the center of his administration’s greatest failure, the Bay 
of Pigs, and its alleged greatest success, the missile crisis. Why did 
President Kennedy and his chief advisers indulge such an obsession 
with Cuba and direct so many U.S. resources to an unrelenting 
campaign to monitor, harass, and ultimately destroy Havana’s 
radical regime? . . . Th e Kennedys’ famed eagerness for action 
became exaggerated in the case of Cuba. Th ey always wanted to get 
moving on Cuba, and Castro dared them to try. . . . Overarching 
all explanations for the Kennedy’s obsession with Cuba is a major 
phenomenon of the second half of the twentieth century: the steady 
erosion of the authority of imperial powers, which had built systems 
of dependent, client, and colonial governments. Th e strong currents 
of decolonization, anti- imperialism, revolutionary nationalism, 
and social revolution, sometimes in combination, undermined the 
instruments the imperial nations had used to maintain control and 
order. Th e Cuban Revolution exemplifi ed this process of breaking 
up and breaking away. American leaders reacted so hostilely to this 
revolution . . . because Cuba, as symbol and reality, challenged U.S. 
hegemony in Latin America. 
— Thomas Paterson, “Fixation with Cuba,” 1989 
8.14 Which of the following would most directly support 
Paterson’s suggestion about the nature of the Kennedy family? 
a. Kennedy’s decision to “quarantine” Soviet ships and 
meet retaliation with a full response 
b. Kennedy’s open invasion of Cuba with the American 
military 
c. Kennedy’s insistence that the U.S. press north of the 
38th parallel in Korea 
d. Kennedy’s institution of the draft to increase the 
number of soldiers in Vietnam 
8.15 Which of the following best supports Paterson’s 
assumption that American hegemony actively reigned in 
Latin America? 
a. Th e “specter of Haiti” 
b. Th e Cuban Missile Crisis 
c. Th e Spanish-American War 
d. Th e Monroe Doctrine 
8.16 Paterson connects U.S. activity in Cuba with the larger 
problem for the United States of an increase in movements of 
decolonization, anti-imperialism, revolutionary nationalism, 
and/or social revolution. Which of the following pieces of 
evidence would best support his contention? 
a. Kennedy’s use of Cuba as an issue in the 1960 election 
to counter Nixon’s argument that Kennedy could not 
handle foreign policy 
b. Indochina’s desire to be free of French control, and the 
United States’ subsequent involvement 
c. Kennedy’s belief that Castro had double-crossed him; 
Kennedy had initially welcomed the Cuban Revolution 
as an advancement and urged patience toward Castro 
d. Kennedy’s intense concern for and activism on behalf 
of people of color in the United States 

Part VIII AP® Practice Test 859 
Questions 8.17–8.19 refer to the following document. 
We are people of this generation, bred in at least modest comfort, 
housed now in universities, looking uncomfortably to the world 
we inherit. 
When we were kids the United States was the wealthiest and 
strongest country in the world: the only one with the atom bomb, 
the least scarred by modern war, an initiator of the United 
Nations that we thought would distribute Western infl uence 
throughout the world. Freedom and equality for each individual, 
government of, by, and for the people—these American values we 
found good, principles by which we could live as men. Many of 
us began maturing in complacency. 
As we grew, however, our comfort was penetrated by events too 
troubling to dismiss. First, the permeating and victimizing fact of 
human degradation, symbolized by the Southern struggle against 
racial bigotry, compelled most of us from silence to activism. 
Second, the enclosing fact of the Cold War, symbolized by the 
presence of the Bomb, brought awareness that we ourselves, and 
our friends, and millions of abstract “others” we knew more 
directly because of our common peril, might die at any time. We 
might deliberately ignore, or avoid, or fail to feel all other human 
problems, but not these two, for these were too immediate and 
crushing in their impact, too challenging in the demand that 
we as individuals take the responsibility for encounter and 
resolution.

Statement,” 1962 
8.17 Which of the following strategies best refl ects the way 
the men and women who affi liated with the SDS and the 
broader New Left tried to take responsibility for the major 
issues they faced? 
a. Protesting U.S. involvement in Vietnam 
b. Collaborating with President Johnson in the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964 
c. Actively campaigning for Barry Goldwater 
d. Joining the John Birch Society 
8.18 Th e statement refl ects a sense of the 1950s as a time of 
complacency, abundance, and confi dence. Many historians 
would disagree with this depiction of the 1950s. Which 
of the following would best support these historians’ 
contention? 
a. Rise in Americans’ religious adherence 
b. Activity of the Southern Christian Leadership 
Conference (SCLC) 
c. Massive protests against the Korean War 
d. Process of suburbanization that benefi ted mostly young 
white families 
8.19 Which group is most similar to the SDS in its ideological 
view of American society? 
a. Ku Klux Klan 
b. Black Power Movement 
c. Moral Majority 
d. Supporters of Ayn Rand 
Section II: Short Answer Questions 
Question 8.20 is based on the following two quotations. 
Passage 1 
[Th e Verona Project showed that] messages thought to be 
between Soviet diplomats at the Soviet consulate in New York 
and the People’s Commissariat of Foreign Aff airs in Moscow 
turned out to be cables between professional intelligence fi eld 
offi cers and Gen. Pavel Fitin, head of the foreign intelligence 
directorate of the KGB in Moscow. Espionage, not diplomacy, 
was the subject of these cables. . . . 
Th e deciphered Verona messages also showed that a disturbing 
number of high ranking U.S. government offi cials consciously 
maintained a clandestine relationship with Soviet intelligence 
agencies and had passed extraordinarily sensitive information to the 
Soviet Union that had seriously damaged American interests. . . . 
Information from the Verona decryptions underlay the policies of 
U.S. government offi cials in their approach to the issue of domestic 
communism. Th e investigations and prosecutions of American 
Communists undertaken by the federal government in the late 
1940s and early 1950s were premised on an assumption that the 
CPUSA [Communist Party U.S.A.] had assisted Soviet espionage. 
— John Early Haynes and Harvey Klehr, Verona: Decoding 
Soviet Espionage in America, 1999 
Passage 2 
Critics of these trends [anti-Communist activities] in American 
politics had scant power or spirit. Outside government, foes of 
anti-Communist excesses moved cautiously lest they be redbaited and 
rarely took eff ective countermeasures. Liberals seldom strayed from the 
safety of the anti-Communist consensus. Radicals met the hostility of 
the dominant political forces in Cold War America and fared poorly. 
In government, ant-communism ruled. Senate resistance to McCarthy 
was scattered and weak. In the House, HUAC [House Un-American 
Activities Committee] did as much as it pleased. [President Harry] 
Truman upheld civil liberties with occasional eloquence, but he 
remained on the defensive, and his Justice Department oft en seemed 
locked in near-alliance with the Right in Congress. [Dwight D.] 
Eisenhower, when not appeasing the McCarthyites, appeared at times 
no more able to curb them than had Truman. 
Even at his peak, McCarthy was not the sole anti-Communist paladin, 
though he cultivated that impression. As McCarthyism in its broader 
sense outlived the personal defeat of McCarthy himself, so, in its prime, 
it exceeded his reach. Its strength owed much to the wide acceptance, 
even by McCarthy’s critics, of the era’s anti-Communist premises. 
Along with McCarthy, they made the fi rst half of the 1950s the acme 
of noisy anti-communism and of the ills to which it gave birth.

Perspective, 1990

should it be divided up? Make an argument supporting 
one perspective using specifi c historical evidence.

862 Part IX Certainty, Uncertainty, and New Beginnings, 1980–To The Present 
The voters who gave Ronald Reagan his margin of victory over Jimmy 
Carter in 1980 were a diverse lot. Working-class whites, north and 
south, sometimes called “Reagan Democrats,” were alienated by the 
civil rights and protest movements of the 1960s and 1970s. Many feared crime, 
which they tended to see as a “black issue,” and wanted a champion of “law and 
order.” Th e coalition also included middle-class and upper-middle-class suburbanites 
in revolt over taxes, especially rising property taxes, and government 
regulations that they thought were intrusive. Th e antitax movement led to the 
passage of Proposition 13 in California in 1978, a law sponsored by a private citizen, 
Howard Jarvis, which signifi cantly cut California’s property taxes and ultimately 
the state’s vaunted government services. Other states copied Proposition 
13, reducing taxes and public services. A third group of Reagan supporters 
were social conservatives—Catholics and Protestants associated with the religious 
right—for whom the key issues were their opposition to abortion, sexual 
and reproductive freedoms, gay rights, and the teaching of evolution as well as 
their desire for prayer in the public schools. In seeking to limit abortion or gay 
rights, the social conservatives wanted a more activist government, even if they 
otherwise favored a smaller government and lower taxes. 
Th ese diverse groups also shared a staunch hostility to communism and 
believed that presidents from Franklin Roosevelt to Richard Nixon had been 
too soft . Th ey were united in their anger at those they considered elitist—celebrities 
in Hollywood, the media, universities, and the federal government. In 
Ronald Reagan, the former actor and two-term governor of California, they

found a hero who, they believed, would not disappoint them as had Richard Nixon. Th is 
chapter is a look at the Reagan Revolution, the wide-ranging changes in the federal government, 
in U.S. international relations, and in American culture that took place while 
Ronald Reagan was president, some with his support and some in spite of his best eff orts. 
A RAPIDLY CHANGING U.S. GOVERNMENT 
Explain Reagan’s impact on the United States and the world. 
Many federal government programs that dated from the New Deal changed drastically 
during what came to be known as the Reagan Revolution . By the end of the 8 years 
that Ronald Reagan was president, taxes took less of people’s incomes, the federal debt 
ballooned, and a 50-year period in which labor unions could rely on a friendly government 
came to an end. Th e Cold War, which had been the dominant element in U.S. 
foreign policy since the end of World War II, also ended. Both the Republican and 
Democratic parties emerged from the Reagan Revolution more conservative than they 
had been. Supporters and detractors all agreed that the presidency of Ronald Reagan 
was a signifi cant turning point in the United States. 
Ronald Reagan and the Reagan Coalition 
When Ronald Reagan became president, he was only 1 month short of his 70 birthday, 
the oldest man ever elected to the offi ce. Reagan was born in the small town of 
Tampico, Illinois, in 1911. His father was a shoe salesman and an alcoholic who was 
unsuccessful in his search for better jobs until he was hired by the New Deal’s WPA. 
His mother, who worked as a seamstress, was a religious woman who made sure that 
the young Ronald and his brother were brought up in church. He said of his childhood, 
“We didn’t live on the wrong side of the tracks, but we lived so close we could 
hear the whistle real loud.” Handsome and popular, Reagan was elected high school 
class president and then student body president at Eureka College in Illinois. 
Soon aft er college, and aft er a brief stint as a sports announcer in Iowa, Reagan left 
the Midwest for Hollywood where he appeared in 53 fi lms between 1937 and 1953. It was 
steady work and it paid well. Reagan later said that he generally made two pictures per 
year, earning $300,000 to $400,000 per fi lm, and would have worked harder to make more 
pictures if not for the high tax bite. Th e fi lm work took Reagan a long way from the marginal 
economic status of his childhood. He married and later divorced Jane Wyman, whose 
Hollywood career was more successful than his; he would be the fi rst divorced person 
elected president. He was popular in Hollywood and was elected president of the Screen 
Actors Guild from 1947 to 1952, a position he used to identify suspected Communists in 
the fi lm industry. When he became U.S. president, he was the fi rst former union president 
to do so. During his Hollywood years, Reagan remained a Democrat, voting for Harry 
Truman in 1948 and against Richard Nixon for the Senate in 1950. 
In 1952 he married Nancy Davis and left a declining Hollywood career to become a 
spokesperson for the General Electric Company, serving as the TV host of the General 
Electric Th eater program from 1954 to 1962. Working for GE, he also gave pep talks to 
workers at GE plants, touted GE products, and spoke about the corporation’s views on taxes 
and government regulation to business groups. In his GE career, as in Hollywood, Reagan 
mastered the art of connecting with audiences, especially, maintaining a relaxed and genial 
presence in the face of lights, crowds, and distractions as well as delivering content from a 
script. While at GE he also changed his party registration from Democrat to Republican. 
By the time Reagan left GE in 1962, he was as well known for his political views 
as his acting. He supported Barry Goldwater in 1964. In a standard stump speech that 
came to be known simply as “the speech,” Reagan said that the choice facing Americans 
was “whether we believe in our capacity for self-government or whether we abandon 
the American Revolution and confess that a little intellectual elite in a far-distant

capital can plan our lives for us better than we can plan them ourselves.” Th e speech 
did not elect Goldwater, but it did bring Reagan to the attention of a crucial audience— 
rich Republican conservatives who agreed to back him if he would run for governor 
of California in 1966. Th e incumbent governor, Democrat Edmund G. “Pat” Brown, a 
tough campaigner who had defeated Richard Nixon in 1962, was seeking a third term in 
1966. Reagan defeated him in the fall election and won reelection as governor in 1970. 
Reagan talked a more conservative line all through his presidency than he practiced 
while he was governor of California. While he was tough on student protests, 
raised tuition at California’s public colleges and universities, and ousted Clark Kerr 
as the president of the University of California, he was willing to compromise with a 
Democratic legislature on other matters. He raised taxes to cover a budget shortfall 
as well as signed bills supporting liberalized abortion rights and bilingual education. 
Some of his conservative supporters were nervous about his positions but valued his 
skill as a campaigner. As a conservative governor of the nation’s largest state, Reagan 
quickly became a presidential contender. He almost defeated Gerald Ford for the 1976 
Republican nomination and easily defeated George H.W. Bush to win the 1980 nomination 
and then the presidential election against Jimmy Carter. As president, he did 
not disappoint most of his supporters. 
Reaganomics—Supply-Side Tax Cuts, Military Growth, and Electoral 
Politics 
Reagan came to offi ce with three priorities: increasing military spending to ensure that 
the United States was signifi cantly stronger than the Soviet Union, cutting domestic 
spending and government-sponsored social programs, and cutting the federal income 
tax. He was willing to compromise on almost everything else. 
The antitax crusade had helped elect Reagan, and he surrounded himself with 
advisors who developed new economic theories to defend a tax cut even as he sought 
increased military spending. Reagan justifi ed the tax cut with an economic theory 
known as supply-side economics . As defined by Republican congressman Jack 
Kemp and Democratic senator Lloyd Bentsen, supply-side referred to stimulating the 
economy, not by means of federal spending—the traditional approach since the New 
Deal—but, rather, by means of supporting the supply side—cutting taxes to foster private 
investment that might then lead to the creation of new jobs. 
Tax cut proponents also cited what is called the “Laff er curve.” Developed in the 
1970s by Jude Wanniski, a correspondent for the Wall Street Journal , and economist 
Arthur Laff er, the curve meant to show that higher taxes reduced government income 
by reducing the incentive to work and earn taxable wages. At the extreme ends, the 
curve made complete sense. Zero tax would not impact work and earning in any way, 
and a 100 percent tax would certainly stifle most work. But the point in between, 
where taxes really cut into the will to work and where decreased tax rates might actually 
increase government income, was hard to pinpoint. 
When Reagan fi rst called for a 30 percent tax cut and used Laff er and the supplyside 
arguments to justify his position, his main rival for the 1980 Republican nomination, 
George Bush, called it “voodoo economics,” and Jimmy Carter called Reagan’s 
tax plans, “rebates for the rich, deprivation for the poor, and fi erce infl ation for all of 
us.” But aft er he became president, Reagan dismissed criticism, saying of the economists 
who challenged his ideas, “Th ey’re the sort of people who see something works 
in practice and wonder if it works in theory.” In spite of a lack of evidence in either 
practice or theory, the president made a tax cut his fi rst priority, and in August, 48 
congressional Democrats—their Democratic colleagues called them “boll weevils”— 
joined the Republican minority to pass a cut in federal income taxes that reduced the 
top rate on individual income from 70 to 50 percent. Th e president won the fi rst of his 
three goals for his Reagan Revolution—the implementation of “Reaganomics,” as his 
economic policy came to be called—in less than 100 days in offi ce. 
supply-side economics 
An economic theory that to stimulate the 
economy the best intervention is a tax cut 
that would stimulate the “supply side.” 

Chapter 28 The Reagan Revolution 865 
28.1 
28.2 
28.3 
In addition to the tax cut, Congress passed a modifi ed version of Reagan’s budget. 
He did not get all the cuts he wanted, but the new federal budget reduced domestic 
spending signifi cantly. Reagan also used his administrative authority to cut a number 
of additional federal programs, including food stamps and other programs for the 
poor as well as Social Security benefits for people with disabilities. Some 500,000 
people were removed from the Social Security disability list. Another 300,000 who 
had been employed through the Carter administration’s Comprehensive Employment 
and Training Act (CETA) lost their government-sponsored jobs. Th e cuts were not 
the wholesale abolition of welfare that Reagan advocated, but they represented a substantial 
cut in the federal safety net that had been growing since the 1930s. At the same 
time, some programs such as Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and 
federal tax credits for the poor actually expanded during the Reagan years. 
While campaigning for the presidency, Reagan also promised to expand the military 
so the United States would, without question, be the most powerful nation on earth. As 
a candidate, he said, “You spend what you need.” As president, he got congressional 
approval to develop a new B-2 bomber as well as cruise and MX missiles and to expand 
the Navy. During his fi rst term in offi ce, from 1981 to 1985, the total defense spending 
of the United States rose by 34 percent, from $171 billion to $229 billion. 
Within months of the new administration coming to office, Americans understood 
that the change in Washington was signifi cant, indeed, that some federal policies 
that had been in place since the 1930s were no longer going to continue. In addition 
to the tax cuts and expanded military spending, the new administration showed its 
attitude when the members of the Professional Air Traffi c Controllers’ Organization 
(PATCO)—the people who guide airplanes on take-off and landing—went on strike. 
Th e president told the members of the union, who were federal employees, that they 
had 48 hours to go back to work or they would be fi red. When almost two-thirds of 
PATCOs members stayed out on strike, Reagan fi red all 11,000 of them. Th ey permanently 
lost their jobs, and the union was destroyed. People worried about the safety of 
air travel with so many veteran controllers gone, but the signal that this administration 
was going to have a diff erent view of unions was clear. Organized labor, used to 
having a friend in the White House, was demoralized. Other strikes were also defeated,

The Reagan cuts in domestic programs, including health insurance benefi ts for the elderly through

themselves.

including an especially bitter one by the meatpackers at the Hormel plant in Minnesota 
in 1985–86. Union membership dropped from one-fourth of the U.S. workforce to 
one-sixth during Reagan’s two terms. Organized labor, long a major force in American 
society, was on a long slow decline, something that delighted the president and his 
conservative backers. 
In the short term, the Reagan initiatives did not improve the nation’s economy. 
Th e president strongly supported Federal Reserve Chair Paul Volcker, whom Carter 
had appointed. Both presidents told Volcker to curb infl ation no matter what the cost. 
Volcker did, with tough policies that sent unemployment above 10 percent in 1982, 
the highest since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Many people lost jobs, and new 
jobs were oft en in low-paying service sectors of the economy. Homelessness doubled 
while Reagan was in offi ce from an estimated 200,000 to 400,000. Th e recession of the 
early Reagan years hurt the president’s popularity, and the Republicans lost seats in 
Congress in the 1982 elections. Reagan, with his optimism and self-confi dence, asked 
the nation to “Stay the Course.” By 1983, the national economy started to improve 
and continued to do so through the last 5 years of Reagan’s tenure. Economists argued 
whether the improvement was due to the tax cuts or expanded military spending, but 
in either case, a strong economy made Reagan more popular. 
One result of the Reagan economic agenda was rapid growth in the federal defi cit. 
Th e tax cut did not bring in as much new revenue as estimated, while the expansion of 
military spending more than off set cuts in domestic programs. Th e total federal defi cit 
nearly tripled during the Reagan years from $914 billion to $2.7 trillion. More than one 
supporter saw the defi cit as Reagan’s greatest failure. Th e United States, which had been 
a major creditor nation since World War I, became the world’s largest debtor nation. 
The government kept borrowing money to cover the federal deficit while individuals 
borrowed money—oft en by running up credit card debt. If some complained that 
Americans were maintaining a living standard beyond their means, they quickly noted 
that the worst off ender was the U.S. government. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, once an 
advisor to Richard Nixon and who was a Democratic Senator from New York throughout 
the Reagan years, warned that the huge defi cits virtually guaranteed that new federal 
initiatives to improve the lives of average or poor citizens were now off the table. 
Reagan faced the prospect of reelection in 1984 with some signifi cant strengths 
and some formidable weaknesses. To challenge him, the Democrats had, after an 
intense primary battle with Colorado senator Gary Hart, selected former vice president 
Walter Mondale as the Democratic candidate for president. In an historic move, 
Mondale asked New York Representative, Geraldine Ferraro, to be his running mate, 
the first time a woman was on the ticket of a major political party. At 73, Reagan 
seemed old, especially when in one debate with Mondale he seemed to lose track of a 
story he was telling. Reagan dismissed the issue saying, “I will not make age an issue in 
this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent’s youth 
and inexperience.” 
Reagan could not so easily dismiss other issues, however. Labor unions almost unanimously 
supported Mondale, although because of Reagan’s policies they had far less clout. 
Most African-Americans supported Mondale, continuing a move by black voters to the 
Democratic Party that was speeded by Reagan’s inattention to their needs. Moreover, 
Reagan’s silence on the rising epidemic of AIDS, a new and deadly disease, created some 
of his toughest enemies. Even social and religious conservatives who had flocked to 
Reagan in 1980 were disappointed. He had done little more than talk about many of their 
issues such as school prayer during his fi rst term. As president, he never gave a speech to 
an antiabortion audience. However, conservatives did not have another candidate. 
Other developments helped Reagan in 1984. By 1983, the economy started to turn 
around. More Americans had jobs and people were buying more goods, often on 
credit, including personal computers, video cassette recorders (VCRs), and telephone 
answering machines that had not been available in the 1970s.

Reagan also benefi tted from an upsurge of popular patriotism that he had helped 
to foster. Th e space shuttle program had been years in the making since the days when 
Americans worried about Sputnik and Soviet leadership in space, but Reagan benefi tted 
from the good will when the fi rst space shuttle was successfully launched in April 
1981. Reagan’s tough line with the Soviet Union pleased anti-Communists, and the 
fact that at the end of his fi rst term he was the fi rst president since Herbert Hoover 
never to have met with a Soviet leader did not worry them. In June 1984, Reagan traveled 
to France for the 40th anniversary of the D-Day landing that ended World War 
II. In a series of events carefully scripted by his communications director, Michael 
Deaver, he led a series of jubilant and patriotism-fi lled celebrations honoring veterans 
and American power. Later that summer, the Olympics were held in Los Angeles, 
and Reagan led the celebrations, emphasizing how far the country had come since the 
boycott of the games in Moscow only 4 years before. Reagan’s wealthy supporters also 
gave him a huge fi nancial edge over Mondale. 
Perhaps most of all, Reagan’s own sunny disposition made people like him. His 
TV ads reinforced Reagan’s message that it was “ Morning Again in America .” His 
optimism was on full display when on March 30, 1981, Reagan was shot while leaving 
a speaking event. His press secretary James Brady was severely wounded and permanently 
disabled. Few knew at the time how seriously the president had been wounded 
when a bullet lodged in his left lung and he bled heavily. But just before entering surgery, 
Reagan looked at his wife, Nancy, and said, “Honey, I forgot to duck,” and then 
asked the surgeons, “Please tell me you’re all Republicans.” Th at sort of pluck made 
him popular even with people who disagreed with his policies. In addition, his speaking 
style was extraordinary. His many years as an actor paid off . His friends called 
him, “Th e Great Communicator,” and even his toughest opponents admired him. Th e 
Democratic Speaker of the House, Tip O’Neill, who tangled with Reagan on many 
occasions, said of him, “He may not be much of a debater, but with a prepared text 
he’s the best public speaker I’ve ever seen.…I’m beginning to think that in this regard 
he dwarfs both Roosevelt and Kennedy.” 
In the November 1984 vote, Reagan carried every state except Mondale’s home 
state of Minnesota and the District of Columbia and won almost 60 percent of 
the popular vote. While Republicans continued to control the Senate 53 to 46, the 
Democrats controlled the House 252 to 182. 
A year after the election, a group of Democrats, including Representative 
Richard Gephardt of Missouri and Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas organized the 
Democratic Leadership Council. Th ese “New Democrats” argued that there was more 
to the election than Reagan’s personal popularity and that the Democratic Party was 
not going to win elections until it moved closer to the conservative mainstream. Th e 
creation of the Democratic Leadership Council was high tribute to the conservative 
shift in American opinion that constituted the heart of the Reagan Revolution and signaled 
a move away from traditional New Deal Democratic values that included significant 
government services, especially for those in need, and support for labor unions. 
As Reagan entered his second term, people expected a repeat of the fi rst. Reagan’s top 
priority remained reducing taxes, and in the mid-1980s, many Democrats agreed. A bipartisan 
coalition passed the Tax Reform Act of 1986 that cut the number of tax brackets from 
14 to two, with tax rates of 15 and 28 percent respectively, while closing many tax loopholes. 
Led by the president, who had begun his term cutting the tax rate for the wealthiest 
Americans from 70 to 50 percent, the government had now cut it to 28 percent. 
Aft er the 1986 tax bill passed, Reagan devoted more and more of his time to foreign 
policy. He continued to appoint conservative judges and to support deregulation and the 
shrinking of the federal government, but he did not present major domestic policy initiatives 
in his last 2 years in offi ce. Reagan had come to offi ce a devout Cold Warrior. But 
before he left offi ce, he presided over the greatest change in U.S.–Soviet relationships since 
Franklin Roosevelt had granted offi cial U.S. recognition to the Soviet Union in the 1930s.

Expanding the Cold War—From Star Wars to Iran Contra 
When Ronald Reagan became president in January 1981, he had virtually no foreign 
policy experience. He was more sophisticated as a politician than many of his detractors 
(and some of his supporters) admitted. Nevertheless, he had not spent much time 
outside of the United States and did not know much about foreign policy. He was 
served by a series of weak national security advisors as well as two secretaries of state, 
two secretaries of defense, and a strong director of central intelligence, William Casey, 
all of whom disliked each other intensely, kept major developments secret from each 
other, and at times implemented contradictory policies. First Lady Nancy Reagan also 
took an active role in policy discussions, especially when she feared that conservative 
ideologues were taking her husband in an unnecessarily hard-line direction. It was 
not an administrative structure leading to crisp and clear decision making. However, 
in the midst of apparent chaos, Reagan himself appeared to have been a far stronger 
leader than perceived, one who determined the main aspects of his foreign policy even 
as he left the details of implementation to others. 
EFFORTS TO UNDERMINE COMMUNISM Reagan had several deeply held beliefs that 
would drive his foreign policy. His fi erce anticommunism, which fi rst developed when he 
battled with perceived Communists in the fi lm industry in the 1940s, was reinforced by 
his religious faith, which was off ended by Communist atheism. His ability to articulate 
that passionate stance against communism had been honed through his speaking career 
for GE and as governor. He saw communism, as he once said, as “the focus of evil in the 
modern world,” and the United States as the exceptional carrier of goodness—the “shining 
city on a hill.” He disliked the longstanding policy of containment that had been at the core 
of American foreign policy from Truman to Carter. He did not want merely to contain 
communism where it was. He wanted to undermine existing Communist governments. 
Despite that fi erce anticommunism, however, Reagan had a far greater horror of 
nuclear war than some of his fellow conservatives. His fi rm belief was that a nuclear 
war could “never be won and must never be fought.” During his fi rst term, he never 
trusted the Soviets enough to engage in serious negotiations, but he was determined to 
avoid nuclear war. 
During his fi rst term, Reagan was harshly critical of the Soviet Union. In a 1983 
speech to Christian evangelicals, Reagan referred to the Soviet Union as “ the evil 
empire .” A year later, in August 1984, thinking that the microphone was turned off , 
Reagan said, “My fellow Americans, I am pleased to tell you today that I’ve signed 
legislation that will outlaw Russia forever. We begin bombing in five minutes.” It 
was a joke, but the Soviets found it frightening. Reagan also ordered a massive arms 
buildup. Worried about U.S vulnerability and believing that any negotiations needed 
to be from a position of strength, Reagan supported annual increases in the military 
budget between 1981 and 1986. He arranged the deployment of new intermediaterange 
missiles in Europe in 1983 and resisted serious talks with Soviet leaders. 
Reagan’s goal of undermining communism where it already existed led also 
to other steps. In 1981, as protest movements spread in Poland and the Polish 
Communist government instituted martial law, Reagan imposed sanctions on Poland 
and on the Soviet Union: an end to landing rights in the United States for the Russian 
airline Aerofl ot, a ban on the sale of equipment for a Soviet natural gas pipeline, and— 
at the petty level—termination of the special parking privileges of Soviet Ambassador 
Anatoly Dobrynin in the State Department garage. Th e administration secretly funneled 
some $20 million to Solidarity, the Polish protest movement, through the 
Vatican Bank, with the approval of Polish Pope John Paul II. 
In March 1983, Reagan, against the almost unanimous advice of his foreign policy 
team who seldom agreed on anything, announced that the United States was going to 
develop a Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) . As the president described it, SDI would 
use U.S. technological know-how to create a series of space stations armed with lasers

Union in particular and all Communist 
countries in general.

that would destroy any enemy missiles fi red at the United States. He thought that the 
long-standing U.S. policy dating to the Eisenhower administration of mutually assured 
destruction in which each superpower had the ability to retaliate aft er a nuclear attack 
was essentially a commitment to mutual suicide. In 1979, Edward Teller, the lead 
scientist in the development of the hydrogen bomb, told Reagan that for all its ability to 
build and launch missiles, the United States had virtually no defense against incoming 
missiles. As president, Reagan was determined to create one, to make Soviet missiles 
“impotent and obsolete.” Reagan was convinced that the United States could do it. 
Senior advisors worried that SDI would be expensive, impractical, and a needless 
escalation of the Cold War. Critics called the whole system “Star Wars,” and worried 
that it would militarize space, drain the treasury, and ultimately turn out to be ineffective. 
Military contractors, however, loved SDI. Th e president was committed, and 
throughout his two terms, research and development of the system continued. 
Only long aft er Reagan left offi ce did it become clear how deeply fearful Soviet 
leaders were of the Reagan rhetoric and arms buildup, especially SDI. The Soviets 
feared that SDI would make them vulnerable to a U.S attack, one they could not 
resist if they could not retaliate. In September 1983, a Soviet satellite mistook blips for 
incoming U.S. missiles and the country went on full military alert. Only the courage 
of a young Soviet offi cer, who believed that there was a computer error and who overrode 
the system, appears to have avoided a World War III with millions of deaths in 
both countries. Th e Cold War had never been so dangerous. 
M ANAGING RELATIONS IN THE MIDDLE EAST As the United States focused on 
the Soviet Union, the Reagan foreign policy advisors also viewed the rest of the world 
through the prism of the Cold War, sometimes with disastrous results. Regarding the 
Middle East, Reagan came to offi ce with a generally pro-Israel point of view, a perspective 
that was supported by many Christian evangelicals in his political base. His team 
believed that Jimmy Carter’s Camp David accords had tilted U.S. policy too closely 
toward Egypt and wanted to correct the balance. At the same time, they saw Israel, 
Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia as U.S. allies and were prepared to sell military aircraft 
to the Saudis and to supply Israel with jet bombers and military hardware. Th eir goal 
was to create a strong buff er in the Middle East against Syria and Iraq, both of which 
were viewed as Soviet client states (see Map 28-1 ). 
MAP 28-1 The United States and the Middle East. Events in the Middle East, Afghanistan, and northern 
Africa involved the United States in a series of crises during the 1980s that would only expand in the 1990s.

28.3 
28.2 
28.1 
In Afghanistan, Reagan expanded the Carter-era eff orts to resist the Soviet occupation. 
In 1983 and 1984, the United States provided signifi cant aid to the Mujahedeen 
opposition whom Reagan called “freedom fi ghters.” In 1985, when the Soviets escalated 
their involvement, Reagan ordered his military to do “what’s necessary to win,” 
and the United States began supplying the Afghan resistance with antiaircraft missiles 
and satellite-based intelligence on Soviet troop movements. Eventually, the Soviets 
withdrew from Afghanistan, leaving the CIA-backed Taliban in control of the country. 
It was a short-term victory but one that came with signifi cant long-term consequences 
not only for the people of Afghanistan but also for the United States. 
In addition, the leader of Libya was cause for concern. Libya’s longtime leader 
Muammar Gaddafi had come to power in 1969, long before Reagan’s time. Most of his 
North African neighbors found him to be a troublemaker, but he especially liked to create 
trouble for the United States. Reagan was determined to respond. In 1981, the U.S. Navy 
conducted exercises off the Libyan coast, and when Libyan jets attacked, the Navy shot 
them down. As terrorism expanded across the Middle East, Reagan was sure Gaddafi was 
behind much of it. When a TWA fl ight was hijacked in June 1985 and a West German 
discotheque was bombed in December of that year, killing one U.S. soldier, Reagan 
retaliated. In April 1986, the United States bombed Gaddafi ’s headquarters in Tripoli, 
destroying much of the Libyan air force and killing some 30 civilians including Gadaffi ’s 
15-month-old adopted daughter. For a time, Libya was quiet, but in December 1988, a 
Pan Am fl ight was blown up over Lockerbie, Scotland, and the plot was again traced to 
Libya. Nevertheless, Gadaffi maintained his hold on power until 2011. 
Although the hostage crisis with Iran ended the day Reagan came to office in 
January 1981, the United States remained hostile to Iran because of the crisis. When Iran 
and Iraq went to war against each other in September 1980, the United States tended to 
wish both sides ill. However, as the war continued, members of Reagan’s National Security 
Council (NSC) became convinced that it might be possible to support moderates within the 
Iranian government and build a new U.S. relationship by supplying Iran with weapons. Th e 
United States also had good reason to believe that Iran had infl uence with forces in Lebanon 
that were holding seven U.S. citizens hostage. NSC staff , led by National Security Advisor 
Robert McFarlane, argued Iran might help free the hostages, which was a high priority 
for the president. Carrying forged Irish passports and traveling under assumed names, 
McFarlane and his deputy, Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North, secretly visited Tehran. In 
spite of U.S. policy never to negotiate for the release of hostages and despite its offi cial arms 
embargo of Iran, the United States sold over 2,000 missiles to Iran in 1985 and 1986. It was 
the beginning of the greatest foreign policy misadventure of the Reagan administration. 
Reagan and his advisers were further pulled into Middle East conflicts when Israel 
invaded Lebanon in June 1982. Israel’s goal was to attack the Palestine Liberation 
Organization (PLO) presence in Lebanon and create a buff er against Syria. Reagan did not 
object, though he tried to get Israel to limit its engagement. Later that year, the United States 
sent a detachment of Marines to join an international peace eff ort in Lebanon. In October 
1983, a truck loaded with TNT drove into the U.S. barracks killing 241 Marines. Americans, 
including the president, were horrifi ed at the loss of life. Th e purpose the Marines were supposed 
to serve was always vague, and aft er the tragedy, the administration announced that 
the Marines were to be “redeployed” to ships off the coast where they moved in 1984. 
In response to the experience in Lebanon, Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger 
and his top military advisor and future chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , Colin Powell, 
craft ed what became known as the Powell Doctrine. Henceforth, they said, U.S. soldiers 
would be sent overseas only as a last resort and only if the mission was clearly 
defi ned, attainable, supported by the public, and included an exit strategy, none of 
which had been true in the case of the deployment in Lebanon. Th e new restrictions 
would be honored more clearly in some cases than others. Toward the end of the 
Reagan administration, when Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and West Bank territories 
under the control of Israel rose up in what they called the intifada (or “shaking off ”), 
the United States did little beyond urge both sides to negotiate.

DEALING WITH PERCEIVED THREATS IN LATIN AMERICA U.S. policy in Central 
America, especially in El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua, was also shaped by the 
Cold War. Since the 1920s, Democratic and Republican administrations depended on 
a series of Latin American dictators to create a safe climate for U.S. business and ensure 
that there was no Communist infl uence in the government of their countries. What 
they did to their own citizens was of less concern to American authorities. By the time 
Reagan had come to offi ce, the longtime dictator in Nicaragua, Anastasio Somoza, had 
been overthrown by a popular uprising, and the totalitarian regime in El Salvador was 
seriously threatened by similar opposition. Fearing Communist infl uence in such popular 
uprisings, the Reagan administration supported the besieged government of El 
Salvador and sought to overthrow the new government of Nicaragua (see Map 28-2 ). 
Jean Kirkpatrick, Reagan’s United Nations ambassador, said that Central America 
was “the most important place in the world for us.” Kirkpatrick also outlined a key 
Reagan policy of diff erentiating between authoritarian governments such as that of 
El Salvador, which Kirkpatrick said could in time be reformed into democracies, and 
totalitarian governments—particularly, the government of the Soviet Union and its 
client states—which she claimed would never change. Under the policy, the United 
States would provide support for the former and opposition to the latter. 
Th e same month as the attack on the Marine barracks in Lebanon, October 1983, Reagan 
ordered U.S. troops into the small Caribbean island nation of Grenada, where a military coup 
had overthrown the previous government. Fearing growing Communist infl uence, and worried 
about U.S. medical students in Grenada, U.S. troops quickly defeated the coup leaders. 
Leaders in other countries and in the United Nations condemned the invasion as a violation 
of international law, but some, in and out of Grenada, were grateful for the U.S. role. 
Even though a majority of the Congress wanted nothing to do with supporting 
Central American dictators or overthrowing governments, the administration was 
determined to see its will done. While rejecting a proposal to invade Cuba, made by

Alexander Haig during his short tenure as secretary of state, Reagan greatly expanded 
military aid and sent military advisers to El Salvador. That support was authorized 
even while government-sanctioned death squads assassinated critics, including the 
Archbishop of San Salvador, Oscar Romero, murdered while he was saying mass in 1980. 
Th e United States also determined to intervene in Nicaragua, where the new socialist 
Sandinista government was committed to land reform. In December 1981, Reagan, 
at the urging of CIA director Casey, authorized $20 million for covert operations to 
support the Nicaraguan “Contras” (or counterrevolutionaries) who sought to overthrow 
the new government. Th e core of the Contra movement was a group of some 
500 followers of Somoza, but it grew to an army of perhaps 10,000 who were trained 
in U.S.-sponsored camps in Honduras and sent back to Nicaragua with U.S.-supplied 
weapons to disrupt the workings of the Sandinista government. By 1984, Reagan was 
calling the Contras “our brothers,” and he remained steadfast in their support. 
By 1984, however, Congress was unhappy with the administration’s Central American 
policy. As early as 1982, Congress passed the Boland Amendment , prohibiting the United 
States from seeking to overthrow the Sandinista government. Since Reagan insisted he was 
simply trying to get them to negotiate, he ignored that stipulation. But in 1984, when it 
came to light that the CIA had mined Nicaraguan ports, members of Congress—not only 
liberals but also conservatives, including Barry Goldwater—were furious. In October 1984, 
Congress passed stricter legislation that cut off all aid to the Contras. 
With what seemed like an iron-clad prohibition of aid to the Contras, U.S. adventures 
in Central America seemed to be at an end. But Reagan did not give up easily. 
Th e president encouraged eff orts of a young National Security staff er, Oliver North, 
to find new sources of aid, though it was never clear how much Reagan knew of 
the details of North’s enterprise. Since Congress had banned government aid to the 
contras, North sought donations from friendly governments in Taiwan, Brunei, and 
Saudi Arabia and from wealthy private U.S. citizens like beer magnate Joseph Coors. 
At least $50 million in such aid was delivered to the Contras. 
Seeking to expand the aid, North and his mentor Casey had what they termed a 
“neat idea.” Th e United States was secretly selling arms to Iran. What if, they thought, 
the United States could make a profi t on the clandestine arms shipments to Iran, and 
then use the funds to support the Contras? Congress would not have to appropriate 
any money, and no one needed to know. 
The complex arrangement did not remain secret for long. In October 1986, an 
American cargo plane loaded with military supplies for the Contras was shot down 
in Nicaragua. The Sandinista government let the world know that, in spite of the 
two Boland Amendments, the United States was still providing signifi cant aid to the 
Contras. A month later a Beirut, Lebanon, newspaper published an account, based on 
Iranian sources, of U.S. arms sales to Iran and the link to hoped-for hostage releases. 
People soon connected the two, and the scandal quickly became known as the “arms 
for hostages” deal or simply as “ Iran-Contra .” Th e matter was serious. In selling arms 
to Iran and in funding the Contras, U.S. laws had been broken, laws that the White 
House clearly knew existed. Some in Congress talked of impeachment. As with Nixon 
at Watergate, the question was “what did the president know and when did he know it.” 
As the details of U.S. activity began to emerge, the president insisted that the government, 
“did not, repeat, did not trade arms or anything else for hostages.” He also asked 
Attorney General Ed Meese to investigate. Oliver North immediately began to shred documents 
in his offi ce. Meese reported to the president that North had, in fact, not only sold 
arms to Iran—presumably to free hostages—but also used the profi ts to aid the Contras. 
National Security advisor John Poindexter met with Reagan, confi rmed that Meese was 
right, and resigned. Reagan asked former Texas Senator John Tower to lead an investigation. 
A special prosecutor, Lawrence Walsh, was appointed, and Congress held hearings. 
Reagan eventually had to admit, “I told the American people I did not trade arms 
for hostages. My heart and best intentions still tell me that it is true, but the facts and 
evidence tell me it is not.” Many were shocked that an administration that talked so

much about law and order was doing so many illegal things. Reagan clearly knew 
about the illegal sale of arms to Iran and the arms-for-hostages deals. Many also suspected 
that he knew about the transfer of funds to the Contras, although that was 
never proved. Poindexter and North insisted that the decision rested with them alone. 
Not everyone was convinced, but no “smoking gun” was found. North managed to 
testify brilliantly before Congress, portraying himself as a well-meaning patriot, and 
though Reagan’s approval rating plummeted, talk of impeachment ended. 
Walsh continued his investigation aft er Reagan left offi ce and eventually secured 
the indictment of several offi cials, but Reagan’s successor George H.W. Bush pardoned 
them. In 1994, Walsh concluded that Reagan probably should have been impeached, 
but by then, he was retired and ill. Iran-Contra seriously damaged Reagan’s reputation. 
As Reagan entered his last 2 years in offi ce, many considered his foreign policy eff orts 
to be a failure. Between 1987 and 1989, however, the president accomplished his great 
foreign policy triumph. 
Ending the Cold War 
During his fi rst term, as Reagan talked tough and launched the arms buildup, he also 
refused to meet with Soviet leaders, in part, because he saw no point in such conversations 
and didn’t trust the Soviets and, in part, because of changes in Soviet leadership. 
Leonid Brezhnev, who had led the Soviet Union since Nikita Khrushchev was deposed 
in 1964, died in 1982. His successor Yuri Andropov died 2 years later, and the next 
leader, Konstantin Cherenko, died a year aft er that. Reagan said, “How am I supposed 
to get anyplace with the Russians…if they keep dying on me?” Th en in 1985, a new 
and very diff erent leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, came to power in the Soviet Union. 
Aft er a succession of hard-line Communists who were aging and ill, Gorbachev 
represented a new younger generation of reform-minded Soviet leaders who saw 
how desperately their country needed change. Top-down Soviet-style planning was 
strangling the economy. Matching the United States in military matters took a huge 
percentage of their nation’s limited wealth. Th e disastrous meltdown of the nuclear 
reactor at Chernobyl just aft er Gorbachev came to offi ce further convinced him of 
the need for change. Gorbachev could be as charming and optimistic as Reagan,

but he was also a devoted Communist and a very tough leader. He called for major 
changes: perestroika , reform of the Soviet economic system while maintaining communism, 
and glasnost , more openness and freedom for Soviet citizens. He quickly 
concluded that matching the U.S. arms buildup was going to bankrupt the Soviet 
Union, and he sought a way to avoid the arms race. 
Aft er his reelection in 1984, Reagan was also ready to talk. By 1985, he had achieved 
the military buildup that he wanted and could negotiate from a position of strength. 
U.S. allies, especially those in Europe who lived on the front line of any confl ict, were 
tired of Cold War tensions and increased pressure on the United States for a diff erent 
policy. Nancy Reagan nudged her husband away from the hard-liners in his administration. 
Reagan also knew that his Cold War credentials gave him room to maneuver 
that another leader might not have. 
By 1985, Reagan and Gorbachev were ready to work together. British Prime Minister 
Margaret Th atcher, known as the Iron Lady because of her ability to stand up to pressure, 
was a close ally and friend of Reagan. She assured him that Gorbachev was someone “with 
whom we can do business.” Reagan and Gorbachev began a private correspondence and 
then met for the fi rst time in November 1985 at Geneva where they agreed in general 
to a reduction in nuclear arms. The following October, they met again at Reykjavik, 
Iceland. Th ere, in a small house on the ocean, they got to know each other. Th ey talked 
about their lives—Gorbachev had once wanted to be an actor—their grandchildren, and 
their hopes for the future. At one point, they frightened their respective staff when they 
reached a tentative agreement to abolish all nuclear weapons by 2000 and then moved 
the date back to 1995. Th at agreement fl oundered over Gorbachev’s insistence that they 
include SDI and Reagan’s refusal. Th e Reykjavik summit ended in anger over Star Wars 
and without any agreement, but the two men had established a personal bond. 
In June 1987, Reagan traveled to Berlin, the fl ashpoint of the Cold War. Facing the 
Berlin Wall at the Brandenburg Gate he demanded, “Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this 
wall!” Th e speech, which sounded much more like Reagan’s old line anticommunism 
than the new thaw in U.S.–Soviet relations, seemed to have been as much an eff ort 
to reassure the president’s conservative critics as an actual demand. But in fact, the 
steps that Reagan and Gorbachev were taking would lead to the end of the wall within 
2 years, just aft er Reagan left offi ce. 
Soon aft er Reykjavik, the Soviet physicist Andrei Sakharov convinced Gorbachev 
that SDI would not work and could safely be ignored. Th e two leaders then authorized 
further negotiations on off ensive weapons that led to a treaty dramatically reducing 
intermediate-range nuclear forces (INF) and to onsite inspections so rigorous that 
they frightened the American CIA. 
Critics in both countries thought the leaders were moving too fast. In the Senate, 
North Carolina’s Jesse Helms tried to stop any new treaty, and Howard Phillips of 
the Conservative Caucus called the president a “useful idiot for Soviet propaganda.” 
Gorbachev, for his part, had to deal with military and civilian attacks for his “capitulationist 
line” toward the United States. Even so, the momentum was not going to be stopped. 
At their next summit in Washington, DC, in December 1987, Reagan signed 
the INF treaty in a well-publicized ceremony, and Gorbachev met and mingled 
with American crowds like a U.S. politician. The two seemed at ease with each 
other. When Reagan included one of his favorite sayings, “trust, but verify,” in his 
remarks, Gorbachev interjected, “You repeat that at every meeting.” People celebrated 
“Gorby fever.” Th e Senate ratifi ed the INF Treaty by a large vote in May 1988. Th e 
two countries also made signifi cant progress in resolving the confl icts in Nicaragua 
and Afghanistan, plans for joint space missions, cultural and student exchanges, and 
emigration and human rights. Th ey jointly sponsored a UN resolution calling for an 
end to the Iran-Iraq war. Th e same month that the Senate ratifi ed the INF treaty, the 
two leaders met for a fourth time in Moscow. Th ey walked through Red Square, called 
each other “old friends,” and talked with Russian citizens. When asked about his 
earlier Cold War speeches, Reagan said they were from “another time, another place.”

Before Reagan left Moscow, the United States and Soviet Union had 
essentially normalized their relationship. For all intents and purposes, 
the Cold War was over. 
The Strained Election of 1988 
As a candidate in the Republican primaries in 1980, George Bush had 
called Ronald Reagan’s economic plans, “voodoo economics.” While 
Democrats had a fi eld day with the term once he became Reagan’s vice 
president, Bush was a loyal member of the Reagan team, so loyal that 
some thought he had disappeared, but those who thought that way 
underestimated him considerably. 
George Herbert Walker Bush was a child of privilege. His father 
was a successful banker and Republican senator from Connecticut. 
Bush attended private schools and expected to attend Yale when 
World War II intervened. While Ronald Reagan made war movies 
in Hollywood for the government, Bush fl ew more than 50 combat 
missions in the South Pacifi c and was shot down twice. Aft er the war, 
he married Barbara Pierce, attended Yale, and then moved to Texas 
to make his fortune in the oil business. He served two terms in the 
House of Representatives from Houston. He was defeated when he 
ran for the Senate in 1970 but was subsequently appointed head of the 
Republican Party, nominal U.S. Ambassador to China aft er the Nixon 
trip, and head of the CIA for Gerald Ford. 
Th e conservative wing of the Republican Party never trusted Bush, 
especially aft er his “voodoo economic” remarks, but also because of his 
lack of enthusiasm for their social issues. Disappointed that Reagan had 
not done more to support the social issues that were near and dear to 
them, some conservatives thought that the 1988 election was their chance. 
And Democrats, convinced that Reagan was more personally popular 
than his programs, believed that the end of his second term would be 
their chance to retake the White House. Neither challenge succeeded. 
In the Republican Party, the conservative but genial Kansas senator 
Robert Dole challenged the vice president. And Pat Robertson, the 
extremely conservative religious broadcaster and head of the Christian Broadcasting 
Network, who had strongly supported Ronald Reagan, now resigned his ordination as 
a Baptist minister and campaigned for the nomination. Robertson felt that it was time 
to take the religious right’s social and cultural issues into a presidential campaign. 
While Bush won the nomination on the fi rst ballot, he embraced many of Dole’s and 
Robertson’s issues, invited a conservative, Indiana senator J. Danforth Quayle—whom 
many considered to be a lightweight—to be his running mate, and made a speech he 
would later regret, telling the Republican convention, “Read my lips. No new taxes.” 
Sensing possible victory, many Democrats sought the nomination. Colorado 
senator Gary Hart, an initial front runner, was forced out of the race after he was 
photographed on the yacht Monkey Business with the model Donna Rice—not his 
wife—sitting on his lap. Th e nomination battle came down to a contest between the 
Reverend Jesse Jackson, a longtime civil rights leader, and Massachusetts governor 
Michael Dukakis. Jackson was extremely popular in some circles and reviled in others. 
He was the fi rst African-American candidate to win presidential primaries in southern 
states, winning fi ve. But in the end, Dukakis won the Democratic nomination. He 
summed up his campaign when he told the Democratic convention, “Th is election is 
not about ideology, it’s about competence.” 
Dukakis entered the fall campaign with a 17-point lead in the polls, a sign that people 
were ready for a change, but the lead quickly evaporated in what turned into a very 
nasty battle. Dukakis’s focus on competence did not make for an inspiring campaign. 
This picture of President Ronald Reagan and Soviet Premier Mikhail 
Gorbachev having a friendly conversation in Moscow’s Red Square 
would have dumbfounded most Americans only a few years earlier.

Reagan promised smaller government

for these landslide victories was that a

When I look out at this convention, I see the face of America: 
Red, Yellow, Brown, Black, and White. We’re all precious in God’s 
sight—the real rainbow coalition.…When I was a child growing up 
in Greenville, South Carolina, and grandmamma could not afford 
a blanket, she didn’t complain…she took pieces of old cloth… 
sewed them together into a quilt, a thing of beauty and power and 
culture. Now, Democrats, we must build such a quilt. 
Farmers, you seek fair prices, and you are right—but you cannot 
stand alone. Your patch is not big enough. 
Workers, you fight for fair wages, you are right—but your patch, 
labor, is not big enough. 
Women, you seek comparable worth and pay equity…Head 
Start, and day care and prenatal care on the front side of life, 
relevant jail care and welfare on the back side of life, you are right— 
but your patch is not big enough. 
Students, you seek scholarships, you are right—but your patch 
is not big enough. 
Blacks and Hispanics, when we fight for civil rights, we are 
right—but our patch is not big enough. 
Gays and lesbians, when you fight against discrimination and a 
cure for AIDS, you are right—but your patch is not big enough.… 
But don’t despair. Be as wise as my grandmamma. Pull the 
patches and the pieces together, bound by a common thread. 
When we form a great quilt of unity and common ground, we’ll 
have the power to bring about health care and housing and jobs 
and education and hope to our Nation. 
We, the people, can win. 
Four years ago the keynote speaker at the Democratic National 
Convention told us that America was a tale of two cities—the 
“haves” and the “have-nots.” The rich and the poor. The upper class 
and the lower class.…The Democrats have given us a clear picture 
of their city. They offer unlimited government, massive transfers of 
wealth from the productive sector of society to the nonproductive, 
and ever-increasing regulation of the daily lives of the people and 
their children. 
In the city of the Democratic Party, the liberal mindset reigns 
supreme. Criminals are turned loose and the innocent are made 
victims. Disease carriers are protected and the healthy are placed at 
great risk. 
In the Democrat’s city, welfare dependency flourishes and no one 
is held accountable for his or her behavior. Society is always to blame. 
In the Democrat’s city, the rights of the majority must always 
take a back seat to the clamorous demands of the special interest 
minorities. And yet, in their city it is always the majority that must 
pay the bills, through higher and higher taxes.… 
Ladies and Gentlemen, the Republican Party wants to write a 
tale of another city. 
We are the children of those who tamed the wilderness, 
spanned a continent, and brought forth the greatest nation on 
the face of the earth.…We see a city set on a hill. A shining light of 
freedom for all of the nations to see and admire. A city made great 
by the moral strength and self-reliance of her people.… 
We are Republicans, and we believe in government that is our 
servant, not our master.

THE CHANGING NATURE OF THE AMERICAN ECONOMY 
Explain international economic developments that shaped the United States. 
Presidential candidates, economists, and families who gathered around the dinner 
table or the TV trays in the living room all debated the nature of the economic changes 
that were taking place in the 1980s as “Reaganomics” led to tax cuts, a reduction in 
government services, and fewer government regulations. Late in his term, in July 
1987, President Reagan proposed what he called an Economic Bill of Rights, which he 
restated on several occasions: 
First is the freedom to work—to pursue one’s livelihood in one’s own way … 
free from excessive government regulation and subsidized government competition;…
freedom to enjoy the fruits of one’s labor…free from excessive government 
taxing, spending and borrowing by the government…the freedom to 
own and control one’s property….freedom to participate in a free market… 
and to achieve one’s full potential without government limits on opportunity. 
It was a philosophy that Reagan seemed to embody in his own life story. Yet by 1987, 
when the president spoke, some Americans were beginning to have second thoughts. 
Kevin Phillips, who helped Republican presidential campaigns from Nixon to 
Reagan, was among them. In his book, Th e Boiling Point , he described what he saw as 
Reagan’s term came to an end. Reagan had been elected in 1980, Phillips said, because 
government was “fairly in disrepute for its swollen size and record of aggravating rather 
than solving problems.” He continued that with the cuts in taxes and government programs, 
however, “[h]igh-income persons did not suff er, but middle-class voters usually 
worried when federal and state reductions went too far” (see Figure 28-1 ). 
One of the striking features of the economy of the 1980s was the extraordinary 
fortunes made by a few individuals. In the 1980s, Ivan Boesky anticipated corporate 
takeovers and mergers, buying stock just before it increased in value with stunning 
regularity. In December 1986, Boesky was honored with a cover photo in Time magazine, 
and by 1987, he had earned a total of more than $200 million. 
Michael Milken, an investor for the fi rm Drexel Burnham Lambert 
who specialized in so-called junk bonds, earned much more. Junk 
bonds were high-risk investments that could pay high yields. Milken 
arranged investments in gambling casinos and technology startups as 
well “leveraged buyouts” in which investors would buy a controlling 
share of a company—using loans arranged by Milken—and thereby 
take it over in spite of the will of its owners and managers. In 1987, his 
estimated income for that one year was $550 million. 
Boesky, Milken, and other slightly lesser fi gures were the heroes 
of the 1980s. In a speech to business students at the University of 
California, Berkeley, Boesky said, “I think greed is healthy. You can 
be greedy and still feel good about yourself.” But Kevin Phillips noted 
that, “By early 1990 Th e New York Times noted that Wall Street found 
an unnerving whiff of populism in the public’s anger over junk-bond 
pioneer Michael Milken’s $550-million-a-year salary.” 
Federal employees at the Security and Exchange Commission 
(SEC) became suspicious that anyone could have as much success as 
Boesky in guessing the direction of stock values year aft er year. A SEC 
investigation showed that Boesky was indeed getting illegal insider 
information about corporate takeovers and mergers. When he was 
charged with breaking the law, Boesky implicated Milken, whose illegal 
dealings were even more complex. Boesky was eventually fi ned $100 
million, half of his fortune, Milken paid over $1.1 billion, and both 
served almost 2 years in federal prison. In the 1987 movie, Wall Street ,

Robert Reich was a respected economist in the 1980s and 
would serve as secretary of labor in the 1990s. As Reagan’s 
term came to a close, Reich looked at the Reagan tax cuts, 
which he argued had certainly shifted money toward the rich. 
However, he also said that there were larger forces at work that 
were reshaping the world’s economy and that the real issue was 
that the United States could not control its economy. In 1991, 
Reich published The Work of Nations in which he said, “We are 
living through a transformation that will rearrange the politics 
and economics of the coming century.…There will no longer 
be national economies, at least as we have come to understand 
that concept.” Trade, finance, indeed the whole job market of the 
planet, Reich insisted, had become a single worldwide economy 
in which national policies mattered much less than in the past. 
“All that will remain rooted within national borders,” Reich said, 
“are the people who comprise a nation.” 
In the new world, Reich believed, some were going to be 
much better off and others worse off. He argued that people 
found themselves in one of three quite different economic categories. 
Those who were employees in the older industries—auto 
or steel workers for example—found themselves with declining 
prospects. Well-paying jobs that had been secure were disappearing 
as manufacturing moved to other countries. A second 
group of workers, those who provided direct services—from selling 
hamburgers to health care workers to teachers—would keep 
their jobs since such services were hard to export, but would 
find their futures relatively flat. And finally, in the third category, 
those Reich called “symbolic analysts” the scientists, inventors, 
developers, and money managers, would do quite well, indeed 
better than ever before. For example, Reich noted: 
In 1960, the chief executive of one of America’s 100 largest 
nonfinancial corporations earned, on average, $190,000 
or about 40 times the wage of his average factory worker. 
After taxes, the chief executive earned only 12 times the factory 
worker’s wages. By the end of the 1980s, however the 
chief executive earned, on average, more than $2 million— 
93 times the wages of his (rarely her) average factory worker. 
After taxes, the chief executive’s compensation was about 
70 times that of the average factory worker. 
Clearly the Reagan tax cuts had something to do with the 
change but not everything. 
For Reich, the larger issue was the shift from a national 
American economy to a unified world economy: 
All Americans used to be in roughly the same economic 
boat. Most rose or fell together, as the corporations in which 
they were employed, the industries comprising such corporations, 
and the national economy as whole became more 
productive—or languished. But national borders no longer 
define our economic fates. We are now in different boats, 
one sinking rapidly [the industrial workers], one sinking more 
slowly [service workers], and the third rising steadily [that of 
managers and inventors]. 
In the economy that Reich described, Americans would compete, 
not with each one another, but with people in the same 
sort of work around the world. Not everyone agreed with Reich, 
but it was hard to look at the nation at the end of the 1980s and 
not conclude that some, indeed, were sinking and others were 
rising quite spectacularly.

In 1980, the average crossed the magic 1,000 line to 1,100, and from there it just kept 
going up along with public optimism. By 1987, the average was above 2,500. Th en in 
October 1987, the bottom fell out as it had done before. On October 19, known as “Black 
Monday,” the market fell by 508 points, closing below 2,000. Th e next day, the Federal 
Reserve Bank, seeking to avoid a repeat of the 1929 crash, responded, pumping millions 
of dollars into the market. Consumer confi dence returned and the market stabilized,

but in one day, American stocks had dropped $500 billion in their value, and many 
investors lost their savings. 
Among the victims of Black Monday was the nation’s savings and loan industry. In 
1982, as part of the Reagan eff orts to deregulate government, most of the restrictions 
on savings and loan associations were removed. Th ey were allowed to invest not only 
in houses and cars, which they had long done, but also in risky oil and gas ventures, 
real estate developments, and even junk bonds like those sold by Michael Milken. Th ey 
attracted many more depositors by paying previously unheard of high levels of interest.

junk bonds, and then housing prices collapsed in the late 1980s, the savings and loan 
industry found itself in serious trouble with investments that were not worth what they 
owed to depositors. Some 1,200 of the nation’s 4,000 savings and loans required federal 
help or went out of business. Since the federal government guaranteed savings and loan 
deposits as they did bank deposits, the government—and taxpayers—were left with the 
cost, which came to $500 billion or $2,000 for every American. Further investigations 
showed that U.S. senators had done special favors for the savings and loan industry and 
six senators were censured. Savings and loan owners who made fortunes were found to 
have stolen from their companies. William Crawford, a California offi cial charged with 
investigating the scandal, said, “Th e best way to rob a bank is to own one.” 
CHANGES IN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY 
Explain cultural changes in the United States during the 1980s. 
On April 5, 1985, 3 months aft er Reagan’s second inauguration, Michael Jackson, the most 
successful American rock star of the 1980s, joined in a concert, originally planned by Bob 
Geldof and Midge Ure, Irish and Scottish musicians, to raise funds for famine relief in Africa. 
Th e concert was broadcast around the world and raised $44 million in a production which 
included Jackson, Lionel Richie, Bob Dylan, Ray Charles, Billy Joel, Cyndi Lauper, Bette 
Midler, Willie Nelson, Paul Simon, Bruce Springsteen, Stevie Wonder, and Tina Turner.

Th ree months later, on July 13, 1985, some 100,000 people attended one of two 
simultaneous rock concerts held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and London, England. 
Another 1.5 to 1.9 billion people around the world watched the concerts on TV or 
listened on radio. At the July concert, Jackson, his guests, and an audience of many 
million sang We Are the World . 
Th ese Live Aid concerts eventually raised over $80 million for Africa. Subsequent 
concerts raised more money. They also symbolized new international connections. 
Without a time lag, people could listen to the same concert at the same time. Th ey could 
also transfer money, hold meetings, and plan new enterprises, creating a worldwide 
culture and economy. Given the speed of travel, it did not take much longer for people 
to visit new places, transmit diseases, or start a new life halfway around the world. 
Popular Culture—Music, Television, Theater 
In addition to the fundraising—which was badly needed—the 1985 concerts also symbolized 
the way American rock musicians had come to dominate the world. Michael 
Jackson, Bruce Springsteen, and Cyndi Lauper fi rst emerged in the 1970s and 1980s. 
They were joined in these concerts by others, Ray Charles, Bob Dylan, and Tina 
Turner, some of whom had been international fi gures since the 1950s. Th ey represented 
diverse musical styles from Turner’s start in rhythm-and-blues to Charles’s jazz, 
to Lauper’s rock, but all had become cultural icons across the United States, in major 
world capitals, and in isolated rural villages in Asia, Africa, and tiny Pacifi c islands. 
Th e popularity of American music and American musicians was made possible, 
in part, by rapidly changing technologies. Michael Jackson insisted that We Are the 
World be released at exactly 3:50 p.m. Greenwich Mean Time (10:50 a.m. on the East 
Coast of the United States) in 8,000 radio stations around the world. Th e technology 
to transmit the music to all of these stations was new. When the Live Aid concerts 
were held in July 1985, one of the musicians, Phil Collins, managed to perform in 
person at both the London and the Philadelphia concerts thanks to the supersonic 
concord plane that brought him across the Atlantic faster than the speed of sound. 
Music Television (MTV) began broadcasting in August 1981 and built a worldwide 
audience for rock music. Generating these huge audiences would not have happened 
without the nonstop broadcasting of music videos aimed at audiences in the 12- to 
34-year-old demographic who made up the bulk of those who attended the concerts 
or listened to the broadcasts. And aft er We Are the World had been released, it and 
Rock Group Duran Duran, musicians Lionel Richie, Dionne Warwick, actors Jeff Bridges and Chevy Chase, 
singers Bob Dylan and Harry Belafonte performing at “Live Aid ‘85“ Concert on July 13, 1985, at J.F.K. Stadium 
in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 

882 Part IX Certainty, Uncertainty, and New Beginnings, 1980–To The Present 
other music from the concerts was listened to over and over by individuals using Sony 
Walkman personal stereos, first sold in 1979, or Sony compact disc (CD) players, 
which produced far better quality than older tapes and records. American music of 
the 1980s could be heard worldwide because American—and Japanese—technology 
made possible the easy and cheap distribution of quality musical sounds. 
Th e music of the 1980s also connected with Americans, especially young Americans, 
and their counterparts around the globe. It was their generation’s challenge to the traditional 
culture and its music. Where jazz, rock, and folk music all began as protests, against 
musical and political systems, so the music of the 1980s was its own forms of protest. 
African-American artists dominated the music, but they were not alone. Tina Turner, an 
African-American, who with her husband had headlined the Ike and Tina Turner Revue 
in the 1950s and 1960s, emerged aft er her divorce as a force in her own right in the 1980s, 
celebrating her energy and her sexuality with recordings like Private Dancer in 1984. A 
younger white woman, Madonna, celebrated her sometimes off-the-wall sexuality in 
releases like her 1984 album, Like a Virgin . A new generation, the children of the baby 
boomers, was creating a new music and a new culture of its own in the 1980s and making 
sure that its country, and the world, listened. 
Th e 1980s were one of the most successful decades in the history of the fi lm industry. 
Th e most popular fi lm of the decade was E.T., the Extra-Terrestrial , a story produced by 
Steven Spielberg about a small creature from outer space who liked candy and wanted to 
“phone home.” Other highly successful fi lms of the decade included Th e Empire Strikes 
Back (1980), Return of the Jedi (1983) in George Lucas’s Star Wars trilogy; Batman ; 
Ghostbusters ; and the Indiana Jones movies, Raiders of the Lost Ark (all in 1981) and 
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989). Th ere were also more violent movies such 
as Terminator (1984) with Arnold Schwarzenegger and the Rambo fi lms with Sylvester 
Stallone. While both Schwarzenegger and Stallone played classic “good guys,” the fi lms 
had plenty of blood and violence. Spike Lee directed fi lms like Do the Right Th ing, which 
explored serious issues in a thoughtful way. Martin Scorsese’s Th e Last Temptation of 
Christ, released in 1988, generated critical acclaim but also demonstrations in front of 
theaters, with its portrayal of Jesus as a man with ordinary temptations. As with music, 
so with films, technology expanded beyond anything previously thought possible. 
People still watched movies in theatres, but they also watched them at home as VCRs 
made it possible for fi lms to be distributed, not only to the local theatre but also to the 
local living room where people could watch at their leisure. 
The most successful TV series of the 1980s, the Bill Cosby Show, reflected an 
updated version of the 1950s family shows. But the family in the Cosby show, the 
Huxtables, was led by an African-American doctor, played by Cosby. Th e focus on 
a successful African-American family in the mainstream of America, and their 
warm acceptance by viewers, was a clear shift . In contrast, when the lead character 
of Murphy Brown , played by Candice Bergen, had a child without being married and 
indicated that the father’s identity was not important, the vice president of the United 
States, Dan Quayle, criticized the show. 
African-American artists and writers also came to play a dominant role in theater 
and literature in the 1980s. Th e playwright August Wilson began producing a series 
of plays that explored the black experience from 1900 to 2000, including Ma Rainey’s 
Black Bottom in 1985 and Fences in 1986. Toni Morrison’s novel, Beloved , published in 
1987, explored the evils of slavery and eventually won the Nobel Prize for Literature. 
Culture Wars—The Christian Coalition and Other Critics 
Th e cultural developments of the 1980s and 1990s in music, drama, and creative writing 
also produced a considerable critical response. Looking at the era, Robert Bork, 
a conservative legal scholar who had been denied a position on the Supreme Court 
by a Senate vote in 1987, published Slouching Toward Gomorrah in 1996 in which he 
blamed a decline he saw in American culture on the nation’s “enfeebled hedonistic 
28.3 
28.1 
28.2 

Chapter 28 The Reagan Revolution 883 
culture,” its “uninhibited display of sexuality,” and “popularization of violence.” Many 
other authors, liberal and conservative, worried about what the liberal African- 
American journalist Carl Rowen called the “sexual rot and gratuitous violence” that 
led to “decadence, decay, and self-destruction” in the United States. In 1985, “Tipper” 
Gore, whose husband was then Democratic Senator from Tennessee, co-founded the 
Parents Music Resource Center aft er hearing her 11-year-old daughter listen to music 
by the recording artist Prince that she deemed profane. 
Th e religious right was made up of people who were increasingly angry at many 
of the cultural trends of the 1980s and 1990s. Th e Moral Majority, the major political 
organization of the religious right, declined in the late 1980s and disbanded in 1989 
(see Chapter 27 ) . It had fallen victim to some of the more extremist statements of its 
founder Jerry Falwell as well as institutional mismanagement. Some commentators 
thought that decline would be the end of religious conservatism as a political force. 
Th ey could not have been more mistaken. Aft er Pat Robertson lost his campaign for 
the Republican nomination in 1988, he helped launch a new conservative religious 
and political organization: the Christian Coalition. 
While launching the Christian Coalition, Robertson hired a young veteran of the 
College Republican National Committee, Ralph Reed, to run the organization on a 
day-to-day basis. Reed brought a steady hand as well as organizational and fundraising 
skills to the Christian Coalition that the Moral Majority never had. He was 
a young fresh face and managed to portray himself as a moderating infl uence on the 
more extreme Robertson. 
Pat Robertson was born in 1930. His father was a conservative Democratic 
U.S. senator from Virginia from 1946 to 1966. Robertson earned a law degree from 
Yale before studying for the Baptist ministry. He founded the Christian Broadcasting 
Network and The 700 Club , a religious talk show that reached millions, before he 
began his more overt political campaigning. In running for president and then launching 
the Christian Coalition, Robertson sought to resist what he saw as the increased 
secularization of American culture and avert what he saw as God’s coming judgment 
on the nation’s sins. Another evangelical minister, describing Robertson’s supporters, 
said, “Th ey have a bunker mentality. Th ey feel modernity is against them—in matters 
dealing with sex, crime, pornography, education.” 
Ralph Reed, born in 1961, was a generation younger than Robertson. As a 
student, he was fascinated with the mechanics of politics and initially put off by 
the religious right because of their amateurishness. He was determined that the 
Christian Coalition would be an eff ective organization. Th e two made a strong team. 
By 1992, the Christian Coalition had more than 150,000 members and controlled 
the grass-roots Republican Party in several southern states. 
By the mid-1990s, every Republican candidate for president was 
courting the Christian Coalition and Reed could say, “We have gained 
what we have always sought, a place at the table, a sense of legitimacy.” 
His goal was more than legitimacy, however. Read and Robertson 
wanted to shape the nation’s political agenda, from the grass roots up 
as much as from the top down. Pat Buchanan, who served as an advisor 
to Reagan in the 1980s and sought the Republican nomination in 
the 1990s, told Reed, “You just keep working on those school board 
races and leave the presidency to me.” Buchanan never won a presidential 
nomination, but Reed told the National Press Club “Th ere are 
an estimated 2,000 religious conservatives who now serve on school 
boards, city councils, state legislatures, and in Congress.” Th eir impact 
throughout the 1990s testifi ed to the coalition’s power. 
Religious conservatives were not the only critics of American culture 
in the 1980s and 1990s. Robert Bellah, a liberal sociologist, argued in his 
1986 book Habit of the Heart that Americans were becoming so individualistic 
and consumption oriented that they were losing their ability to 
Opposition to abortion became one of the major rallying cries of the 
growing religious right.

work together for the common good. A decade later in 1995, a Harvard scholar, Robert 
Putnam, published Bowling Alone in which he explored the impact of individualism. 
Americans who, in the past, joined churches, social and service organizations, and bowling 
leagues, now stayed home to watch television, spent less time in face-to-face gatherings 
of any sort, and even if they went out to a bowling alley, now did it alone. Some critics 
thought that Putnam and Bellah romanticized the past, but few dismissed their worries. 
New Immigrants, New Diversities 
In the 1980s and 1990s many who lived in the United States were very recent arrivals. 
In 2000, 28.4 million people, or 10.4 percent of the population of the United States, 
were foreign born. Th is increase was a signifi cant change from the 4.7 percent who 
were foreign born in 1970 and marked the end of almost 50 years of very tough immigration 
restrictions. Immigrants they came in growing numbers in every decade. 
When Congress passed and Lyndon Johnson signed the Immigration and Nationality 
(Hart-Cellar) Act in 1965, no one expected it to have a major impact on the overall 
numbers of people coming to the United States (see Chapter 21 ) . Th ey could not have 
been more wrong. Th e 1965 law capped the number of immigrants at the same place 
as the older law, however, it was designed to make the process fairer. In addition to 
the numerical limits in the 1965 law, it provided for family reunion. If one member of 
a family was a legal resident or citizen of the United States, then that member could 
bring his or her family, regardless of the caps. By the 1990s, two-thirds of all immigrants 
to the United States were coming as part of family reunions. 
Offi cial government numbers showed the impact of the changes brought about by 
the law: 
4.5 million immigrants in the 1970s 
7.3 million immigrants in the 1980s 
9.1 million immigrants in the 1990s 
In addition, by most estimates, between 250,000 and 350,000 came to the United 
States every year without offi cial documentation. In 2000, the U.S. population stood at 
281 million, including some 28 million who had come between 1970 and 2000—more 
individuals than at any other 30-year time span in the nation’s history. 
Th e new immigrants who came between 1970 and 2000 also came from places different 
from immigrants of earlier eras. Before 1924, when the United States virtually 
closed its doors to immigrants (see Chapter 26 ) , most immigrants had come from 
Europe and, unwillingly, from Africa. Aft er 1980, most new immigrants came from 
Latin America and Asia. Between 1980 and 2000, 
2 million people came to the United States from Europe (mostly from former 
Soviet states); 
5.7 million people came from Asia; 
4 million people came from Mexico; 
2.8 million people came from other parts of Central America, and the Caribbean; 
1 million came from South America; 
600,000 came from Africa; and 
250,000 came from Canada. 
By any counting they were reshaping the country. 
Immigrants moved to every part of the United States. Meatpacking plants in 
Kansas, potato farms in Maine, and agribusiness in southern Indiana all depended 
on recent immigrants who were willing to do hot, dirty, and generally low-paying 
work. Th e majority of immigrants, however, settled in relatively few areas, especially 
the states of California, Texas, Florida, New Jersey, Illinois, and New York. By 2000, 
California’s population was 27 percent foreign-born as a result of a major infl ux of 
new immigrants and a modest white exodus. 
28.3 
28.1 
28.2 

Chapter 28 The Reagan Revolution 885 
Many immigrants also came to the United States without offi cial approval. Th e borders 
with Mexico and Canada were hard to guard and many simply walked across. Others 
came on tourist visas and never left . In 1986, Congress passed legislation that President 
Reagan signed, giving anyone who had been in the United States since 1982 the right to 
seek amnesty, and 1.7 million people, most from Mexico, took advantage of the law. 
Debates about immigration became intense. In campaigning for the Republican presidential 
nomination in 1992, Patrick Buchanan staked out the anti-immigrant views in the 
strongest terms. He said, “Our own country is undergoing the greatest invasion in its history, 
a migration of millions of illegal aliens yearly from Mexico.…A nation that cannot 
control its own borders can scarcely call itself a state any longer.” In 1986, almost threequarters 
of California voters approved a law that made English the “offi cial language” of 
the state. While the law had little formal meaning, it was a slap at those who spoke other 
languages. Some labor union leaders and workers, white and black, complained that new 
immigrants were taking their job or depressing wages in whole industries. 
On the other hand, defenders of immigration argued that the American economy 
was dependent on immigrants who were willing to take jobs—in restaurants, agriculture, 
and home health care—that few native-born Americans were willing to do. 
Would the crops get harvested, the meat packaged, the dishes washed, and the elderly 
cared for if immigrants, documented and undocumented, were forced to leave? 
Immigrants are generally younger than the average population, pay taxes, and contribute 
to the Social Security system, though in the case of those who are undocumented, 
they may never collect benefits. Some studies, they argued, indicate that 
immigrants are more highly educated, more likely to be in stable families, and less 
likely to be engaged in crime, though other scholars disputed those numbers. While 
the arguments continued, people kept coming. 
American Indians in the 1980s—Casinos and Rebirth 
While their numbers were drastically reduced by war and disease, American Indian 
tribes have survived and sometimes thrived in spite of the diffi culties. As restrictions 
on teaching American Indian languages, culture, and religion were lift ed in the 1940s, 
1950s, and 1960s, a surprising reservoir of an earlier cultural heritage resurfaced. For

N o single immigrant experience stands for the hundreds of 
thousands of people who have moved from crisis, poverty, or 
war to make new lives in the United States. These brief interviews 
with Caridad Rios, a 40-year-old native of Lake Chapala, Jalisco, 
Mexico; Adela Aguirre, also from Mexico; and Saša Savić from the 
former Yugoslavia describe some common experiences . 
Caridad Rios: I don’t believe I’ll ever return to my country, 
because of them [her children]. Because how could I leave them? 
For better or worse they need their mother here, even if they’re 
grown…This country is made up of immigrants. From the earliest 
times, immigrants came.…This country belongs to the whole 
world.…I have worked, now I am receiving food stamps, but who 
cares? I have worked, I have contributed here. 
Adela Aguirre [speaking of Chinese immigrant women at the 
workshop she attended] The first time…that I began to notice, 
that I said that yes, they also feel bad, they also have problems. 
They also go through what I’m going through, so Adela, what are 
you complaining about? Yes. That was when I began to get more 
interested in everything. It was when I began to pay more attention 
to them. Because I said, I have to learn from them. I have to 
learn a lot from all my companeras , but even more from them [the 
Chinese women]. First of all, because they are another, they are 
another nationality, they have other customs, they have another 
language. And maybe the nicest thing they made me learn was 
just that, that I realized that there are people, of whatever origin 
or whatever nationality that will help you, will motivate you. 
Saša Savić Basically I was raised in a middle-class family in the 
former Yugoslavia. My father was an officer in the army. So when 
I finished high school I served in the army, because it was mandatory 
for everybody to serve for 1 year. So I did that and coming 
out of the army there was a lot of political problems in the 
country. The country was in turmoil; everybody wanted to separate 
from each other. So since I’m from a mixed marriage—my 
father is Serbian and my mother Croatian—it was impossible to 
choose a side and say, ‘okay, I want to fight in the Serbian army 
against Croatians or the Croatian army against Serbian. So we 
decided to elope; my girlfriend at the time and I decided to get 
married and to try to come to this country. It was very hard to get 
a visa at the time.…Because we said we wanted to go there on 
our honeymoon, we were granted a visitor visa.

United States 
some tribes, Coyote is the perfect symbol of Indian life. Coyote is the trickster who 
disappears and reappears as he needs to in order to survive and thrive in new contexts. 
At the Spirit Mountain Casino, which is operated by the Grand Ronde Reservation in 
western Oregon State, a picture of Coyote dominates the gambling hall and the tribal 
logo. It is a fi tting symbol. 
Gambling transformed many American Indian communities in the 1980s. While 
oft en a subject of derision, gambling brought prosperity to many tribes that had experienced 
only poverty since their first engagement with Europeans. Two federal court 
cases, Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Butterworth in 1981 and California v. Cabazon Band of 
Mission Indians in 1987, made it diffi cult for states to limit gambling on Indian reservations. 
Some of those who controlled the gambling industry did not like the idea of new 
competitors, and Donald Trump complained about “equal treatment under the law.” But 
the United States had always used a diff erent set of laws for Indians, and treaty rights created 
a unique situation. In the court cases, tribes and their attorneys argued that the treaty 
rights creating the reservations gave them all the powers of any sovereign state to handle 
their own aff airs. To regularize the new industry that was emerging, Congress passed the 
Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) in 1988, and Reagan signed it. While the court 
cases and legislation did not give the tribes unlimited control over their own aff airs, a new 
industry was born, one that brought prosperity to some, though not to others.

Chapter 28 The Reagan Revolution 887 
By 1994, 72 tribes were operating gambling operations in half of the states, and many 
more were planned. Th e gross income of these operations, $1.5 billion, was only a tiny 
fraction of the $330 billion the Americans spent on gambling, but it was a huge new 
source of income for tribes that had existed for generations on the economic margins. 
The Pequots Foxwoods Casino produced almost $900 million in 1994, and the 
tribal council used the money to create other job-producing enterprises, including a 
silica mine and a printing plant. Th ey bought the former Electric Boat shipyard that 
helped maintain the U.S. nuclear submarine fl eet. Th eir goal was long-term economic 
development that was not dependent only on the gambling industry. Other tribes 
did the same. Th e Oneida Tribe of Wisconsin used the income from its slot-machine 
complex near Green Bay to open a chain store and a high-tech research and development 
fi rm. Th e Choctaws of Oklahoma used income from a bingo parlor in Durant to 
build a manufacturing plant, hotels, and the Choctaw Nation Travel Plaza that earned 
$1.4 million per month in 1992. 
Th e new wealth allowed tribes to design their own museums, support retention 
of tribal languages, and maintain aspects of their culture that were otherwise being 
lost. Th ey also allowed tribes to expand schools, provide new job training programs 
and health services, and generally support their members at a higher level. Promises 
of wealth also led some to “rediscover” their Indian identity. Indians who had 
drift ed away from reservations were now returning, a change since the 1950s when a 
government Urban Relocation Program had led perhaps half of all American Indians 
to move from reservations to cities. Others who were part Indian were now claiming 
their Indian ties. Determining who was, and was not, a member of a specifi c tribe 
became a complex issue for some. R. David Edmunds, an ethnohistorian who himself 
is part Cherokee, wrote that traditionally no one questioned tribal membership, 
“If the Shawnees said you were Shawnee, you were Shawnee.” By the 1990s, however, 
such issues had become more complex, and tribes sometimes had to make diffi cult 
decisions. Nevertheless, the new prosperity was signifi cant. 
AIDS and the Gay Community 
In 1980, Acquired Immune Defi ciency Syndrome (AIDS) was an unknown disease. In 
June 1981, the Center for Disease Control (CDC), the U.S. government’s key agency 
for monitoring the spread of disease, reported AIDS for the fi rst time. Later studies 
found that AIDS may have infected people in the United States as early as 1969, but 
only in the 1980s did Americans learn about what would quickly become a terrible 
new scourge, fi rst identifi ed among gay men. 
By May 1982, the New York Times carried a story, “New homosexual disorder worries 
offi cials.” At fi rst, health offi cials did not know what the disease was. Th ey were 
starting to discover that a cluster of symptoms were appearing in certain groups of 
people, especially homosexual men and intravenous drug users, but it took some time 
to understand what was happening. Th e symptoms were terrible: tumors, breathing 
diffi culty, diffi cult digestion, and eventually, death. By 1984, researchers discovered 
the infectious agent, the human immunodefi ciency virus (HIV), and understood that 
they were not dealing with a few isolated cases but, rather, a growing worldwide pandemic. 
In 1985, the CDC recorded 5,600 deaths from AIDS. Th ree years later, 61,816 
died of AIDS. By then, researchers had also concluded that HIV was spread through 
contact with bodily fl uids, especially but not exclusively through sex or through sharing 
needles or even blood transfusions that brought the blood of an infected person 
into contact with another. People with many sexual partners and people who routinely 
shared needles were especially susceptible. HIV, they also concluded, could not 
be spread by a hug, by touching the same material, or through the air, but many people 
panicked and would not come near anyone suspected of carrying the disease. 
As HIV-AIDS spread—the CDC confirmed 98,835 cases by 1988—the famous 
and the unknown were afflicted. The actor Rock Hudson, who often played tough

heterosexual male roles but was gay, announced in July 1985 that he had been suffering 
from AIDS since 1984. Many, including Hudson’s good friend Ronald Reagan, 
were stunned. Hudson died in 1985. Arthur Ashe, a famous tennis star, announced in 
April 1992 that he had contracted AIDS through a blood transfusion in the mid-1980s 
and he died in February 1993. In 1987, a previously unknown teenager, Ryan White, 
became a national voice for AIDS victims. White, who suff ered from hemophilia, had 
contracted AIDS from blood treatments, but was then ostracized and expelled from 
school in his hometown of Kokomo, Indiana. He died in April 1990. White’s gentle 
personality made him a hero. In addition to White, Ashe, and Hudson, thousands of 
other Americans were suff ering and dying. In some communities with large groups of 
gay men, especially San Francisco’s Castro district and New York City’s Greenwich 
Village, it seemed as if a whole community was dying, and those who survived spent 
their time caring for the sick and attending funerals. 
As people understood more about the disease, they also turned to the federal government 
for action. Th e government could not stop AIDS, but it could fund research 
that might lead to treatment and cure. Th e government could also spread information 
more eff ectively than any other agency, especially as it became known that using 
condoms during sex resulted in signifi cantly safer if not completely safe sex and that 
using sterilized needles and not sharing them off ered signifi cant protection for drug 
users. But the call for government action crashed into the ideology of many of the 
leading players in the Reagan administration. Th e president’s director of communications, 
Patrick Buchanan, had once said, “Th e poor homosexuals. Th ey have declared 
war on nature and now nature is exacting an awful retribution.” Other Reagan supporters, 
including Secretary of Education William Bennett, may not have agreed with 
Buchanan, but they strongly opposed supporting condom use. Requests by scientists 
at the CDC for more research funds were routinely denied. 
When the U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, himself very conservative on matters 
of sex education, decided that it was his duty to get information out to the public 
on the dangers of AIDS and how to reduce those dangers, he said he realized, “I would 
have to skate fast on thin ice to get by political appointees who placed conservative ideology 
over saving lives.” Aft er Koop issued his fi rst report, members of the Domestic 
Policy Council suggested “revisions” that Koop believed would undermine its eff ectiveness. 
Only in 1987 did Reagan speak publically about AIDS for the fi rst time. Breaking 
a silence that had irritated many, including Nancy Reagan, the president called AIDS 
“public enemy Number One,” but he continued to refuse to acknowledge or meet Ryan 
White or mention condoms until aft er he left offi ce in 1989. 
Gay activists became increasingly militant. In the fall of 1987, ACT-UP (AIDS 
Coalition to Unleash Power) staged a massive demonstration of 500,000 people 
in New York City. In addition, ACT-UP and other organizations, including the 
American Foundation for AIDS Research, continued to lobby for better public education, 
which in the 1990s was very eff ective. Eventually in 1992, Congress appropriated 
approximately $2 billion for AIDS research. While no cure or medical prevention has 
yet been discovered, important advances in the treatment of AIDS came as a result. 
AIDS had once been a death sentence, but by 2000, many with AIDS were living long 
and full lives as long as they continued to monitor their treatments carefully. In combining 
issues of medical science, health, sexuality, and drug use, the AIDS epidemic 
illustrated a tangle of cultural issues facing the nation as it entered the 1990s.

Chapter 28 The Reagan Revolution 889 
CONCLUSION 
Th e Reagan Revolution began in 1980 when Ronald Reagan defeated Jimmy Carter in 
his presidential bid for reelection. Reagan, supported by a broad coalition of workingclass 
whites, suburbanites, and social conservatives, came to offi ce with three key priorities: 
increase military spending, cut domestic spending and social programs, and 
cut the federal income tax. During the Reagan administration, all three goals were 
met, and both political parties, the Republicans and the Democrats, became more 
conservative. Many New Deal structures and programs were eliminated or drastically 
modifi ed, and the combination of tax cuts and military spending increased the 
national debt signifi cantly. 
Reagan and his advisors rejected the idea that federal spending was the best way 
to stimulate a sluggish economy. Instead, they sought to foster private investment and 
create new jobs by cutting taxes. Relying on what they called supply-side economics, 
Reagan drastically reduced both taxes and domestic expenditures. Reagan’s initiatives, 
at fi rst, did very little to improve the nation’s economy. During his fi rst term, unemployment, 
infl ation, and the national debt all rose steadily. But, by 1983, the economy, 
in the eyes of most Americans, was improving. Although the stock market was strong 
throughout much of Reagan’s presidency, the bottom fell out in 1987. By the late 
1980s, several economic events, including the savings and loan crisis, suggested that 
the U.S. economy was in trouble again. 
Reagan came to offi ce with very little foreign policy experience, but he quickly 
focused on destabilizing existing Communist governments and acted to prevent the 
spread of communism, especially in Latin America. As a result, the United States 
intervened in both overt and covert ways in many countries in the Middle East and 
Latin America. Later in his administration, the eff orts to build new contacts within 
Iran and to fund the opposition to the Nicaraguan government led to what was known 
as the Iran-Contra scandal that seriously undermined the administration’s credibility 
and foreign policy record. As part of his anticommunism agenda, Reagan also initiated 
the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), or Star Wars, with the intention of destroying 
any Soviet missiles in space before they could strike the United States. While SDI 
greatly troubled the Soviets, it was never a viable technology, and despite his hardline 
stance against communism, Reagan forged a diplomatic relationship with Soviet 
leader Mikhail Gorbachev. Before he left offi ce, Reagan and Gorbachev had essentially 
brought the 40-year-long Cold War to an end. 
In the 1980s, the culture wars began to dominate American politics as technological 
changes brought the world closer together and new forms of music and entertainment 
dominated the culture. At the same time, the Christian Coalition gained 
increasing power and infl uence. Th e religious conservatives of the Christian Coalition 
were alarmed by liberalizing cultural trends and by the ways that immigration was 
transforming the country. By the end of the decade, the country had been rocked by 
the AIDS epidemic, which some tried to ignore but which was, indeed, one of the 
great public health crises in history.

A RAPIDLY CHANGING U.S. GOVERNMENT 
28.1 Explain Reagan’s impact on the United States and the world. 
Summary 
As an actor and spokesman for General Electric, Ronald Reagan 
developed his talent for connecting with audiences. Th at talent 
proved enormously valuable when Reagan entered politics. 
Reagan’s two terms as governor of California established him 
as a major player in conservative politics. His victory in the 
1980 presidential election was built on diverse coalition that 
included three main groups: disaff ected working-class whites, 
antitax and regulation suburbanites, and social conservatives. 
As president, Reagan had three priorities: increase military 
spending, cut domestic spending and social programs, and cut 
the federal income tax. Reagan also pursued staunch antiunion 
policies as president. Relying on supply-side economics, Reagan 
argued that tax cuts would actually increase government revenue. 
Reagan was able to implement much of his tax and spending 
program, but instead of increasing government revenue it 
led to ballooning defi cits. An improving economy, a surge in 
popular patriotism, and Reagan’s skill as a campaigner propelled 
him to a landslide victory in the election of 1984. Much 
of his second term was dominated by foreign policy. Reagan’s 
foreign policy was shaped by anticommunism and a desire to 
reduce the threat to the United States posed by nuclear weapons. 
Both priorities were refl ected in Reagan’s Strategic Defense 
Initiative (SDI). Th e Reagan administration tended to see developments 
in the Middle East and Latin America through the 
prism of the Cold War, and pursued policies that were meant 
to counter Soviet expansion and infl uence. Reagan’s eff orts to 
evade legal restrictions on U.S. aid to anticommunism forces in 
Nicaragua and on the sale of arms to Iran led to the Iran-Contra 
scandal. Th e rise of Mikhail Gorbachev to power in the Soviet 
Union created an opportunity for Reagan to make real progress 
in nuclear arms reduction. Negotiations between the two 
leaders resulted in important reductions in intermediate range 
nuclear missiles and to the normalization of relations between 
the United States and the Soviet Union. Running a campaign 
that embraced the conservative social and economic agenda, 
George H.W. Bush defeated Democrat Michael Dukakis in the 
1988 presidential election.

THE CHANGING NATURE OF THE AMERICAN ECONOMY 
28.2 
Explain international economic developments that shaped the 
United States. 
Summary 
By the end of Reagan’s second term, some Americans were 
beginning to have second thoughts about the benefits of tax 
cuts and deregulation. Th e immense fortunes accumulated by 
a small number of individuals inspired both admiration and 
concern as income inequality increased in the United States. 
Deregulation contributed to insider trading and the collapse of 
the savings and loan industry. Th e cost of such fi nancial malfeasance 
was born by taxpayers. While many Americans blamed 
the country’s fi nancial inequities on the president or Wall Street, 
others noted that globalization had undermined the ability of 
the United States to exert real control over its own economy.

threat to public health galvanized the gay community. Under 
Reagan, the federal government did very little to limit the

lobbying by AIDS activists, however, led to signifi cant federal 
involvement starting in 1992 and to important progress in 
combating AIDS.

CHANGES IN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY 
28.3 Explain cultural changes in the United States during the 1980s. 
Summary 
In the 1980s, popular culture took on a global dimension, with 
American music and musicians playing a dominant role in the 
new world culture. Technology played a central role in making 
this development possible. Technology also changed the way 
that people viewed movies and television. Th e religious right 
led the backlash against the cultural developments of the 1980s 
and 1990s. In the 1990s, Pat Robertson’s Christian Coalition 
rose to the forefront of the movement and became a powerful 
player in Republican politics. Th e late 20th century saw a surge 
in immigration, largely from Latin America and Asia. Debates 
about immigration, particularly illegal immigration, intensifi 
ed and gained new prominence in American politics. During 
the same decades, America’s original inhabitants struggled to 
maintain their distinct identity and heritage. Some American 
Indian tribes gained new prosperity as the result of the Indian

A New World Order 
On Inauguration Day, January 20, 1989, as Ronald Reagan left the 
White House, the nation was prosperous, his loyal vice president 
was replacing him, and perhaps even more significant, the long 
Cold War with the Soviet Union seemed to be coming to an end. George 
H.W. Bush would lead the nation in a very diff erent international context 
than any predecessor since World War II. In April 1989, just aft er Bush’s 
inauguration, the Communist government of Poland, with Gorbachev’s 
permission, legalized the prodemocracy Solidarity and agreed to free 
elections. In June, for the fi rst time in history, a Communist government 
was voted out of offi ce and yielded power peacefully to its non- Communist 
successor. That fall, Hungary followed the same course and ousted its 
Communist government. Demonstrations in East Germany led to a change 
in leadership, and on November 9, the Berlin Wall that had divided the city, 
and Europe, for almost 30 years came down. With the fall of the Berlin Wall, 
Berliners who had never met each other embraced and celebrated. Leaders 
of East and West Germany talked of unifi cation, which came 2 years later. 
In December, Czechoslovakia inaugurated a non-Communist government. 
What had begun as a conversation between two leaders in a house in Iceland 
in 1986 had become, by 1989, what the new president called “a new world order.” 
Th e end of the Cold War drastically changed U.S. foreign policy, and allowed

people to see the world diff erently. Tracing the changes in U.S. foreign policy and politics 
in the post-Cold War world as well as the domestic changes, especially those brought about 
by technology in the decade aft er the Cold War ended, is the focus of this chapter. 
THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION, 1989–1993 
Explain the New World Order that George Bush described. 
Few people came to the White House as well prepared to manage the rapid changes in the 
international situation as George H.W. Bush. As a former U.S. Ambassador to China, former 
head of the CIA, and former vice president, he knew the key players and understood 
the context of events as well as anyone. Unlike his predecessor, Bush came to offi ce with a 
prime interest in foreign policy. It was an expertise that might serve him well in the rapidly 
changing world of the 1990s. Th e United States was also changing, economically and technologically, 
but President Bush was less prepared to deal with some of the rapid domestic 
changes that were taking place, which in the end cost him a second term in offi ce. 
Foreign Policy Between 1989 and 1993 
Bush and his foreign policy team—Secretary of State James Baker, Secretary of Defense 
Richard Cheney, National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft (a retired Air Force general), 
and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chair General Colin Powell—were initially skeptical of 
the agreements by which Reagan and Gorbachev had sought to end the Cold War, and 
they did not propose to reduce defense spending. However, the pace of international 
developments only accelerated aft er Bush took offi ce. Bush maintained a hands-off policy 
toward the dissolution of Soviet control in Eastern Europe. He said that the United 
States did not want to “poke a stick in the eyes of Mr. Gorbachev.” But he insisted, in 
spite of pleas by Gorbachev and European leaders, that Germany had the right to be 
united and that the new nation should be part of NATO. Bush showed less inclination 
to state a position when Lithuania declared independence in March 1990, leaving it to 
the Lithuanians and the Soviets to work out the terms of their own agreement.

While Gorbachev and Bush got to know each other, Gorbachev’s own hold on 
power weakened. Hardliners within the Kremlin blamed Gorbachev for weak leadership 
as Soviet control of eastern Europe ended. In August 1991, old-line communists 
staged a military coup and arrested Gorbachev. Boris Yeltsin, the president of the Russian 
Republic, the largest and most powerful of the 15 Soviet Republics that made up the 
Soviet Union (or Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the U.S.S.R.), helped defeat the 
coup leaders, and Gorbachev was freed and restored to power within days. However, the 
restoration was short lived. In December 1991, Gorbachev announced that the Union 
of Soviet Socialist Republics (the Soviet Union), which had governed Russia and its 
neighbors since 1917, was no more. Russia, the Ukraine, and Belarus created an informal 
Confederation of Independent States. Other former Soviet Republics savored their 
independence. Gorbachev’s position simply disappeared. At the Kremlin, the red hammer 
and sickle fl ag was replaced with the blue fl ag of the Russian Republic. Th e prime 
enemy of the United States through 45 years of Cold War was gone. While relations with 
Russia and the other former Soviet republics would be diffi cult at times, they took place 
in a vastly diff erent world. (see Map 29-1).

While Eastern Europe went through its dramatic changes, the other Communist 
giant, China, was also changing. As a former ambassador to China, Bush thought he 
knew the country well and wanted to build closer ties. But he was taken by complete 
surprise in the spring of 1989, when Chinese students gathered in Tiananmen Square 
in the heart of China’s capital, Beijing, to protest the communist party’s tight hold and 
to demand more democratic governance and greater individual freedom. Such protests 
were unheard of in Communist China. By May, as protests had spread to 200 
other Chinese cities, the government declared martial law, and then in June sent tanks 
and army units into Tiananmen Square, killing perhaps 3,000 students and injuring 
three times as many. Th e communist government of China was not about to follow 
Russia’s peaceful transition to a diff erent social system. Th e world, including President 
Bush, was horrified. For the rest of his term, Bush was torn about whether to join 
other nations in protest, seek to maintain and expand commercial ties with China, and 
respond to protests by members of Congress and the 43,000 Chinese students who 
were in the United States. Th e result was an unclear and inconsistent China policy. 
In August 1990, the Bush foreign policy team was confronted by another surprising 
crisis in yet another part of the world. On August 1, Iraqi dictator Saddam 
Hussein ordered an attack on Iraq’s smaller neighbor, Kuwait, and quickly took control 
of the country. Kuwait had been part of Iraq until 1961, and Hussein insisted he 
was simply reuniting what should never have been divided. U.S. ambassador to Iraq, 
April Glaspie, had told Hussein that the United States had “no opinion,” on Iraq’s 
border dispute with Kuwait, but she never meant that statement to mean the United 
States would allow Iraq to swallow its neighbor. Both Iraq and Kuwait were among the 
world’s largest oil producers, and Iraqi control of Kuwait meant that an Iraqi dictator, 
whom the United States did not trust, was in control of 20 percent of the world’s oil.

29.1 
Bush announced, “This will not stand.” The United States negotiated with 
Hussein but quickly began military planning if negotiations failed. Bush gained the 
support of Syria, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia in insisting that Iraq must leave Kuwait. 
In November, the UN Security Council authorized the use of force if negotiations 
did not succeed. While there was signifi cant opposition in the United States to any 
intervention, Congress authorized the use of force, though in the Senate the vote 
was a close 52-47. 
On January 17, 1991, the U.S.-led Operation Desert Storm began. An air war 
showered missiles and bombs on the Iraqi forces in Kuwait and destroyed communications 
and electrical systems in Iraq. On February 24, U.S. Marines from bases in 
Saudi Arabia landed in Kuwait and in 100 hours of battle drove the Iraqi forces out of 
the country. Kuwait was reestablished as an independent country and a close U.S. ally. 
Fearing unnecessary carnage and not wanting a U.S. occupation of Iraq proper, Bush 
then halted all military operations. Th e war was over. It seemed an easy military victory, 
but it was not without costs. 
Within Iraq, rebellions broke out against Hussein’s rule. While Bush hoped they 
would succeed, he was not willing to intervene or to try to topple Hussein, fearing 
that the United States would be caught in a long-term land war in Iraq. He did, 
however, take action to protect the Kurdish minority in a new autonomous region 
within northern Iraq, announcing a “no fl y zone” in which the United States would 
shoot down any Iraqi planes over that area, but opposition forces in the rest of the 
country, expecting U.S. aid that never came, were slaughtered by Hussein’s troops. 
A U.S. boycott of Iraq led to widespread suff ering within the country. Finally, the 
staging of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia, site of the holiest places in the Muslim world, 
stirred anger among devout Muslims who hated the idea of non-Muslims in that 
region. Among those who were angry was Osama bin Laden, a Saudi who founded 
al-Qaeda, a terrorist organization, to retaliate against both Saudi Arabia and the 
United States. 
Meanwhile, closer to home, Bush decided in December 1989 that Panama’s dictator, 
Manuel Noriega, had to be removed. Noriega had received CIA support to oppose 
Communists in the region, but he had also gotten rich through drug traffi cking and 
had become a brutal dictator. When his party lost a presidential election in May 
1989, Noriega annulled the election. Knowing that the Carter-era treaty meant that 
the Panama Canal was going to be returned to Panama, Bush took no chances. On 
December 20, a U.S. assault team landed in Panama and took control of the country. 
Th ey restored the democratically elected president of Panama, Guillermo Endara, and 
eventually arrested Noriega as a drug dealer and imprisoned him in Florida. 
Th e Bush team also made other international eff orts that had mixed results. Th e 
administration negotiated a North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) that 
would eliminate tariff s between the United States and Canada and Mexico, but Senate 
confi rmation of the treaty was slow in coming. Into Somalia, a nation in northeast 
Africa threatened by famine and chaos, the United States sent 28,000 peacekeeping 
troops, but could not eff ect large-scale changes. To the surprise of many of its own 
citizens, Yugoslavia, which had been relatively stable since the end of World War 
II, disintegrated into ethnic hostility between its Eastern Orthodox Serbian, Roman 
Catholic Croatian, and Bosnian Muslim communities. In response to the new crisis 
in Yugoslavia, the United States supported a UN peacekeeping mission, which was 
ineff ective, and an arms embargo. Even with the Cold War over, the world remained a 
confusing and dangerous place. 
Education, Legislation, and the Supreme Court 
In his inaugural address, George Bush angered the outgoing Ronald Reagan by 
saying that it was time “to make kinder the face of the Nation and gentler the face 
of the world.” He also continued the Reagan assault on big government, insisting

that the new “kindness” must come from a “thousand points of light,” emerging 
from local nongovernmental groups around the country rather than from federal 
government programs. 
Bush called himself an “education president.” Where Reagan sought to abolish 
the Department of Education and reduce the federal government’s role in education, 
Bush convened the nation’s governors at an “Education Summit” in Charlottesville, 
Virginia, in the fall of 1989 to address the challenges in American public schools. 
Th e plan that emerged from Bush’s partnership with the governors, who were led by 
Arkansas governor Bill Clinton, was called America 2000. It sought to improve the 
nation’s schools by setting new national standards for all students. 
Bush also focused efforts on two other pieces of legislation that would have farreaching 
results. He supported the Clean Air Act that toughened air quality standards 
and pollution controls. It would effect huge changes in industry and begin to shift 
more attention to environmental issues. He also led the fi ght for the Americans with 
Disabilities Act (ADA) that passed Congress in 1990. Th e ADA outlawed discrimination 
in employment, public services, and public accommodations for people with disabilities. 
It not only transformed the face of American buildings that now had to provide 
wheelchair ramps, elevators, and appropriate lavatories for those with physical disabilities 
but also put in motion pervasive changes in hiring practices and services that would 
benefi t all those with disabilities, including those who were deaf and blind. 
Bush’s fi rst appointment to the Supreme Court, David Souter, drew little controversy. 
Souter turned out to be a more liberal judge than many expected, probably including 
Bush, especially when he voted to affi rm the court’s Roe v. Wade decision in 1992. 
When Th urgood Marshall retired, Bush stirred considerable controversy by nominating 
Clarence Th omas. Th omas, like Marshall, was an African-American, but while Marshall 
had been known as “Mr. Civil Rights” and was probably the most liberal member of the 
court in many years, Th omas was known as an unusually conservative Republican. In his 
confi rmation hearings, Th omas was accused of sexual harassment by 
Anita Hill, a black law professor and former member of Th omas’s staff . 
Hill off ered explicit testimony as to what Th omas had said and done, 
which was highly embarrassing to Thomas and his supporters. Hill 
was attacked in turn by conservatives, and Th omas called the assault 
a “high-tech lynching for uppity blacks,” but when he was confi rmed 
by the narrowest of Senate votes, 52 to 48, many women concluded 
that the male senators did not take sexual harassment seriously. While 
Th omas took his seat on the court, more women ran for and won elective 
offi ce the following year than in any previous time, increasing their 
numbers in the Senate, the House, and state legislatures. 
Race: From Rodney King to O.J. Simpson 
In March 1991, Rodney King, an African-American, failed to stop 
for police on the Foothill Freeway near San Fernando, California. Los 
Angeles Police Department (LAPD) offi cers gave chase for 8 miles 
and finally arrested King. When King resisted arrest, four police 
offi cers beat him as he lay on the ground. A nearby resident used a 
home video camera to record the arrest and beating, and the video 
was quickly distributed around the nation. People were outraged. 
Although King had resisted arrest, the offi cers had clearly continued 
to beat him long aft er he was subdued. 
The four officers on the video were arrested. Their attorneys 
argued that they could not get a fair trial in Los Angeles and the trial 
was moved to mostly rural Simi County, California. Th e result of the 
move was that the officers faced an all-white jury, unlikely in Los 
Angeles County. In April 1992, the jury found three of the offi cers

not guilty and deadlocked on the fourth. Th e acquittal released pent-up anger in the 
black community in Los Angeles. Riots lasting 4 days resulted in 53 deaths, 2,300 injuries, 
and $1 billion in property damage. Black and Latino rioters targeted whites and 
Asians in their neighborhoods, perhaps especially Korean storeowners. A video from 
the riot showed a white truck driver being pulled out of his cab and beaten. Only the 
intervention of other blacks who got the driver to a hospital saved his life. For many, 
the arrest of King, the trial, and the riot that followed illustrated just how deeply lines 
were still drawn between races in the United States in the 1990s. 
While the events around King got the headlines, scholars and activists debated the 
state of race relations. Some observed that despite what happened, much had changed 
since the 1950s when blacks were legally barred from white schools, white bus seats, 
and all-white polling places in many places. Orlando Patterson, a Harvard sociologist, 
wrote “Relations between ordinary Afro-Americans and Euro-Americans are, in 
fact, the best they have ever been, although still far from ideal.” Other scholars were 
less sure, noting that events like the beating of Rodney King and data about the educational 
experience of many black and Latino students confi rmed that much had not 
changed. Andrew Hacker wrote that “A huge racial chasm remains, and there are few 
signs that the coming century will see it closed.” 
In 1994, another crisis illustrated the depth of the racial divide in the United States. 
O.J. Simpson, a celebrated African-American Hall of Fame former football star, was 
arrested in June aft er his divorced wife, Nicole Brown, who was white, and her white 
friend, Ron Goldman, were found stabbed to death just outside her condominium 
in an exclusive neighborhood of Los Angeles. When the police issued a warrant for 
Simpson’s arrest, he and a friend fl ed in Simpson’s white Bronco down the Artesia 
Freeway while perhaps 100,000 Americans watched on TV. Simpson eventually surrendered, 
and his trial continued for most of the next year. The evidence against 
Simpson seemed strong, but black and white Americans saw it diff erently. In one poll, 
63 percent of whites thought he would get a fair trial while 69 percent of blacks thought 
he would not. Th e trial was a media circus. Simpson’s lead attorney, Johnnie Cochran, 
a tough African-American trial lawyer, proved that the investigation of Simpson by 
the Los Angeles police was fi lled with racist assumptions, although he did not prove 
Simpson’s innocence. When in October 1995 a jury acquitted Simpson of the murder 
charge, a majority of blacks agreed with the verdict, and celebrations broke out 
in black communities, while most whites were stunned. Regardless of whoever killed 
Brown and Goldman, the Simpson trial showed that Americans of diff erent races were 
deeply divided in how they viewed the criminal justice system in the 1990s. 
Economic Troubles and the Election of 1992 
Bush’s greatest political failure was his inability to manage the U.S. economy. Aft er 
1990, the economy went into a serious recession. During 1991 and 1992, AT&T fi red 
100,000 workers, GM fi red 74,000, and two major airlines, Pan Am and Eastern, went 
bankrupt, throwing more out of work. People blamed the president. With his preoccupation 
with foreign policy, Bush seemed out of touch, a perception that did not help 
his political standing. 
Bush’s economic problems became an even worse political liability when he 
decided, in the face of the rapidly increasing government debt, that he needed to raise 
taxes in spite of his promise not to do so. When the top tax bracket was increased 
from 28 to 31.5 percent, the New York Post headline said, “Read my lips: I Lied.” 
Conservative Republicans never forgave Bush. 
With the Republican Party in not-quite-open revolt and the nation’s economy 
in trouble, Democrats smelled victory in the 1992 election. Arkansas governor Bill 
Clinton soon emerged as a Democratic front-runner. When Clinton lost the New 
Hampshire primary, he called himself the “comeback kid,” and campaigned harder 
than ever. Clinton demonstrated a combination of strengths and of weaknesses.

He was brilliant. Even though he grew up in poverty, he excelled in school and won 
scholarships to Georgetown University, was awarded a Rhodes scholarship to Oxford, 
and then went on to Yale Law School. At Yale, he also met and married fellow student 
Hillary Rodham. He was as charismatic on the campaign trail as John F. Kennedy had 
been. As one of the founders of the Democratic Leadership Council, he was a moderate 
who distanced himself from his party’s more liberal members. Clinton also had his 
weaknesses. Th e explanations he gave for his rumored womanizing, draft dodging, and 
one-time marijuana smoking were never convincing and he earned the name “Slick 
Willie.” But he was a tough campaigner who would not quit. He won the Democratic 
nomination, asked Tennessee senator Al Gore, a fellow baby boomer, to be his running 
mate, and in spite of a personally chaotic style, kept his campaign focused. A sign 
in the Clinton campaign headquarters reading “It’s the economy, stupid.” said it all. 
An independent candidate also entered the race, eccentric billionaire H. Ross 
Perot. Perot described the defi cit as being “like a crazy aunt we keep down in the basement. 
All the neighbors know she’s there but nobody wants to talk about her.” He said 
that Bush’s NAFTA Treaty would produce a “giant sucking sound” of American jobs 
leaving the country. Although given virtually no chance of winning, Perot was the 
most popular third-party candidate in many years. 
Bush was challenged for the Republican nomination by conservative commentator 
Pat Buchanan, known as the “pit bull of the Right.” Bush easily defeated Buchanan for 
the nomination, but the attack weakened the president. Th e conservative dominance 
of the 1992 Republican convention, especially the vocal role of religious conservatives 
like Buchanan, alienated many more moderate voters. Th roughout the fall campaign, 
the president seemed disengaged. It was not a close contest. Clinton won almost 
45 million votes to Bush’s 39 million. Surprisingly, Perot won almost 20 million votes, 
hurting Bush more than Clinton. Democrats retained control of the Senate 57 to 
43 and the House 258 to 176.

29.1 
THE CLINTON PRESIDENCY 
Analyze the impact of the Clinton presidency and the Clinton–Gingrich conflict on the 
country. 
Clinton came to offi ce with high hopes. He idolized John F. Kennedy and wanted to be 
remembered as another Kennedy. Clinton, the fi rst baby boomer president, replaced 
Bush, the last of eight presidents who had served in World War II. He saw his coming 
to offi ce as a generational change and told the country, “Today, a generation raised in 
the shadows of the Cold War assumes new responsibilities.” He set an activist agenda, 
saying, “We must invest more in our own people, in their jobs, in their future, and at 
the same time cut our massive debt.” Clinton did cut the federal defi cit, dramatically. 
Success on other fronts, however, was more elusive. 
The Early Clinton Agenda: It’s Still—Mostly—the Economy 
Clinton knew he owed his election to the poor state of the nation’s economy. Clinton 
also knew that he would be reelected in 1996 only if the economic picture brightened. 
Having campaigned as a moderate Democrat, he surprised many when he made 
health care reform his fi rst major policy initiative. Clinton, however, was convinced 
that reforming the nation’s chaotic health insurance system would provide a signifi cant 
jolt to the economy and that providing insurance for the 35 million Americans who 
had no insurance would help close the growing gap between rich and poor. 
In spite of personal tensions in their marriage, Bill and Hillary Clinton were an 
especially close political team, sometimes compared to Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt. 
Th e president appointed his wife, along with trusted associate Ira Magaziner, to lead 
a task force to redesign the nation’s health care system. Unfortunately, the Clinton- 
Magaziner team made two signifi cant errors. First, their fi nal 1,342-page report was 
too long and far too complicated. Second, while they consulted hundreds of experts in 
developing the report, they failed to consult with Congress. In 1993, Clinton said, “If I 
don’t get health care, I’ll wish I didn’t run for President.” In the end, he did not get it. 
Conservatives in the Republican minority, led by Congressman Newt Gingrich from 
Georgia, attacked the plan from the day it was announced. Representatives of physicians 
and the insurance industry attacked the plan with TV ads and heavily fi nanced 
congressional lobbying. Without strong support from a large segment of the population 
or the Democratic majority in Congress, the plan was doomed. In August 1994, 
the president announced that he was dropping the plan. It had not yet reached a single 
vote in Congress, but the probable outcome had become clear. 
Other issues also got in the way of what Clinton wanted to accomplish. When 
Clinton tried to fire long-time staff members of the White House travel office for 
alleged improprieties, he was blocked and accused of trying to give those jobs to 
friends. When he tried to fulfi ll a campaign promise to end the ban on gay men and 
lesbians serving in the armed forces, he was blocked again. Th e resulting compromise 
of “Don’t ask, don’t tell,” in which offi cers would not ask about sexual orientation 
and soldiers and sailors would keep their sexual orientation hidden or face discharge, 
satisfi ed no one. 
Only weeks into the new presidency, Clinton’s administration had to handle the 
fallout from an unexpected confrontation in Texas. In Waco, Texas, cult members led 
by David Koresh had blockaded themselves in their group’s compound. A gun battle 
with agents of the FBI and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms on February 28 
led to a 7-week stand-off . When the FBI became convinced that children in the compound 
were being abused, they attacked. Koresh ordered the compound burned, and 
he and more than 80 of his followers, including 21 children, were killed. It was a horrible 
outcome that brought signifi cant criticism of the administration and especially 
of Janet Reno, the new attorney general who had approved the raid, though few knew 
what could have been a good outcome.

Clinton had more success on other fronts. Within 2 weeks of taking offi ce, he signed 
the Family and Medical Leave Act, which Bush had vetoed twice. Th e law guaranteed 
up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for family medical emergencies and pregnancy. In his 
campaign, he had promised to develop a national service plan, and Congress quickly 
approved Clinton’s AmeriCorps, which encouraged volunteerism and promised fi nancial 
support for college costs to those who gave a year of national service. In September 
1994, the fi rst 20,000 AmeriCorps volunteers were sworn in. Congress also authorized 
$2 billion for Goals 2000 , the Clinton version of President Bush’s America 2000 education 
plan to set national educational standards in core academic subjects. In addition, 
Congress approved a modest ban on semiautomatic assault weapons and a “Freedom of 
Access to Clinic Entrances Act” that required antiabortion protesters to keep some distance 
from medical clinics or places of worship. During his fi rst 2 years, the Senate confi 
rmed two of Clinton’s Supreme Court nominees, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen 
Breyer. With their confi rmation, the court’s conservative drift seemed to stop. 
In addition, Clinton was convinced that the huge defi cit, which had grown substantially 
under Reagan and Bush, was creating a drag on the American economy. He 
was also anxious to establish his political credentials as a moderate. In August 1993, 
less than 7 months into offi ce and with the health care bill still pending, Congress 
passed Clinton’s fi rst budget. Th e budget infuriated conservatives because it included 
a tax increase, and it infuriated liberals because it did little for federal programs. Th e 
administration’s goal was simple: balance the federal budget and lower the federal 
debt. Clinton succeeded, and during his term in offi ce, the total federal spending as a 
share of the U.S. gross domestic product dropped from 21.5 percent to 19.1 percent. 
Starting in 1998, real surpluses allowed a major reduction in the federal debt. 
Immediately after the Clinton’s budget passed Congress, he turned his attention 
to getting congressional approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement 
(NAFTA), which had been negotiated by George Bush. Few gave NAFTA much chance 
for approval. Labor unions hated the treaty because it proposed to reduce all trade barriers 
between the United States, Canada, and Mexico, and the unions feared it would 
cost jobs. Ross Perot had based his third-party campaign on opposition to NAFTA 
and had succeeded in winning 19 percent of the vote. Nevertheless, Clinton believed 
that free trade and the development of an unfettered global economy was the key to 
long-term prosperity. He allied with Republicans in Congress, and against some of his 
closest Democratic allies, to get the treaty passed, and he signed it in December 1993. 
Although Clinton saw himself as a moderate to conservative Democrat, conservative 
Republicans, especially those in the House of Representatives, did not think he was nearly 
conservative enough. Clinton also sought to undercut Republican eff orts to diff erentiate 
themselves from him, which Republicans found utterly frustrating. Under the leadership 
of a Georgia congressman, Newt Gingrich, working with congressmen Dick Armey and 
Tom DeLay of Texas, House Republicans planned for the 1994 midterm elections. Th e 
House of Representatives had enjoyed a Democratic majority and a Democratic Speaker 
for 60 of the 64 years between 1930 and 1994. While the Senate and the White House 
changed hands, the House seemed permanently Democratic. But a new generation of 
representatives, coming mostly from suburban districts, especially in the South, where 
there had been few Republicans elected until the 1970s, were determined to create a 
Republican majority in the Congress and enact their agenda. Th ey were very successful. 
In November 1994, 34 Democrats were defeated in their bids for reelection, a new 
Republican majority took control, and Gingrich became the Speaker of the House. 
“The Era of Big Government Is Over” 
With the new Republican majority and Newt Gingrich as the new speaker coming to 
power at the end of Clinton’ second year in offi ce, the chance for signifi cant legislative 
victories for Clinton virtually disappeared. Clinton would spend much of the next 
6 years either trying to hold on to past Democratic victories or doing what he and

coming decades to improve the quality of

Not all Americans supported the NAFTA trade

Contests for seats in the U.S. House of Representatives are traditionally 
local. In the 1994 campaign, however, 337 Republican 
candidates endorsed a common platform in a dramatic ceremony 
on the Capitol steps. Their “Contract with America” represented the 
voice of conservative Americans. 
As Republican Members of the House of Representatives 
and as citizens seeking to join that body we propose not just 
to change its policies, but even more important, to restore 
the bonds of trust between the people and their elected 
representatives. … 
Thereafter, within the first 100 days of the 104th Congress, 
we shall bring to the House Floor the following bills, each to be 
given full and open debate, each to be given a clear and fair vote 
and each to be immediately available this day for public inspection 
and scrutiny. 
1. THE FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY ACT: A balanced budget/ 
tax limitation amendment and a legislative line-item 
veto to restore fiscal responsibility to an out-of-control 
Congress, requiring them to live under the same budget 
constraints as families and businesses. 
2. THE TAKING BACK OUR STREETS ACT: An anticrime 
package including stronger truth-in-sentencing, “good 
faith” exclusionary rule exemptions, effective death penalty 
provisions, and cuts in social spending from this 
summer’s “crime” bill to fund prison construction and 
additional law enforcement to keep people secure in their 
neighborhoods and kids safe in their schools. 
3. THE PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY ACT: Discourage illegitimacy 
and teen pregnancy by prohibiting welfare to minor 
mothers and denying increased AFDC for additional children 
while on welfare, cut spending for welfare programs, 
and enact a tough 2-years-and-out provision with work 
requirements to promote individual responsibility. 
4. THE FAMILY REINFORCEMENT ACT: Child support 
enforcement, tax incentives for adoption, strengthening 
rights of parents in their children’s education, stronger 
child pornography laws, and an elderly dependent 
care tax credit to reinforce the central role of families in 
American society. 
5. THE AMERICAN DREAM RESTORATION ACT: A $500 per 
child tax credit, begin repeal of the marriage tax penalty, 
and creation of American Dream Savings Accounts to provide 
middle class tax relief. 
6. THE NATIONAL SECURITY RESTORATION ACT: No U.S. troops 
under U.N. command and restoration of the essential parts 
of our national security funding to strengthen our national 
defense and maintain our credibility around the world. 
7. THE SENIOR CITIZENS FAIRNESS ACT: Raise the Social 
Security earnings limit which currently forces seniors 
out of the work force, repeal the 1993 tax hikes on Social 
Security benefits and provide tax incentives for private 
long-term care insurance to let older Americans keep 
more of what they have earned over the years. 
8. THE JOB CREATION AND WAGE ENHANCEMENT ACT: 
Small business incentives, capital gains cut and indexation, 
neutral cost recovery, risk assessment/cost-benefit analysis, 
strengthening the Regulatory Flexibility Act and unfunded 
mandate reform to create jobs and raise worker wages. 
9. THE COMMON SENSE LEGAL REFORM ACT: “Loser 
pays” laws, reasonable limits on punitive damages, and 
reform of product liability laws to stem the endless tide of 
litigation. 
10. THE CITIZEN LEGISLATURE ACT: A first-ever vote on 
term limits to replace career politicians with citizen 
legislators.

his closest political advisor, Dick Morris, called “triangulating,” fi nding a third point 
between increasingly conservative Republicans and increasingly liberal Democrats to 
stake out their own position, one that sometimes undercut both. 
The biggest battle between the Clinton administration and the Gingrich 
Republicans came in late 1995, only months into the tenure of the new Congress. 
Aft er several months of budget battles, Congress passed a budget that included cuts 
in social programs. Clinton vetoed the budget with the result that the government 
was briefl y without a budget, forcing a partial government shut down for 6 days in 
29.3 
29.2 
29.1 

Chapter 29 A New World Order 903 
November. Aft er temporary legislation reopened government offi ces later that month, 
the Republican House passed a budget with even further cuts, reducing funds for 
food stamps, Medicare, and other domestic program. Republican leaders proudly 
announced, “Th is is a fundamental change in the direction of government.” Clinton 
again vetoed the budget, and on December 16, the government shut down for 21 days. 
Federal employees went without their paychecks; national parks and “nonessential” 
government offi ces closed. Only in January was a compromise reached that restored 
most of the cuts. Most political observers thought Clinton had won the battle, painting 
Gingrich as an extremist and Clinton as a cautious moderate. 
In the context of this tense budget debate, Clinton went to Congress in January 
1996 to give his annual State of the Union message. He announced, “Th e era of Big 
Government is over.” Many Democrats wondered who had really won the budget 
showdown. Clinton had already promised that one of his major policy goals for 
1996 was to “put an end to welfare as we know it.” Aft er vetoing more conservative 
legislation, in August 1996, Clinton signed the Personal Responsibility and Work 
Opportunity Reconciliation Act that replaced the federal government’s long-standing 
Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program with temporary assistance 
that prevented most people, except the disabled, from receiving more than 2 years 
of assistance, with a 5-year lifetime maximum. New York senator Daniel Moynihan 
called the result, which dropped 2 million black and Latino students from eligibility, 
the “most brutal act of social policy since Reconstruction.” Fortunately, the economy 
was experiencing a boom time when the law was passed; the minimum wage was 
raised, and there were jobs to be found, at least in the short run. Th e long-time cost to 
some of the nation’s poorest people was a diff erent matter. 
Clinton took other positions that disappointed liberals and heartened conservatives. 
He signed the Defense of Marriage Act , which said no state was required to 
recognize a same-sex marriage from another state. Since no state yet allowed same-sex 
marriage when the law passed, it was a symbolic move, but for gay and lesbian voters 
who had supported Clinton, it was a frustrating limitation that would have a greater 
impact in future years. 
In spite of the Republican gains in the 1994 elections, the 1996 presidential election 
was seldom in doubt. Th e Republicans nominated conservative Senator Robert 
Dole, a decorated World War II hero and a long-time Washington insider who preferred 
compromise to Gingrich-style confl ict. Dole had a good sense of humor but 
was not a strong campaigner. Clinton adopted many Republican issues and campaigned 
energetically. Clinton’s fundraising ability meant that the two parties were 
closely matched in available funds, where previously, Republicans had traditionally 
outspent Democrats by a two-to-one margin. Perot again ran as an outsider. Clinton 
won 49 percent of the vote to Dole’s 40 percent. Perot’s vote dropped to less than 
9 percent. Clinton coasted to a second term, but with Republican majorities in both 
houses of Congress. 
In the post–Cold War era, other trends were reshaping the American political 
scene. By the 1990s, the majority of Americans lived in suburbs, up from only a quarter 
of the population in the 1950s. Th e combination of suburbanization and the Voting 
Rights Act typically led to the nation’s urban centers electing liberal Democrats, oft en 
African-Americans or Latinos who reflected their districts majority, and the surrounding 
suburbs electing white conservatives who refl ected these districts. Especially 
in the South and West, Republican victories oft en came at the cost of moderates of 
either party, rather than liberal Democrats, with the result that, as the Republican 
Party got more conservative, the Democratic Party got more liberal. 
Since 1900, if not earlier, the Republican Party represented the elite, whether 
major corporate executives, Wall Street investors, or small town business leaders. Th e 
Democrats were the party of the working class, especially union members. Th e New 
Deal Coalition, which had kept Congress solidly Democratic for so long, included union 
members, urban immigrants (especially the Irish), and the white South. During the 
Defense of Marriage Act 
Legislation that required the federal 
government to ignore provisions of any 
state act recognizing same-sex marriages; 
was declared unconstitutional by the U.S.

the Civil War, shift ed to the Democratic Party. However, by the time Clinton came to 
offi ce, much had changed. Many white southerners had turned against the civil rights 
movement, which they associated with the Democrats, and had become Republicans. 
Many white workers in the North, especially those in ethnic enclaves, were making the 
same transition for the same reason. In addition, union membership had fallen to below 
10 percent of nongovernment workers, reducing the union vote. At the same time, more 
and more middle- and upper-middle-class professionals, including teachers, journalists, 
lawyers, and many in high-tech industries, supported the more liberal policies of the 
Democrats. In contrast to either 1930 or 1960, when if one knew a person’s income, 
one could make a good guess as to their political party preference, no such guess was 
possible in 1990. 
As the political divisions between the two parties grew sharper, the political discourse 
of the country grew more caustic. Angry talk radio shows drew huge audiences. 
Rush Limbaugh, who called women activists “feminazis” and environmentalists “environmental 
wackos,” drew an audience of 20 million. Th e National Rifl e Association 
stridently attacked any politician of either party who voted for any gun control. 
Common Cause sought to speak for a liberal perspective. Few spoke for moderation 
or even good manners. Respectful diff erences did not sell radio advertising. Likewise, 
respecting diff erences did not win political debates in Washington in the 1990s. 
Small Wars and Dangerous Terrorists—Clinton’s Foreign Policy 
Clinton once said, “Foreign policy is not what I came here to do.” Nevertheless, as 
president, he could not ignore the rest of the world. His proudest foreign policy 
accomplishment came early, with the passage of NAFTA, but it was far from his last 
foreign engagement. 
Early in his fi rst term, in September 1993, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin 
and Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) leader Yasser Arafat shook hands in the 
White House aft er signing the Oslo Accords , which Norway had helped to broker. Th e 
Oslo agreement led to a suspension of the intifada , the Palestinian uprising that had 
been going on since 1987. Th e PLO recognized Israel’s right to exist and renounced 
terrorism, while Israel agreed that the PLO would assume governing authority in parts 
of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. It was an optimistic moment for peace in the Middle 
East that ended all too soon when an outraged Israeli assassinated Rabin. 
In 1993, events in Somalia and Haiti demanded attention. Bush had initially sent 
troops to Somalia to help secure peace in that war-torn region of Africa, and Clinton 
authorized 440 elite troops. When American troops sought to capture a warlord who 
had ordered the killing of Pakistani UN troops, two U.S. Black Hawk helicopters were 
shot down in Mogadishu and 18 Americans were killed; the body of one was dragged 
through the streets of the city. Clinton immediately withdrew all Americans. In Haiti, 
when demonstrators blocked the landing of U.S. peacekeepers in Haiti, Clinton did 
not try to persist, in spite of his desire to support the democratically elected president 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 
In light of experiences in Somalia and Haiti, Clinton took an even more cautious 
stand in Rwanda when civil war broke out in April 1994. For 100 days, Hutus butchered 
perhaps 800,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutus who had tried to stop the genocide. 
Th e United States and the world did virtually nothing although perhaps 70 percent of 
the Tutsi population was killed. Aft er he left offi ce, Clinton said that his failure to act 
in Rwanda was his greatest regret, but there was little support for intervention in 1994. 
At the same time, the former Yugoslavia was continuing to come apart. Slobodan 
Milošević, the nationalist leader of Serbia, wanted to create a new “pure” Serbian 
nation. He led a slaughter in which perhaps 200,000 Bosnian Muslims were killed by 
Bosnian and Serbian nationalists. Some 6,000 UN peacekeepers were held as virtual 
prisoners while the slaughter went on (see Map 29-2).

While the United States and most of Europe did nothing, the battle continued. 
Finally in the summer of 1995, Clinton ordered the bombing of Serbian positions. 
When in July 1995 Serbia forced 40,000 Muslim refugees out of a UN safe area around 
Srebrenica, and then murdered some 7,000 Muslim men and boys, Clinton determined 
that further action was needed. In August, aft er further Serb attacks, the United 
States joined with other NATO forces in massive air strikes on Bosnian Serb positions. 
Th e bombing and NATO support for Croatian and Bosnian Muslim ground forces 
led Milošević to agree to join negotiations at the Wright-Patterson Air Force base in 
Dayton, Ohio. Th e Dayton Peace Accords led to a signifi cant reduction of the confl 
ict, the placement of 60,000 NATO soldiers in Bosnia, including 20,000 Americans, 
and the eventual war crimes trial of Milošević. In June 1999, the American commander 
in Europe, General Wesley Clark, convinced Clinton that the United States 
needed to intervene again to stop Serbian aggression in the province of Kosovo where 
Muslims made up 90 percent of the population. A bombing raid on the Serbian capital 
of Belgrade resulted in a bomb falling on the Chinese Embassy, which killed several 
staff members and deeply hurt U.S.–Chinese relations. 
Iraq also remained an issue, even though the war with Iraq over Kuwait was over 
before Clinton came to offi ce. Aft er the CIA concluded that Saddam Hussein had tried 
to arrange the assassination of former president Bush, Clinton ordered a missile strike 
on Baghdad that destroyed the country’s intelligence headquarters. Th e government 
also continued to monitor potential terrorist activity emanating from Iran or North 
Korea, both of which were seeking to develop nuclear weapons. 
In his eff orts at foreign relations, Clinton also tried to broker peace agreements. 
In 1995 he sought to recognize the government of Vietnam and supported a mission 
by three veterans of the Vietnam war then serving in the U.S. Senate, Democrats John 
Kerry of Massachusetts and Robert Kerrey of Nebraska and Republican John McCain

Vietnam and urged reconciliation. In addition, he worked for peace in Northern 
Ireland and in 1994 appointed former U.S. senator George Mitchell as special envoy. 
Mitchell helped broker the Good Friday Accords of 1998, a promising breakthrough 
in war-torn Ireland. 
Terrorism at Home and Abroad 
Terrorism, both domestic and foreign, posed unique challenges because terrorists were 
diffi cult to fi nd, to predict, and to deal with. While international terrorist acts deeply 
frightened the United States, a new form of domestic terrorism, though perhaps less 
organized, stunned the nation during Clinton’s term in offi ce. Th e actions of the FBI 
in the Waco, Texas, standoff with David Koresh had infuriated Timothy McVeigh and 
Terry Nichols, who believed that the FBI attack needed to be avenged. Th ey managed 
to build a powerful truck bomb, and on April 19, 1995, McVeigh drove the bomb to 
the parking lot of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City and detonated 
it. Th e resulting blast killed 168 people, including a number of children in a day 
care center. Th e bombing was the largest terrorist attack in U.S. history up to that time. 
McVeigh and Nichols were eventually captured, and McVeigh was executed, but government 
offi cials and the public knew that they were not the only Americans so disaffected 
that they might turn to violence. 
Four years later, two deeply disaff ected teenagers, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, 
whose journals refl ected their fascination with the Oklahoma City bombing, went on 
a rampage at their high school in Littleton, Colorado, a day aft er the anniversary of the 
earlier bombing. Th eir deadly rampage was the fi rst of what would be many similar 
school shootings, oft en in suburban or rural areas and oft en initiated by disturbed and 
angry males who sought revenge against teachers and more popular students and the 
fl eeting fame that came with such actions. 
In February 1993, only a month after Clinton took office, Muslim terrorists 
bombed the World Trade Center in New York City, killing six. Over 1,000 people 
were injured in the blast and 5,000 were evacuated from the buildings. Th e bombing

had been fueled by anger at the United States over its support for Israel and over the 
fact that U.S. troops had been stationed in Saudi Arabia near Muslim holy places. 
Some of the terrorists involved had gotten training from a relatively new terrorist 
group known as al-Qaeda. 
Th e leader of al-Qaeda was a rich Saudi, Osama bin Laden, who had been expelled 
from his home country for his terrorist leanings and then expelled from Africa, where 
he had been living. He landed in Afghanistan and supported the country’s Taliban 
government. In February 1998, when bin Laden called for a holy war against the 
On April 20, 1999, two high school students went on a 
shooting rampage at Columbine High School in Littleton, 
Colorado, killing 12 students and a teacher before committing 
suicide. The two had planned the day carefully and came 
to school well-armed with rifles and firebombs. Ever since that 
tragic day, and through the other school shootings that have followed 
in subsequent years, people have tried to make sense of 
what happened and why. One journalist, Neal Gabler, writing for 
the Los Angeles Times immediately after the event, asked readers 
to locate the tragedy in cultural and historical context: 
Of all the bizarre sidelights to the horrifying massacre at 
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., Tuesday, the most 
bizarre may have been the story of the students trapped inside 
the school who called local TV stations on their cell phones and 
provided brief commentaries on the action. According to one 
report, they signed off only because they feared the intruders 
might be watching television themselves and thus discover the 
whereabouts of the cell-phone users. All of which suggests that 
even for the perpetrators and their victims, television was the 
great mediator. 
By now, this is hardly surprising. Like so many real-life dramas 
in America, the Littleton tragedy became a media event 
even before the smoke had cleared and anyone knew what was 
really happening. Copters buzzed overhead, reporters swarmed 
the scene and commentators were soon delivering sententious 
analyses of what it all meant, giving us a sense of déjà vu. 
But tragedies like this are media events not only because 
the media immediately latch onto them. Often they are media 
events in two far more important senses: first because the perpetrators 
usually seem to have modeled their behavior after 
certain figures in the popular culture; and, second, because the 
rampages seem ultimately to have been staged for the media on 
the assumption that if you kill it, they will come. Or, put another 
way, what we witnessed at Littleton was not just inchoate rage. 
It was a premeditated performance in which the two gunmen 
roamed the school dispatching victims, whooping with delight 
after each murder. Without pop culture, the slaughter would 
have been unimaginable. 
Begin with the killers. In the inevitable postmortems that 
follow these horrors, it was reported that the outcasts Dylan 
Klebold and Eric Harris were part of a high school clique whose 
members wore long black trench coats and which dubbed itself 
the Trench Coat Mafia, a cinematic image if ever there was one. 
They were also devotees of the computer games “Doom” and 
“Quake,” in which players prowl virtual hallways shooting virtual 
victims with virtual guns. They worshipped Adolf Hitler, loved 
Goth music, and had a special fondness for Marilyn Manson, the 
mordant rockstar whose satanic persona is designed to scandalize 
parents of his fans. In short, Harris and Klebold were creatures 
of pop culture. 
Given how much these two seemed to have been shaped by 
movies, music, and computer games, it is tempting to blame the 
media once again for providing guidance to young would-be 
sociopaths.… 
What helped give these fantasies body is yet another new 
instrument of the entertainment age: the Internet. Movies provided 
a personal reverie for those disaffected teenagers of the 
past.…With the Internet to connect them, teenagers are no longer 
silent sufferers.…When you live within a virtual reality, you 
have to expect some addled individuals won’t accept the difference 
between the movie or video screen and the screen of life.

west, the CIA estimated that he had some 15,000 followers, though little was known 
about the hard-to-fi nd organization. In August 1998, al-Qaeda operatives managed 
to bomb the U.S. embassies in both Kenya and Tanzania. Most of the 223 killed and 
4,500 wounded were African civilians working in or around the embassies, though 
12 Americans were also killed. In October 2000, another al-Qaeda bomb ripped a hole 
in the hull of the Navy’s USS Cole while it was anchored in a port in Yemen. Seventeen 
sailors were killed. In all, some 90 Americans were killed by foreign terrorists, mostly 
bin Laden’s al-Qaeda, during the Clinton years. Far worse was to come in 2001, but 
the warning signs were there. 
Scandal and Impeachment 
On January 21, 1998, the Washington Post carried a story that surprised, but probably 
did not shock, the nation. Th e president of the United States had been involved in an 
aff air with a young White House intern and had lied about it to his wife, to his administration, 
to the press, and under oath. It made for a sensational news story, and in the 
months that followed, the young intern, Monica Lewinsky, and the sexual escapades of 
Bill Clinton, remained front-page news. 
Kenneth Starr, a zealous lawyer and former Republican solicitor general, was 
appointed as an independent prosecutor in 1994 to look into accusations that the president 
and Hillary Clinton’s land dealings in a development at the Whitewater River in 
Arkansas had been improper. He spent the next 4 years, and a signifi cant amount 
of taxpayer money, investigating but never discovered evidence of a crime. However, 
before being appointed, Starr was an advisor to the legal team assembled for a sexual 
harassment suit brought against Bill Clinton by Paula Corbin Jones, an Arkansas 
state employee who claimed that, while Clinton was governor, he had ordered a state 
trooper to bring her to his hotel room and sought sexual favors. Because of the trooper’s 
role, the aff air came to be known a “troopergate” in the media. 
By late 1997, both the Paula Jones lawsuit and the Whitewater investigation were 
crawling through the legal process with no end in sight and only limited political damage 
to the president. Th en the situation changed rapidly. A disgruntled former White 
House staff er, Linda Tripp, befriended Monica Lewinsky and secretly recorded their 
conversations as Lewinsky shared intimate details of her relationship with the president. 
As Lewinsky described it, she began her aff air with Clinton during the government 
shutdown of November 1995. Tripp then shared the tapes with legal counsel for 
Paula Jones, who used the evidence to bolster her case that Clinton regularly engaged 
in extramarital aff airs. She also shared the tapes with Starr. For Starr, the tapes proved 
that the president had lied under oath and perhaps also urged Lewinsky to lie, both 
federal crimes that could lead to impeachment. 
Clinton denied the whole story. At a press conference a few days after the 
Washington Post story broke, he said, “I want to say one thing to the American people. 
I want you to listen to me. I’m going to say this again. I did not have sexual relations 
with that woman, Ms. Lewinsky. I never told anybody to lie, not a single time, never. 
Th ese allegations are false. And I need to go back to work for the American people.” 
Hillary Clinton denounced Starr as being part of a “vast right-wing conspiracy,” and 
said—accurately—that he “has literally spent four years looking at every telephone call 
we’ve made, every check we’ve ever written, scratching for dirt.” 
In the summer of 1998, Lewinsky told a federal grand jury about her aff air with the 
president and produced a semen-stained dress that she had saved. Backed into a corner, 
on August 17, Clinton told a federal grand jury that he had engaged in an “inappropriate” 
relationship with Lewinsky. Th at evening, he gave a TV speech in which 
he said, “I did have a relationship with Ms. Lewinsky that was not appropriate.…It 
constituted a critical lapse in judgment and a personal failure.” And he admitted he 
had “misled people, including even my wife.” But he also insisted that the Starr investigation 
had “gone on too long, cost too much, and hurt too many innocent people.”

Chapter 29 A New World Order 909 
Many, even among Clinton’s closest supporters, were furious, if not at the aff air, 
then at the lying. At a time when the country needed to deal with its economy and 
the terrorist attacks in Kenya and Tanzania, the president was distracted and untrustworthy. 
Starr and the Republican majority in Congress were eager to punish the president. 
Starr sent his report to the House of Representatives. In December, the House, 
with its Republican majority, voted to impeach President Clinton on the grounds that 
he had committed perjury in his original testimony to a federal grand jury and had 
sought to obstruct justice in the Paula Jones case. It was only the second time in U.S. 
history that a president had been impeached. (Nixon resigned before an impeachment 
vote.) According to the Constitution, removing the president is a two-part process. 
The House must vote impeachment—essentially the same as a grand jury indictment—
then the House acts a prosecutor while the Senate acts as the jury, with the 
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court presiding. In Clinton’s case, the Senate was convinced 
that although his behavior was inappropriate, it hardly met the level of “high 
crimes and misdemeanors” specifi ed in the Constitution. On February 12, 1999, the 
Senate rejected the charges against Clinton by a vote of 55 to 45 for the perjury charge 
and 50 to 50 for the obstruction of justice charge, a very safe margin since a two-thirds 
vote was required to convict. Five to 10 Republicans joined all of the Democrats in 
voting not guilty on the two charges. Clinton could focus again on being president. 
Th e Starr investigation cost $60 million. 
Speaker Gingrich had been among the president’s harshest critics, but the 
impeachment did not turn out well for Gingrich. Just before the impeachment vote, 
Republicans lost fi ve seats in the November midterm congressional elections. It was 
the fi rst time since 1934 that the party holding the White House showed gains in midterm 
elections. But the speaker, who had been an avid prosecutor of the president, 
was further hurt by the revelation that he, too, had been having an extramarital aff air 
with a young staff aide. He resigned as speaker and announced that he would leave the 
House. Th e newly elected Republican Speaker, Robert Livingston of Louisiana, turned 
out to also be having an aff air and he, too, resigned. 
While many in the media were fascinated by the whole case, the American public 
was surprisingly indiff erent. Even if many did not approve of an extramarital aff air, 
it did not seem as big an issue as it might once have been. Clinton was hardly the 
fi rst president to stray from his marriage vows. Perhaps more important, the nation 
was prosperous and at peace in 1999. Clinton seemed to be doing his job, whatever 
his personal life. As the case wound down, Starr’s approval rating was 19 percent. 
Clinton’s seldom dropped below 55 percent in his second term. 
The Prosperous 1990s 
Although an economic downturn brought Clinton to offi ce, an economic upsurge kept 
him there. Aft er Clinton’s second year in offi ce, the U.S. economy started to grow, and it 
did not stop growing for the next 6 years. Nearly all Americans were better off at the end 
of Clinton’s term than they had been at the beginning. Th e signs of the new prosperity 
were everywhere. Of the nation’s 107 million households, 106 million had a color TV by 
2000, 96 million had a VCR or DVD player, 92 million a microwave, and 81 million had 
air-conditioning. Houses were larger than ever before. Americans were eating better as 
fresh, local, and seasonal foods became more widely available and more popular. 
The prosperity of the 1990s was the result of many factors. Clinton’s budget, 
which brought down the federal defi cit and produced the fi rst federal budget surpluses 
in decades, made more money available for investment and spending and 
kept interest rates low, all factors in the prosperity. Experts argued about whether 
Clinton’ free-trade policies, like NAFTA, were helping or hurting the economy, but 
certainly more goods were in circulation as a result. Changes in agriculture made 
farms and farmers more productive so fewer people, working less land, could produce 
more food—and more variety of foods—than ever before—enough to feed the

United States and much of the rest of the world. Th e boom in technology was producing 
many new products and cutting the costs of items such as TVs and computers 
that were already on the market. In addition, easily available personal credit, at low 
interest rates fed the consumer spending and consumer confi dence, even though it 
allowed people to pile up worrisome levels of debt. In his last State of the Union message 
in January 2000, Clinton was able to say, “Never before, has our nation enjoyed, 
at once, so much prosperity and social progress with so little internal crisis and so few 
external threats.” No wonder the president remained popular and the people of the 
United States relatively happy. 
Bush v. Gore —The Election and the Court Case of 2000 
Th e Constitution prevented Clinton from running for a third term in 2000. Even so, 
he still had a remarkably high approval rating despite the aff air with Monica Lewinsky 
that had tarnished his reputation. Th e logical candidate for the Democratic nomination 
was Vice President Al Gore. During the 8 years that Gore served as vice president, he 
established a solid reputation with special expertise in government operations, the use 
of the Internet, and the environment. Gore’s 1992 book, Earth in the Balance, described 
“humankind’s assault on the earth.” Although Gore had worked with Clinton for 8 years, 
he and the president were never especially close, and Gore had been deeply off ended by 
the Monica Lewinsky aff air. He selected Connecticut senator Joseph Lieberman as his 
running mate, the fi rst Jew to be on a major party’s national ticket. Lieberman had also 
been off ended by the president’s behavior and said so on the Senate fl oor. 
Th e two leading candidates for the Republican nomination were George W. Bush, 
the governor of Texas and the son of the former president, and Arizona senator John 
McCain. McCain was considered more liberal compared with Bush who called himself 
a “compassionate conservative.” By March, Bush had wrapped up the nomination. 
Bush asked former Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney to handle the vice presidential 
selection and, in the end, Cheney himself became the nominee. 
Gore made a fateful decision to distance himself from Clinton and did not call on 
the president to do much campaigning. He campaigned in favor of tough gun control 
legislation and for women’s right to choose on abortion decisions, and he promised to 
keep the Social Security trust fund in a “lock box” separate from the rest of the federal 
budget. Many, even among his supporters, found him to be stiff and “wooden,” hardly 
the relaxed and at-ease campaigner that Bill Clinton had been. 
Bush promised a major tax cut, giving the current budget surplus back to the people. 
He favored allowing people to invest some of their Social Security contributions 
in their own stock market accounts. He promised to reform public education. He told 
the country that he was “a uniter, not a divider,” and would work with Democrats 
and end the divisive partisanship in Washington. In a not-so-subtle reference to the 
Lewinsky aff air, he promised to restore “honor and dignity” to the presidency. He 
talked openly about how he had overcome his own alcoholism and about his bornagain 
Christian faith. He was a surprisingly strong campaigner in spite of his tendency 
to mangle the English language with statements like, “families is where our nation 
fi nds hope, where wings take dreams.” 
Two other candidates also entered the race: Ralph Nader, running on the Green 
Party ticket and critiquing the power that multinational corporations had over both 
Republicans and Democrats, and Patrick Buchanan, running a conservative and antiimmigrant 
campaign on Ross Perot’s Reform Party ticket. Although Nader and Buchanan 
might take crucial votes away from either candidate, no one gave them a chance of winning. 
In addition, several other candidates representing fringe parties entered the contest; 
however, they posed little threat even to siphon away votes from the major contenders. 
As the polls closed on November 7, 2000, results for several states were still up in 
the air, but later that night, the deciding vote seemed to come down to Florida. Gore 
had clearly won a small majority in the overall vote—a fi nal count of 50,992,335 for 
29.3 
29.2 
29.1 

Chapter 29 A New World Order 911 
Gore versus 50,455,156 for Bush (see Map 29-3). However, 
American presidential contests are decided by electoral votes, 
and at this point in the contest, whoever won Florida’s electoral 
vote would win the presidency. At one point, the major TV networks, 
using exit polls, announced that Gore had carried Florida. 
Later in the evening, they backed off . At around 2:00 a.m. they 
announced that Bush had won. Gore called Bush to congratulate 
him and was about to make a public concession speech. Th en as 
new data came in, he called Bush a second time to say that any 
announcement was premature. By midmorning on Wednesday, 
November 8, everyone agreed that the election was too close to 
call. It would stay that way for the next 36 days. 
Both campaigns assembled teams of attorneys to challenge 
votes and demand a Florida recount. Problems with Florida’s 
election procedures became apparent. Some African-American 
voters had been intimidated or turned away from the polls. In 
other places where votes were counted by punch cards fed into voting 
machines, cards with “hanging chads,” that is, cards that were 
not punched all the way through, were not counted, and in these 
places, the Gore team demanded a hand count. When Gore asked 
for a recount in four counties where the errors seemed especially 
glaring, the Bush lawyers challenged him in court. Aft er the Florida 
Supreme Court sided with Gore, the Bush team took the case to the 
U.S. Supreme Court. On December 12, the Supreme Court ruled 
in a 5 to 4 decision that a recount in only four counties violated the equal protection of 
the law and that, given the time that had elapsed, all recounts in Florida must cease. Th e 
next day Gore conceded the election though he said he disagreed with the court’s decision 
“with every fi ber of my being.” All fi ve of the justices who voted to end the recount 
had been appointed by Reagan and Herbert Walker Bush (oft en referred to as “Bush, Sr.” 
to distinguish him from George W. Bush). Th e other four justices were scathing in their 
dissent. Th e court’s senior justice John Paul Stevens, who had been appointed by Gerald 
Ford, said, “Although we may never know with complete certainty the identity of the 
winner of this year’s Presidential election, the identity of the loser is perfectly clear. It is 
the Nation’s confi dence in the judge as an impartial guardian of the rule of law.”

TECHNOLOGY DOMINATES AN ERA 
Analyze the changes in technology and their impact on U.S. culture. 
While Americans battled over elections and a host of social issues, a small group of 
Americans were transforming the world in a very diff erent way. In the 1990s, computer 
use and technological innovation—from connections to the Internet to the use 
of cell phones—became widespread in the United States. 
The Birth of New Technologies 
During World War II, the military sought ways to speed the mathematical calculations 
to send a shell in exactly the right direction to hit an enemy target. Th ese fi rst computers 
were exactly what the name implied: machines that computed distance, velocity, 
and air pressure, to get a shot where it was intended to go. Aft er the war, the U.S. Army’s 
1946 ENIAC computer, known as the “giant brain,” performed ballistic calculations in

30 minutes that had taken 12 hours for humans to perform. With its 17,468 vacuum 
tubes, it was also the largest electronic apparatus on the planet. Th roughout the 1950s 
and 1960s, similar large mainframe computers became common throughout American 
military bases, universities, and industry. 
A whole series of postwar inventions made possible the move from large mainframe 
computers to personal computers. In 1947, the Bell Labs invented transistors 
that could replace bulky and unreliable vacuum tubes. In 1958, Jack Kilby at 
Texas Instruments found a way to construct a transistor and the circuitry needed to 
launch the pocket calculator. In 1968, Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore founded 
Intel to market a microprocessor that was key to personal computers. Th e computer 
giants of the day—Burroughs, Univac, NCR Corporation, Control Data 
Corporation, and Honeywell—dismissed Intel. Within a decade, Intel would outpace 
all of them. 
In January 1975, the fi rst personal computer, the MITS Altair 8800, went on the 
market. Th e MITS company promised investors it would sell at least two hundred 
Altair computers. It quickly sold several thousand. Th e Altair had its problems. MITS 
shipped the computer as a kit, and the buyer needed to assemble it. One early purchaser, 
Steve Dompier of Berkeley, California, reported enthusiastically that his Altair 
had arrived “in the mail at 10 a.m. and 30 hours later it was up and running with only 
one bug in the memory.” Not everyone, however, had 30 hours to dedicate to making 
the new computer work. Th ose who did manage to successfully assemble their computers 
quickly realized the Altair’s second problem: it didn’t actually do much on its 
own. With no keyboard, no screen, and no disk drive, the Altair consisted of a case, a 
series of switches, and lights. It could do some things—solve mathematical problems 
as well as keep and sort lists. Dompier even found a way to link it to a radio and turn 
data into music. Th is early computer was a machine for dedicated enthusiasts, not the 
general public, but dedicated enthusiasts liked it. 
One especially enthusiastic group in the San Francisco Bay area called themselves 
the Homebrew Club. Th e Homebrew Club, self-described geeks, loved the new Altair. 
Most were hobbyists who just wanted to have fun with the machines. But they also 
had a political agenda. Th ey were rebels against the large government, universities, and 
corporations that dominated society and used technology, especially the giant mainframe 
computers, to do so. Homebrew wanted something diff erent—a modern world 
in which the individual with a personal computer was more powerful than the corporation 
or the military or the university with its giant computers. Ted Nelson, another Bay 
Area geek, wrote in his 1974 self-published Computer Lib/Dream Machines , “I would

possibilities than ever before imagined.

like to alert the reader, in no uncertain terms, that the time has come 
to be openly attentive and critical in observing and dealing with computer 
systems; and to transform criticism into action.…THE PUBLIC 
DOES NOT HAVE TO TAKE WHAT’S BEING DISHED OUT.” A 
decade earlier, students had demonstrated in Berkeley with signs that 
said (mocking the instructions on cards then used in mainframe computers), 
“Human Being: Do not bend, spindle, or mutilate.” According 
to Nelson, it was time to “liberate” the computer and put its power into 
everyone’s hands. 
Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs were part of Homebrew. Th ey decided 
that they should market their own kit that could outperform the Altair. 
Th ey sold their fi rst Apple I computer in 1976. However, to accomplish 
all they wanted—to make the computer truly a popular device that 
everyone could use—they needed something simpler and easier than the 
Altair or the Apple I. Jobs studied the styling of popular European toasters 
and mixers in the kitchen department at Macy’s in San Francisco 
and designed the plastic case for what became the Apple II. Th e two also 
designed new uses for the Apple. Th e Apple II could be connected to a 
TV or a stand-alone screen and used to play computer games. It could 
be used for spreadsheets and word processing. Small businesses could 
do their own fi nancial analysis. 
Jobs and Wozniak also courted investors, including two Silicon 
Valley engineers, Mike Markkula and Michael Scott, who formed 
the core of the new Apple Company that launched the Apple II computer in 1977. 
Apple was a huge success. Apple Computer’s revenue went from $800,000 in 1977 to 
$48,000,000 in 1979. Th at unbelievable start was only the beginning. 
IBM, the largest of the computer companies, realized the money to be made in 
personal computers and was determined that “Big Blue,” as IBM was known, not be 
left behind. In the 1970s, IBM’s money and power came from its manufacture of offi ce 
machines (the name International Business Machines actually meant something), 
including popular typewriters, and from leasing the large mainframe computers used 
by corporations and government agencies. 
In the summer of 1980, IBM created a special task force independent of all the 
normal routines of the company to create a personal computer (PC), complete with 
operating system, that could compete head-to-head with Apple, and do so quickly. 
Th e task force did its work in 12 months, and the fi rst IBM PC went on the market in 
August 1981. It was a huge hit. IBM made $43 million from its PC division in the fi rst 
year, and the profi ts were soon in the billions. 
Th e core of the IBM PC was Intel’s microprocessor, a power supply from Zenith, 
and printers from Epson. Even though IBM was one of the largest soft ware companies 
in the world, the team also decided to find a different source for the software 
for the PC. Th ey turned to a Seattle-based upstart known as Micro-soft (later simply 
Microsoft ), led by computer enthusiasts Bill Gates and Paul Allen. 
Gates and Allen had written a class-scheduling program for their own high school 
while students there. In 1975, Gates, like the people at Homebrew, became fascinated 
with the Altair. He dropped out of Harvard and moved to Albuquerque, New 
Mexico, where the Altair was manufactured. He and Allen began writing soft ware for 
the Altair and founded their company, Micro-soft , in April 1975. While Homebrew 
wanted to share all information freely, making personal computers part of a “people’s 
revolution,” Gates saw the potential for profi t. He wrote a 1976 open letter condemning 
information sharing as “theft .” Soft ware, Gates insisted, should be as closely held 
as any computer hardware. When the IBM team approached him, Gates assured them 
he could produce what they needed. He bought another operating system, the “Quick 
and Dirty Operating System,” (QDOS), adapted it to the needs of the IBM PC, and 
renamed it the MS-DOS (or Microsoft Disk Operating System). Rather than sell the

computing capabalities for both personal and business use.

system to IBM, Gates licensed the MS-DOS system and received royalties on every 
IBM PC sold. Th e foundation was laid by 1980 to make Bill Gates the richest person 
on the planet within a decade. 
By 1979, even before IBM set its team to work, Steve Jobs was looking for ways to 
improve the Apple II. He visited the research offi ces of the Xerox Corporation, Xerox 
PARC, which was something of a mecca to computer developers. Th e staff was intrigued 
but wary of the upstart Jobs. At Xerox, Jobs saw an engineer, Larry Tesler, working with 
a small box that he used to move a cursor around on a computer screen. Tesler called it 
a “mouse,” and with it, he could click on icons, open and close “ windows” on the screen, 
and give the machine commands. The mouse was slow and bulky. The engineers at 
Xerox were not quite sure what to do with it. Soon, Xerox withdrew from the personal 
computer business—though it made a fortune selling printers that linked to PCs made 
by others. But Jobs felt like he had seen the future. He set a team to work designing a 
very diff erent and more user-friendly mouse, and the Macintosh computer that went 
on sale in 1981 transformed the industry with its easy-to-operate system guided by a 
handheld mouse that replaced the need to key in commands. 
The Y2K Scare of January 1, 2000 
As the nation prepared for the calendar change from 1999 to January 1, 2000, people 
were strangely preoccupied with their computers. Reporting on the ABC News , Forrest 
Sawyer said: 
Surf through the Internet these days and you keep coming across a strange 
word, TEOTWAWKI. It stands for “the end of the world as we know it,” and 
it refers to the eff ect of a tiny, seemingly innocuous computer glitch, a tiny 
glitch a lot of people say could literally blow the lights out on civilization. 
Th e fear of what was sometimes called the “Y2K problem” or the “Millennium bug” 
was very real and illustrated how completely the United States had become dependent 
on computers by 2000. 
Th e Y2K problem was relatively simple. Beginning in the 1970s, computer programmers 
began using a two-digit code for the date. Rather than take up additional 
memory for 1978, they shortened the space for the year to two digits. Everyone—and 
every machine—knew that “78” meant 1978. But as 2000 got closer, some computer 
researchers began to get very nervous. If on New Year’s Day 2000 the computers suddenly 
thought it was 1900, who knew what might happen in term of systems malfunctioning 
or shutting down. 
Th e threat was very real. Th e U.S. Department of Defense worried about crucial 
information systems shutting down. Banks worried that all information on their 
accounts could be lost. Electric companies worried that the electric grid, now completely 
computer controlled and monitored, could shut down. Hospitals worried that 
everything from heart monitors and breathing machines to the electricity and air conditioning 
in the operating rooms could stop. Internet-based businesses might not be 
able to operate. Ultimately, very little went wrong. Monitoring equipment in nuclear 
power plants in Japan failed but was repaired within a few hours. Bus ticket validation 
machines in Australia failed. In several countries, some cell phones stopped taking 
messages. In the United States, slot machines in Delaware stopped and the Naval 
Observatory clock briefl y said that it was January 1, 19100. Th e problems, however, 
hardly resulted in the end of the world. 
Some insisted that the whole Y2K crisis had been a distraction. Others knew how 
much work it had taken to avoid a crisis. Paul Saff o, director of the Institute for the 
Future in Menlo Park, California, said, “Th is was not hype. Th is was not soft ware consultants 
trying to create a full employment act for themselves. Th is really could have 
screwed up our lives, and you know, a whole bunch of little geeks saved us.” David Eddy, 
a computer programmer in Boston who fi rst coined the term “Y2K crisis,” said, “Th e 
reason nothing bad happened was that so many people put so much work into it.”

Chapter 29 A New World Order 915 
As more people realized the seriousness of what could happen 
on January 1, 2000, if the nation’s increasingly networked 
computers all responded as if the date were January 1, 1900, 
many people began to worry. Many publications raised the alarm 
and in the end the problem was addressed though what some in 
retrospect saw as a hype others believed was a true crisis averted 
by the hard work of many experts. In any case, books like this one 
were very popular in the late 1990s and spoke to the increasing 
public dependence on computers in many aspects of people’s lives, 
something that had not been true even a few years earlier. 
Introduction: Houston, We Have a Problem 
It’s New Year’s Day 2000 and you’re headed to your best friend’s 
house to watch football. You’re in a hurry because you don’t want 
to miss kickoff, and you have to stop at the nearest cash machine 
first, because you promised to bring the beer. But instead of cash, 
the ATM commandeers your card, rudely informing you that it 
has expired. 
Furious, but knowing you won’t get much help on a holiday, you 
head to the nearest 7-11 intending to pay for your refreshments 
with a credit card. Pulling up to the store, you think a lot of people 
have the same idea, because there’s a long line at the checkout 
counter. But the problem is not a run on beer; instead, you find 
out, the cash register is not working. The word, as it reaches you 
at the end of the line, is that the cash register is computer-based 
and requires a valid date to start up. And for some reason, it won’t. 
“Some reason” is the Year 2000 problem, Y2K for short. 
The preceding hypothetical—but probable—scenario is 
just the tip of the iceberg, and if collective public denial continues, 
it is an iceberg that will sink titanic computer systems 
worldwide. Like the unheeded warnings of disaster on the 
oceanliner Titanic, the alert to the Year 2000 problem has 
been sounded—on television, in newspapers, magazines, and 
newsletters, and via the Internet. Often, however, it has been 
defined simply as the inability of computers to calculate properly 
with 00—two zeros—signifying the new century. Further, 
media coverage frequently couches the issue in computer 
jargon, making it seem irrelevant to anyone other than programmers 
and information systems managers. The truth is, 
the Year 2000 problem will affect each of us, personally and 
professionally.

Countdown Y2K: Business Survival Planning for the Year 2000 , 1999 
A lot of money was spent on Y2K preparation, perhaps $100 billion in the United 
States and $300 billion worldwide. Old computers and operating systems were 
replaced. Whatever the other results, the preparation for Y2K illustrated that, beyond 
a doubt, by 1999 the United States and the world had become deeply dependent on 
computers, the Internet, the World Wide Web, and related technology, most of which 
had not even existed 29 or 30 years earlier. 
A Connected Nation 
By the 1990s, the personal computers that were being produced by Apple and IBM 
as well as the systems such as those made by Microsoft that made them useful, were 
providing people with the ability to read, write, calculate, and do much more at speeds 
never before thought possible. Nevertheless, for the most part, these amazing machines 
each still stood alone. As early as the 1940s, dreamers like Vannevar Bush, founder of 
the National Science Foundation, were imagining a day when, through connected systems, 
“Th e patent attorney has on call the millions of issued patents.…Th e physician, 
puzzled by a patient’s reactions…runs rapidly through analogous case histories.…” 
But Bush’s dream remained just a dream for almost 50 years. Only in the 1990s did it 
become possible for most people to make meaningful connections between individual

computers—to share information, seek information, and combine information in 
heretofore unimaginable ways. Th ose connections were made possible by the development 
of the Internet , a massive network of smaller networks joined together. Actually, 
many separate developments created the Internet. 
President Kennedy and his Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara were preoccupied 
with the question of how the president could maintain communication 
with the nation’s far-flung military installations if a nuclear war actually happened. 
Without communication, the threat of massive retaliation in the case of a 
nuclear attack was a fi ction. In the 1960s, however, government planners knew that 
a nuclear blast would cripple existing radio communications and knock out the 
nation’s highly centralized telephone network. To solve the problem, the Pentagon 
turned to researchers at the RAND Corporation, and a RAND employee, Paul 
Baran, led the team that would solve the problem. A decade later, on August 27, 
1976, in the parking lot of Zott’s Beer Garden near Stanford University, a team of 
Stanford researchers sent a message from a computer in a van to another computer 
they had placed inside the bar. Th e message was received, and the fi rst data transmission 
had taken place over a network. Further developments led to a much more 
sophisticated system. 
A next crucial step in connecting computers was the development of the World 
Wide Web, which was achieved by Tim Berners-Lee. Berners-Lee was an English 
physicist working at the international physics lab in Switzerland, known as CERN, 
where he noted that the various scientists from diff erent countries could not share 
information from computer to computer. He wanted to solve that problem. His goal 
was to fi nd a way to connect computers and share information, lots of information. 
In 1990, Berners-Lee found a way to create a common system so the information 
within fi les could easily be shared from computer to computer. He created a language 
for formatting fi les in hypertext so they could be read in the same way by the sending 
and receiving computers, and he called the language Hypertext Markup Language, or 
HTML. In addition, he developed a method of moving fi les of information, which he 
called the World Wide Web (WWW) , although in the beginning, it connected only 
the computers within the laboratories at CERN. By the end of 1990, the World Wide 
Web was up and running within the small research community at CERN. By August 
1991, it was being made available at select Internet sites around the world, and by 
1992, it was being used by more and more people who were creating their own websites 
to send and receive hypertext information through the Internet. 
In the early 1990s, the WWW was still primitive, but many also saw it as revolutionary. 
Berners-Lee made another crucial decision. Although he could have gotten 
rich off of his invention, he insisted that the World Wide Web would be free. On April 
30, 1993, CERN announced that anyone, anywhere in the world could use the Web 
without payment of royalties or legal constraints. Th e information superhighway, as 
Tennessee Senator Al Gore would call it, was launched. (Gore did not “invent” the 
Internet but he did coin the term “information superhighway” in 1990 and sponsored 
legislation to support it in Congress.) 
People needed the right soft ware on their own computers to connect to the World 
Wide Web. One of the earliest soft wares, and the fi rst to be available at no cost, was 
produced by Marc Andreesen, a 21-year-old computer science major at the University 
of Illinois. In January 1993, he posted an announcement that said, “By the power vested 
in me by nobody in particular, alpha/beta version of 0.5 of NCSA’s Motif-based information 
system and World Wide Web browser, X Mosaic, is hereby released, Cheers, 
Marc.” Andreesen then moved to California and was recruited by venture capitalist 
Jim Clark to develop a more sophisticated connection system, and in October 1994, 
Netscape was launched as a browser. Soon thousands of people in the United States 
and around the world were connecting to the Internet for the fi rst time using Netscape 
Navigator to get to the Netscape home page and from there to the world. Other systems, 
America Online (AOL) and Yahoo!, soon followed. Before long, Bill Gates was leading

servers that allows the exchange of e-mail,

Microsoft in the development and distribution of its own Web browser. By 1998, over 
45 million people—quite a jump from 15,000 in 1990—were connected to the World 
Wide Web. People could shop, do research, listen to music, or tour the world, without 
leaving the comfort of their own homes. 
E-mail messages began replacing telephone calls and office memos in the late 
1990s. Ray Tomlinson, a researcher working at the Defense Department inaugurated 
the use of @ as the core of an e-mail address. In the 1990s, people embraced the opportunity 
to send and receive messages at times of their own convenience rather than to 
have to answer the telephone. With the growth of television in the 1950s, some had 
worried that the printed word was in decline. Aft er 2000, the reliance on text certainly 
saw a resurgence, even if in abbreviated form, as e-mail messages replaced telephone 
calls as the prime source of communication among Americans. 
The Dot.com Bubble and Its Eventual Burst 
If Y2K illustrated the degree to which almost every aspect of society had become 
dependent on computer technology by 2000, the bursting of the dot.com bubble illustrated 
how easy it was to infl ate the value of every computer-related enterprise. Just 
as the world of electronic communications was being born in the 1990s, many people 
decided that the key to making a fortune was investing in the enterprise. As had happened 
many times before (see Chapter 22 on the stock market crash of 1929) , overeager 
investors created a bubble that eventually burst. 
In March 2000, an article in Barrons , the respected business magazine, asked, 
“When will the Internet Bubble burst?” A week later, Business Week ran a story on 
Internet stocks called “Wall Street’s Hype Machine.” Investors, some of whom were 
already beginning to have their own worries, paid attention. At the end of March 
and all through April 2000, stocks in high technology companies fell dramatically. 
Between March 10 and April 14, Yahoo! fell from 178 to 116. By the end of December 
2000, nearly every technology company was down signifi cantly. Some, like Amazon. 
com , recovered. Others did not. Th e value of specifi c parts of the new electronic world 
had shrunk, but the new electronic order was just beginning. 
Google Becomes a Verb 
In September 1998, two Stanford University graduate students, Larry Page and Sergey 
Brin, launched a new company in a garage in Menlo Park, California. Th ey called their 
company Google. Page and Brin fi rst met at Stanford in 1995, and by 1996, they had 
decided to search for and fi nd information through the still-new World Wide Web. 
Other search engines predated Google, and others rose to challenge its dominance, but 
it quickly became the leader. As early as December 1998, a computer magazine was 
reporting Google’s “uncanny knack” for producing good information very quickly, and 
by 2001, one could search for information on Google in 26 languages. 
By December 2001, Page and Brin’s company had scanned or indexed 3 billion webpages, 
almost 80 percent of the total then in existence. And as the number of webpages 
grew, Google kept scanning and indexing. When someone in any corner of the globe 
typed a question or a name or a topic into the google.com search page, a series of interconnected 
computers at Google headquarters in Mountain View, California, scanned the 
data and presented a list of websites to the searcher. With the advent of Google, virtually 
all of the knowledge available anywhere on the Internet was available at the click of a few 
key strokes to everyone, not just computer geeks with unlimited time and patience. 
Google never charged for its services, which along with its speed, was a key to its 
popularity. Th e company’s main source of revenue came from advertisements. Hotels 
in London may pay to get top billing when someone does a search of “London,” while 
sporting goods companies may pay for top billing when a search is done for “sneakers.” 
In the years after its founding, Google kept up the rapid pace of growth and 
change. In 2004, Google launched Google Books. Th e company signed agreements

with a number of prominent libraries, including Harvard, Stanford, the University 
of Michigan, Oxford University, the Library of Congress, and the New York Public 
Library to digitize all of their holdings. The books whose copyrights had expired 
would be made available online. Books still under copyright—which included most 
books—would have only small selections available, considered “fair use,” and readers 
would be referred to the publisher for more. However, publishers were nervous 
about the fact that the whole book would be stored in Google’s electronic archives, 
and in 2005, the Association of American Publishers sued the company for violation 
of copyright laws. In response, John L. Hennessy, the president of Stanford University 
and a member of Google’s board of directors, said, “We need to rethink our copyright 
framework that is still a remnant of the past.” Th e nature of copyrights and, indeed, 
the printed page, would be in for dramatic changes. 
The Latest Technology—Winners, Losers, and Change Agents 
Soon aft er 2000, the fast-paced technological changes were producing some clear winners: 
companies like Google and Microsoft and the thousands of engineers and inventors 
who worked in places like Silicon Valley in California or Seattle, Washington. In 
addition, there were also clear losers. 
When the Sony Walkman cassette tape player appeared in 1979, it seemed part of 
a never-ending expansion of the music industry. People could buy music and listen as 
they walked or worked. By 2001, however, the music industry was in deep trouble. New 
technologies gave consumers the power to simply download the music they wanted, at 
no cost. In the 1990s, the bestselling album sold 15 million copies. In 1999 alone, the 
music industry reported profi ts of $14.6 billion, but in retrospect, that point was the 
peak year for the industry’s profi ts. Th at number would fall to $6.3 billion in 2009. It 
was just too easy to download music, share it, and give it away. In 2001, representatives 
of the music industry were successful in a lawsuit closing Napster, one of the fi rst vehicles 
for downloading music that had been launched in 1999, but the move was a public 
relations disaster because other technology for downloading made it easier and easier 
even without the help of Napster. If the industry was going to survive aft er 2001, then 
it would need to fi nd a new way to create, market, and profi t from music products. 
Newspapers went through similar losses. After 2000, newspaper advertising, 
which generates most of newspaper revenue, fell dramatically, as did the actual sales 
of newspapers. Circulation kept dropping for most newspapers and some, like the Los 
Angeles Times and the Boston Globe, lost perhaps a third of all subscribers between 
2000 and 2010. Many of these papers began small online versions, but readers had 
already become accustomed to accessing other news sites that had been designed specifi 
cally for online readers. Newspapers have yet to recover, if they ever will. 
Many people also began to worry about the loss of privacy that can accompany 
growing information technology. Certainly, Google held a lot of information, not just 
on products but on people who search for information. E-mail was much easier to 
hack into and read than traditional letters or telephone calls, and the federal protection 
of privacy, especially in letters sent through the U.S. mail, did not apply to much 
of the new technology. Mobile phones made it easy to call from anywhere, but they 
also made it easy for people to track anyone’s location. Privacy, as civil libertarians 
had traditionally defi ned it, was a fast-changing matter. 
In the decades aft er 2001, technology kept changing the way people lived their lives 
and interacted with others. A world without e-mail or without the ability to search the 
World Wide Web or listen to music or follow one’s friends on Facebook became virtually 
unimaginable. Yet before the 1990s, such a world did not exist. In that decade, 
the foundation for the technological future was set.

Chapter 29 A New World Order 919 
CONCLUSION 
In 1989, the Cold War came to an end and “a new world order” began to take shape. 
Aft er Reagan’s second term, when George H.W. Bush, a foreign policy expert, took 
offi ce in 1989, he was well positioned to see the United States through the dissolution 
of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War. But as soon as the Cold War had 
ended, other international crises immediately began to preoccupy the Bush administration. 
During his term in offi ce, Bush sent U.S. troops to Iraq to protect the independence 
of Kuwait, ordered the overthrow of Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega, and 
sent peacekeeping troops to both Somalia and Yugoslavia. Amid this international turmoil, 
the Bush administration also had to confront the increasing threat of al-Qaeda 
and other nonstate terrorist organizations. 
While Bush focused on international issues, the U.S. economy fell into a recession, 
and when he raised taxes, despite an earlier promise not to do so, the conservative wing 
of the Republican Party abandoned him. Division within the Republican Party and the 
troubled economy allowed Democratic candidate Bill Clinton, whose campaign team 
motto was “It’s the economy, stupid,” to defeat Bush in his bid for reelection. 
Clinton focused on two primary issues early in his administration: the economy 
and the nation’s health care system. He managed, with the help of a Democraticcontrolled 
Congress, to balance the federal budget, lower the national debt, and 
secure approval for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), but his 
health care plan faltered before it reached the U.S. Congress for a vote. Two years into 
Clinton’s fi rst term, Republicans took control of the House of Representatives, forcing 
him to further moderate his positions. In his remaining 6 years in offi ce, Clinton 
worked with Republicans to limit some budget cuts, end the nation’s traditional welfare 
system, and pass the Defense of Marriage Act. Although Clinton faced impeachment 
stemming from charges that he had lied under oath about a sexual aff air, he 
kept his offi ce. 
The 1990s concluded with one of the strangest presidential elections in 
American history. It took over one month and a decision of the U.S. Supreme 
Court to determine that George W. Bush, not Al Gore, would succeed Clinton as 
president. 
With the rise of new international issues as well as economic and social issues 
at home, dramatic developments in technology launched a new information era. 
Personal computers, which fi rst became available in the 1980s, became commonplace 
in the 1990s. New companies like Apple, Microsoft, and Google emerged, 
and existing companies like IBM and Xerox adapted to changing technologies. In 
the 1990s, developments such as the Internet and the World Wide Web allowed 
people to connect and communicate at speeds never before thought possible. 
Th ese advances also ushered in an era of speculation among overeager investors. 
Technology stocks grew steadily throughout the 1990s, but, in March 2000, the tech 
bubble burst and many people lost jobs and savings. By the end of the decade, technology 
had become so pervasive in American life that many feared a catastrophic 
Y2K problem if computers malfunctioned on January 1, 2000. In addition, concern 
grew about the computer’s impact on a range of existing institutions from the music 
industry to books and newspapers as well as the impact of computers on personal 
privacy. Nevertheless, by 2001, it was clear that the transformation of life as a result 
of technology was here to stay.

How did changes in the 1990s connect the United States to the rest of the world

Chapter 29 Summary and Review 
THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION, 1989–1993 
29.1 Explain the New World Order that George Bush described. 
Summary 
George H. W. Bush’s primary interest was foreign policy. Th e 
Bush team was initially skeptical of the speed with which 
Reagan and Gorbachev had reached agreements, but developments 
in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe soon gathered 
even more speed. Th e collapse of Soviet control over Eastern 
Europe and the subsequent dissolution of the Soviet Union 
itself left a vastly different world in their wake. At the same 
time, China’s communist leaders had no intention of relaxing 
their authority as Gorbachev did in the Soviet Union. Bush 
wanted closer diplomatic and commercial ties with China, 
but the Chinese crackdown on internal protest and dissent left 
the future of U.S.–China relations uncertain. In the Middle 
East, the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait led to war between Iraq 
and a U.S.-led international coalition. While victory in the 
Persian Gulf War was swift and involved relatively little loss of 
American lives, the long-term consequences of the war would 
prove profound. In domestic aff airs, Bush placed a high priority 
on education, led the fi ght for the Americans with Disabilities 
Act, and supported the Clean Air Act. At the same time, he 
continued the Reagan assault on big government and nominated 
Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court. Racial issues 
were a central part of the Th omas nomination hearings, and the 
Rodney King incident and its aft ermath illustrated how deeply 
lines were still drawn between races in the United States in the 
1990s. A weak economy and Bush’s decision to raise taxes left 
him politically vulnerable, allowing a relative unknown, Bill 
Clinton, to win the White House in 1992. 
Review Questions 
1. Comparison

THE CLINTON PRESIDENCY 
29.2 
Analyze the impact of the Clinton presidency and the Clinton– 
Gingrich confl ict on the country. 
Summary 
Bill Clinton’s first term in office produced mixed results. On 
the one hand, he secured the passage of a deficit-reducing 
budget, AmeriCorps, the Family and Medical Leave Act, 
Goals 2000, and the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
On the other hand, his health care plan was defeated, he was 
forced into a compromise on gays in the military, and in 1994, 
the Republicans took control of the House of Representatives. 
Clinton won a battle with House leaders over a government 
shutdown resulting from budget impasses, but moved to the 
right in a number of ways, lending his support to new limits 
on federal welfare and to the Defense of Marriage Act. Clinton 
won reelection in 1996, but the Republicans gained majorities 
in both houses of Congress. Throughout the 1990s, partisan 
divisions grew sharper as the Republican Party became more 
conservative and the Democratic Party became more liberal. 
Clinton emphasized domestic policy, but he was forced to deal 
with events in the Middle East, the former Yugoslavia, Haiti, 
and central Africa. During Clinton’s presidency the threat of 
terrorism, both foreign and domestic, grew. An impeachment 
trial that was centered on Clinton’s aff air with Monica Lewinsky 
derailed Clinton’s second term, but did not result in his conviction. 
Despite the ups and downs of Clinton’s personal political 
fortunes, the 1990s were a prosperous decade. Th is prosperity, 
however, was not enough to guarantee Vice President Al Gore 
victory in the 2000 presidential election. Court challenges to 
Gore’s request for a recount of votes in Florida went all the way 
to the Supreme Court, where the Court ruled by a 5-4 margin 
in favor of George W. Bush. All fi ve of the justices who voted to 
end the recount had been appointed by Reagan and Bush, Sr.

facilitated the creation of dense connections between organizations 
and individuals. As was the case with computers, the 
Internet grew out of the search for military applications of new 
technology. Unwarranted investor enthusiasm for new and 
untested Internet business models led to a stock bubble and the 
dot.com crash of early 2000. Th e rise of Google to worldwide 
prominence underscored the power of the Internet to 
disseminate information. Th e Internet and personal computing 
posed economic challenges and opportunities, allowing some 
industries to grow rapidly and forcing others to reconsider 
long-standing business models.

The new technologies that would transform the world in the

Postwar innovations made mainframe computers common in 
American military, universities, and industry. While government 
played the dominant role in the development of mainframes, 
individual entrepreneurs spearheaded the development 
of personal computers. Th e growing dependency of the United

Tuesday morning on September 11, 2001, dawned clear and 
beautiful on the East Coast of the United States. President 
Bush was in Florida, reading to a class of second graders 
as part of his effort to get the No Child Left Behind legislation 
through Congress. Most Americans were going about their business 
at the beginning of another workweek as memories of summer 
vacations faded. At 7:59 a.m. American Airlines Flight 11 took off 
from Boston’s Logan International Airport bound for Los Angeles. 
In the minutes that followed, United Airlines Flight 93 left Newark 
for San Francisco; American Flight 77 left Washington, DC, for Los 
Angeles; and United Flight 175 left Boston for Los Angeles. None 
of those four fl ights made it to their intended destination. 
On each of the four planes, just minutes after takeoff, hijackers 
took control of the fl ight using box cutters—then legal to carry 
onto a plane—as weapons. Following existing procedures, designed 
for hijackers of an earlier era who oft en sought ransom or political 
concessions, airline crews yielded to the hijackers, and then quickly 
realized the new destinations. As terrifi ed crew and passengers used 
cell phones to call relatives and authorities, the planes turned back 
toward the East Coast. At 8:46 a.m., American Flight 11 crashed into 
the North Tower of the World Trade Center. Seventeen minutes later, 
United Flight 175 crashed into the South Tower of the Trade Center.

At 9:37 a.m., American Flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon. By this time, passengers on Signifi cant Dates 
United Flight 93 had learned from cell phone calls that they were part of a massive terrorist 
plot. As the plane headed for Washington, DC, heroic passengers overpowered 
the hijackers and the plane crashed in a fi eld in Somerset County, Pennsylvania. 
Many acts of heroism occurred on that chaotic morning. Betty Ong, a fl ight attendant 
on American Airlines Flight 11 stayed on her cell phone, reporting minute by 
minute until the plane crashed into the World Trade Center. In New York City, 
Nick Gerstle, a technician for Verizon, knew CPR and thought he could be helpful at 
Ground Zero—the now horrifi c site where the twin towers of the Trade Center had 
stood. In the midst of the rubble, he and some fi refi ghters found two trapped New 
York City police offi cers. He heard the offi cers say, “Please! Don’t let us die!” And they 
didn’t. Th e two offi cers were among the few rescued from the collapsed buildings. Julia 
Martinez and Margaret Espinoza were paraprofessionals—teacher aids—at the High 
School for Leadership and Public Service that was only a block away from the World 
Trade Center. Th ey began moving two wheelchair-bound students out of the chaos, 
found their way blocked by debris and, with the aid of two strangers, simply picked up 
the girls and carried them to safety blocks away. New Yorkers, Pentagon employees, 
passengers on the fl ights, and average Americans did heroic things. Th at day changed 
history as few others had. Th e focus of this chapter is on the decade and more aft er that 
tragic day during which public and personal events were shadowed by what came to be 
called simply 9/11. 
THE IMPACT OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 
Analyze the impact of 9/11 on the nation and presidency of George Bush and the impact of 
Bush administration policies around the world. 
In the fi rst moments and hours aft er the horrifi c crashes, no one knew what to make 
of the attack on the World Trade Center and Pentagon. On fi rst hearing the news on 
radio or TV, most people had the same reaction as Florence Engoran, who worked 
in the South Tower of the World Trade Center. When she arrived at her offi ce on the 
55th fl oor someone said, “A small plane hit the other building.” She remembered, “I 
wasn’t especially upset by the news,” and tended to agree with her coworker who said, 
“Oh, just sit down, let’s keep working. We have to get out some focus reports.” Within 
minutes, however, as she saw fl ames and heard another crash, Engoran realized that 
something much more serious was happening. Although she was 5 months pregnant, 
Engoran headed for the stairs and walked down the 55 fl ights. Before she made it to the 
bottom, the lights were off and the stairwell was fi lled with dust, but she made it. Most 
of those working in the buildings made it out. But many did not. Handicapped people 
who could not walk down the stairs were stuck. People on the higher fl oors could not 
get past the fi res. Some 78 police offi cers and 400 fi refi ghters who had responded to the 
emergencies remained in the buildings trying to evacuate people when the structures 
collapsed. It all happened very fast. At 9:58 a.m., just 1 hour aft er the crash, the South 
Tower of the World Trade Center collapsed fl oor by fl oor, showering a wide area with 
rubble. Th irty minutes later, the North Tower also collapsed. What had been two of the 
tallest buildings in the world that morning were now simply a giant hole in the ground. 
Th e worst violence on United States soil since the Civil War had just taken place. 
Nearly 3,000 people died—246 passengers on the planes; 2,600 at the World Trade 
Center, including workers in the two towers, police and fi re rescue workers, and a few 
unlucky passersby; and 125 people at the Pentagon. Th e fear, loss, anger, and fortitude 
generated from that day would shape a new reality for the nation. 
At 9:30 a.m., the Federal Aviation Administration grounded all fl ights within the 
United States. For the week that followed, the skies would be clear of everything but 
high-fl ying military planes. Airports would be eerily quiet. At a little aft er 1:00 p.m. 
that Tuesday, President Bush, just 9 months into his fi rst term, addressed the nation

from an Air Force base in Louisiana, telling people that massive security measures 
were in eff ect and that the United States would “hunt down and punish those responsible 
for these cowardly acts,” though at that point no one was quite sure who they 
were. At 8:30 p.m., President Bush spoke to the nation for a second time, this time 
from the Oval Offi ce, asking for prayers for the families and friends of the victims and 
again promising retaliatory action. Ground Zero was still a mass of burning rubble 
and would be for weeks. Th e Pentagon fi re was contained, but not under control. Th e 
nation tried to make sense of what had happened. 
Finding the Terrorists—al-Qaeda, the Taliban, Afghanistan 
In the initial confusion of the morning of September 11, no one was quite sure who 
was behind the attack. By early afternoon, George Tenet, the director of the CIA, 
informed President Bush that while the agency was still investigating, all the evidence 
pointed to an attack by al-Qaeda, ordered by its leader Osama bin Laden. By late that 
evening, when the president met with what he then called his “war council,” they all 
agreed that plans needed to be developed to punish not only the perpetrators of the 
9/11 attack but any who harbored them. 
On September 20, President Bush spoke to a joint session of Congress. He said, 
“Tonight, we are a country awakened to danger.” He said of the government of 
Afghanistan that “Th ey will hand over the terrorists, or they will share their fate.” And 
he told the rest of the world, “Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.” 
Th ere would be no neutrals in the war on terror. Th e president said that the war was 
with terrorists, not with Islam. He insisted, “Th e enemy of America is not our many 
Muslim friends. It is not our many Arab friends. Our enemy is a radical network of 
terrorists, and every government that supports them.” Nevertheless, the militant tone 
of the speech, while reassuring some, worried many. In the immediate aft ermath of 
the attacks, international support and sympathy for the United States was high. Even 
nations long hostile to the United States such as Syria were expressing support. But 
with Bush’s response, some of the support began to fade.

Everyone who lived through the day had their own experience of 
9/11, one they will not forget. Twelve years later a Los Angeles 
Times reporter looked back on his own memories and those of 
others who contacted him. 
Even 12 years later, the events of Sept. 11, 2001, sear 
Americans’ memories. 
In comments posted on latimes.com , people remember the 
tragic events of the day -- the moments, both good and bad, 
heroic and fearful, that are summed up by the numerals 9/11. 
It was early morning when the first airplane hit one of the 
towers of the World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan. On the 
East Coast, commuters were rushing to their jobs, schools were 
filling with educators and students. It seemed an ordinary day 
until 8:46 a.m., when it wasn’t. 
“On 9/11/2001 I was having a national sales meeting in our 
offices at the World Trade Center. We had visitors from Chicago, 
California and New Orleans. Everyone was looking forward to 
getting together to recharge,” writes Keith Webster of Malibu. 
“At 8:45 a.m. while standing in our boardroom looking at the 
Statue of Liberty in the south harbor, all hell was about to break 
loose. We heard a pop then a swoosh. A stream of debris crossed 
the sky. It looked like a ticker tape parade but only a few thousand 
feet higher. 
“In an instant, I knew what was happening, in my mind’s eye 
an image of a terrorist walking onto my floor with a bomb vest 
flashed. I could see my lobby vaporized and in flames.” 
Webster also writes about his eventual rescue by heroic 
responders. 
Maralynn Mash of Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., says she was at an 
elementary school near the World Trade Center that day. 
“The children were headed toward the basement for safety 
when police and fire officials came into the building thinking 
it was empty… .But then we were directed to run … run for 
your lives. Teachers and students, under the guidance of an 
incredibly able principal, ran ahead of the second ‘cloud’ north 
on Greenwich… . What I remember is a day of bravery, a year of 
dedication in response to an act of cowardice. So very proud to 
be a New Yorker and an American.” 
On the West Coast, people were just waking up; many 
watched the tragedy in New York unfold on television. Instead 
of the usual fodder of second-day news, lifestyle features and 
celebrity pomp, viewers saw the horror of the deadliest terrorist 
attack on U.S. soil. 
“The images of the towers crashing and exploding gave me 
a sense of insecurity that something like this could happen in 
downtown Los Angeles,” writes Maricela of La Puente. 
“I remember arriving at Raymond A. Villa Intermediate School 
in Santa Ana, Calif. It was an ordinary day. I hung out with my 
friends for a little bit, headed to first period, sat at my desk, the 
usual. I was in sixth grade at the time. Around the middle of class 
… my teacher put the TV on,” writes Lene De Leon, now of San 
Antonio. 
“I will never forget the images or the confusion I felt upon 
seeing the videos replaying over and over again. I tried so hard 
not to cry for fear of being made fun of, but I was hurting for 
all those people and my country. Everything happening was so 
painful to watch. The second plane hitting, people desperate for 
help and waving white ‘flags’ out of the windows, people jumping 
out of the windows, the towers falling. All the images were 
engraved in my memory and are still vivid.” 
They are etched onto the nation’s soul nation too, and are 
freshly renewed every 9/11 as officials, relatives and mourners 
gather in New York, Pennsylvania and Washington. In all, nearly 
3,000 people died. 
As Kendra of Auburn, Ala., writes, “Mom said to me, ‘This day 
will be a day to remember for the rest of your life.’ ”

By the time Bush spoke, CIA and U.S. Army forces had been dispatched to 
Pakistan and Uzbekistan to prepare for an attack on Afghanistan, whose Taliban 
government was protecting bin Laden and al-Qaeda. In early October, the United 
States attacked sites within Afghanistan while building on-the-ground alliances with 
Afghan warlords who were hostile to the Taliban regime. Soon, U.S. ground forces, 
allied with the warlords, began an assault on the Taliban government. On November 
9, the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif fell to the U.S.-led coalition forces, and a few 
days later, the Taliban government fl ed the capital of Kabul. By early December, the 
United States and its local allies were in control of the country, and on December 22,

Hamid Karzai, a leader of one of the anti-Taliban factions, was installed as the new 
leader of Afghanistan. For the most part, however, the Taliban leaders had escaped. 
Many Afghans celebrated the defeat of the austere and tyrannical Taliban even as 
they kept a wary eye on the Americans and on each other. Late in 2001, U.S.-backed 
forces attacked the remaining al-Qaeda strongholds in a region of mountainous caves 
known as Tora Bora. Perhaps a quarter of all al-Qaeda and Taliban operatives were 
killed or captured, but the rest, including bin Laden and his chief lieutenant Ayman 
al-Zawahiri, escaped into the lightly governed provinces on the Pakistani side of the 
border from which they continued to operate with considerable freedom. Th e United 
States did not track bin Laden down until May 2011, almost 10 years later. 
In the aft ermath of the attack, President Bush, under considerable pressure from 
families of victims, agreed to appoint a special commission to study the 9/11 attack 
and make recommendations regarding future policy. Th e chair of the commission, 
former Republican governor of New Jersey Thomas Kean, and vice chair, Lee H. 
Hamilton, former Democratic representative from Indiana, were careful to say, “We 
write with the benefi t and handicap of hindsight. We are mindful of the danger of 
being unjust to men and women who made choices in conditions of uncertainty and 
in circumstances over which they oft en had little control.” Nevertheless, they noted 
signifi cant mistakes. Th ey reported that while presidents and CIA directors are inundated 
with information, a lot of information had pointed to a possible large scale 
al-Qaeda attack. As early as December 1998, the CIA’s Presidential Daily Brief for 
Bill Clinton said, “___ suggests bin Laden and his allies are preparing for attacks on 
U.S., including an aircraft hijacking.” A report to George W. Bush on August 6, 2001, 
included a detailed note headlined, “bin Laden Determined to Strike in US.” Th ey also 
noted that the United States was unprepared for dealing with an attack. Although Air 
Force planes were launched aft er the fi rst plane crashed into the World Trade Center, 
the pilots had no clear instructions, and the commission had great doubts that, if the 
passengers had not caused the fourth plane to crash in Pennsylvania, it could have 
been stopped before reaching Washington, DC. “Th e most important failure,” they 
concluded, “was one of imagination. We do not believe leaders understood the gravity 
of the threat.” Th e terrorist danger from bin Laden and al-Qaeda was not a major 
topic for policy debate among the public, the media, or in the Congress. It had barely 
come up during the 2000 presidential campaign. 
While the defeat of the Taliban brought new opportunities to many Afghans, especially women who could 
again study in school and take jobs, it did not bring stability to the country.

The George W. Bush Presidential Agenda 
Once in offi ce in January 2001, George W. Bush did not waste any time implementing 
his own agenda. While the events of the following September would make foreign 
policy central to that agenda, he did not come to offi ce with such a focus. Indeed, most 
early initiatives focused on domestic policy. As his administration took shape, especially 
his choices for members of his cabinet, many wondered about his promise to be 
a “uniter.” He had selected a cabinet with more racial minorities and more women than 
any previous one, but they were a very conservative lot. 
Three days after the inauguration, Bush announced that he would use the upcoming 
renewal of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, fi rst passed under Lyndon 
Johnson in 1965 (see Chapter 22 ) to change the course of federal education policy. He had 
campaigned on a promise to address what he called the “soft bigotry of low expectations” for 
poor students, and he acted quickly on that promise. He called his new proposal No Child 
Left Behind and announced he would seek a bipartisan education reform that would be “the 
cornerstone of my administration.” In spite of the highly partisan split around his election, 
two of the most liberal Democratic members of Congress, Massachusetts senator Edward M. 
Kennedy and California House member George Miller played key roles in developing the act 
and shepherding it through Congress. Th e core of No Child Left Behind was a requirement 
that to receive federal funds states must develop clear standards, then test all students from 
the third to the eighth grade, and use the test results to measure whether individual schools 
and districts were making “adequate yearly progress” (AYP) in improving the education of 
all students and closing the “achievement gap.” Although many supported the legislation, 
its implementation quickly generated criticism of the amount of testing involved, the constraints 
imposed by the regulations, and the lack of funding available for implementation. 
Bush moved with equal speed on his other top priority, an across-the-board tax 
cut. During the campaign, he had insisted that the Clinton budget surpluses should 
be given directly back to taxpayers. Alan Greenspan of the Federal Reserve Board told 
Congress that Bush’s proposed tax cut of $1.6 trillion over 10 years would not harm 
the economy and might do some good. Th ere was general consensus about some sort 
of cut, and Bush was able to sign a phased-in tax cut of $ 1.4 trillion on June 7, 2001, 
less than 5 months aft er the inauguration. Th e new law cut the highest tax rate from 
No Child Left Behind 
Federal legislation requiring that all students 
be tested and that schools show “adequate 
yearly progress” in the test scores of all 
students. 
American classrooms like this one were transformed by the expectations included in the No Child Left 
Behind legislation. In this 2003 photo, Ron Paige, secretary of the Department of Education under George W. 
Bush, answers questions from students during a visit to the Skinner Magnet Center in Omaha, Nebraska.

39.6 percent to 35 percent—a signifi cant cut though still above the Reagan rates. It also 
created a new lower tax bracket of only 10 percent for the working poor, exempted 
many people from any federal tax, and phased out inheritance taxes. Almost immediately, 
many tax payers received rebate checks. Cutting taxes was a very popular policy. 
Th e tax cut legislation, however, posed two serious problems. Th e fi rst was that 
most of the major cuts were to be phased in, and people were impatient. Pressure 
mounted to speed up the implementation of the tax cuts, and in less than 2 years, 
Bush proposed and Congress passed the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation 
Act of 2003, which speeded tax reductions signifi cantly. Th e second problem was that, 
with reduced taxes, the U.S. Treasury took in a lot less money. While some, especially 
within the administration, argued that the tax cuts were stimulating the economy and 
creating jobs, most economists outside of government saw little evidence for the claim. 
Both sides had to acknowledge that the tax cuts—along with signifi cantly increased 
spending by the administration, especially aft er 9/11—were creating a growing federal 
defi cit. Th e surpluses of the late Clinton years disappeared. For the rest of the Bush 
term, the federal defi cit grew signifi cantly. Some, like Vice President Dick Cheney, said 
“Defi cits don’t matter.” Economists and many leaders of both parties were less sure. 
Education reform and tax cuts were the most signifi cant domestic policy agendas of 
George W. Bush’s 8 years in offi ce, and both were enacted during his fi rst year. A number 
of other policy initiatives, however, were also important to the president. Bush came 
to offi ce committed to what he called “faith-based initiatives.” He believed that religious 
communities were oft en better than the federal government at delivering direct human 
services. Nine days aft er the inauguration, he proposed what he called “charitable choice” 
legislation that would allow religious groups to apply for federal funds as long as they were 
not to be used for worship or proselytizing. While legislation made it through the House, 
two diff erent bills were blocked in the Senate. In frustration, Bush issued executive orders 
in December 2002 that prohibited federal agencies from discriminating against religious 
charities and established faith-based offi ces in several cabinet departments. For religious 
communities that sought federal funds, it created an especially friendly atmosphere. 
Bush had also campaigned on a promise to reform Social Security, giving individuals 
greater choice in the investment of the funds they contributed to the Social Security 
system. While other priorities dominated his early years, Bush devoted a signifi cant 
amount of his 2005 State of the Union speech—the fi rst of his second term—to his 
proposal to allow more choice in the use of Social Security funds. By 2005, however, 
Bush was distracted by the war, and Democrats were far less willing to give in to the 
president’s initiatives. Little movement happened on allowing greater choice in Social 
Security, and aft er the 2008 fi nancial crisis, when people realized that such choices 
might have been fi nancially devastating, the idea died. 
Bush had little patience with conservationists. He signed legislation allowing drilling 
in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska and supported off shore oil exploration. 
He did not move on environmental issues or global warming. Because of his own religious 
convictions, he opposed stem cell research in spite of dramatic appeals from many, 
including Nancy Reagan. His appointments, especially to the federal courts, tended 
to be very conservative. While the 2000 presidential election had been fought almost 
exclusively over domestic issues, the events of September 11, 2001, changed everything. 
From then onward, foreign policy and the impact of international issues on the internal 
politics of the United States would be the dominant agenda of the Bush administration 
until his last few months in offi ce when a new economic crisis returned attention to the 
domestic agenda. In the meantime, however, terrorism took center stage. 
The War on Terror at Home 
Th e Report of the 9/11 Commission made recommendations to tighten security within 
the United States and abroad. However, they noted, “Many of our recommendations 
call for the government to increase its presence in our lives.…Th erefore, while

protecting our homeland, Americans should be mindful of threats to vital personal 
and civil liberties.” Whether the Bush administration, or the Obama administration 
that followed, kept the right balance has been a subject of continuing debate. 
Even before the Commission fi nished its work, Congress, at Bush’s request, passed 
the USA PATRIOT Act , which the president signed on October 26, 2001, only weeks 
aft er the attack. Th e act expanded not only the authority of the Department of Justice 
to search telephone, e-mail, medical, fi nancial, and library records without a court 
order but also the authority to increase monitoring of the U.S. borders and of noncitizens 
within the country. It also gave the Treasury the right to monitor fi nancial 
records and bank transactions. In the midst of the fears generated by 9/11, the Patriot 
Act passed by large majorities in both houses of Congress. Most defended the law’s 
provisions as necessary at a time of national emergency. Nevertheless, some were 
deeply troubled by the bill. Richard Armey, a conservative Republican member of the 
House, insisted that the act have a sunset provision and expire in 5 years. Wisconsin 
liberal Democratic senator Russell Feingold, the only member of the Senate to vote 
against the law, said, “Some have said rather cavalierly that in these diffi cult times, we 
must accept some reduction in our civil liberties in order to be secure. Of course, there 
is no doubt that if we lived in a police state, it would be easier to catch terrorists.…But 
that probably would not be a country in which we would want to live.” 
Th e debate about the Patriot Act continued long aft er it passed. In January 2003, 
the American Library Association, worried about increasing searches of library 
records, condemned the Patriot Act as “a present danger to the constitutional rights 
and privacy rights of library users.” Others disagreed. John Yoo, who had served as 
one of the lead attorneys in the U.S. Department of Justice advising president Bush, 
and Eric Posner, a law professor, wrote a piece for the American Enterprise Institute 
in December 2003 in which they said, “Th e worst thing about the Patriot Act is its 
Orwellian name.…If the act marginally reduces peacetime liberties, this is a reasonable 
price to pay for a valuable weapon against al-Qaeda.” While the debate continued, 
President Bush signed a renewed version of the Patriot Act in March 2006, and 
President Barack Obama signed two further extensions of the law in 2010 and 2011. 
The War in Afghanistan and Iraq 
From the moment the fi rst plane hit the World Trade Center, some people were convinced 
that Iraq’s Saddam Hussein was somehow behind it or at least allied with 
al-Qaeda. Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz insisted that Iraq had to be 
dealt with if terrorism was to be defeated. Vice President Cheney supported a U.S. 
attack on Iraq. Others urged caution. Th e CIA and others in the National Security 
Council initially found no “compelling case” against Iraq. Indeed, evidence showed 
considerable antipathy between the very religious al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden 
and a secular leader like Saddam Hussein in Iraq. So in the immediate aft ermath of 
9/11, the focus stayed on the al-Qaeda strongholds in Afghanistan (see Map 30-1). 
However, the issue of Iraq never went away. 
British Prime Minister Tony Blair supported plans for an attack on Iraq, but Jack 
Straw, Blair’s foreign minister, insisted, “Saddam was not threatening his neighbors, 
and his WMD [Weapons of Mass Destruction] capability was less than that of Libya, 
North Korea, or Iran.” 
As talk of a possible U.S. attack on Iraq circulated, an article appeared in the Wall 
Street Journal on August 15, 2002, by Brent Scowcroft , who had been the national 
security adviser in the administration of H.W. Bush. Scowcroft wrote, “Don’t attack 
Saddam.” He argued that such a war could lead to “Armageddon in the Middle East” 
and urged instead that the United States should “be pressing the United Nations 
Security Council to insist on an eff ective no-notice inspection regime for Iraq.” Some 
speculated that Scowcroft ’s article was, in fact, a warning from Bush’s father—a close 
friend of Scowcroft —but if it was, it came too late.

MAP 30-1 Afghanistan and Iraq. After a 2001 attack on the Taliban government of Afghanistan, the 
United States turned its attention to Iraq, which it attacked in 2003. 
In January 2002, just 4 months aft er the attacks in New York and Washington, 
DC, Bush gave his State of the Union message in which he singled out Iraq, along 
with Iran and North Korea, as an “axis of evil.” Bush said, “Iraq continues to fl aunt its 
hostility toward America and to support terror.…Th is is a regime that has something 
to hide from the civilized world.” A conservative columnist, Charles Krauthammer, 
wrote, “If there was a serious internal debate within the administration over what to 
do about Iraq, that debate is over.” 
Th e only remaining debate seems to have been whether the United States and Great 
Britain needed to seek authorization from the U.S. Congress and United Nations to attack 
Iraq. Although British Prime Minister Blair supported the attack on Iraq, he insisted on 
United Nations approval. Th e UN had imposed a fi nancial and trade embargo on Iraq 
aft er it invaded Kuwait and, among other things, required it to disclose and eliminate 
weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and to allow UN inspections to confi rm the status 
of any such weapons. U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell urged seeking support from 
Congress and the UN. Ever since the earlier 1991 U.S. war with Iraq over Kuwait, the 
United States had protected Kurds in northern Iraq and maintained a boycott of Iraqi 
oil. Now the United States was preparing to do much more. 
Aft er considerable debate, Congress voted to authorize the use of military force 
if diplomacy with Iraq failed. The resolution passed the Senate by a vote of 77 to

23 and the House by 296 to 133. While almost everyone supported the invasion of 
Afghanistan and the attack on al-Qaeda, divisions ran deep about Iraq. Th e two liberal 
Democratic senators from Massachusetts were divided. John Kerry said, “I believe 
that a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his [Saddam Hussein’s] hands 
is a threat, and a grave threat.” In contrast, the senior senator from Massachusetts, 
Edward M. Kennedy, voted no as did the most senior member of the Senate, West 
Virginia Senator Robert Byrd. A young Barack Obama had not yet been elected to the 
Senate but he told a rally, “Th is is a dumb war.” 
After the congressional vote, Colin Powell took the arguments to the United 
Nations Security Council. Powell put his personal prestige on the line to convince the 
Security Council of the need to topple Saddam Hussein’s government. Th e vote was 
15 to zero in favor. France, Russia, and China, all of which had grave reservations 
about a war in Iraq, hoped that the authorization would force Iraq to agree to tougher 
inspections to avoid an invasion. With authorization from Congress and the UN, the 
United States, Great Britain, and a coalition of other countries, most of whom sent 
only token forces, went to war and toppled Saddam Hussein with lightning speed. 
On March 19, 2003, U.S. forces began the war with a huge attack using bombers— 
over 1,500 fl ights a day—plus launching Navy cruise missiles. Th e U.S. military called 
it “shock and awe.” Aft er the air attack, ground forces moved across the country. By 
the fi rst week in April, the airport at Baghdad fell to U.S.-led troops and U.S. tanks 
roared into the capital city. Th e Iraqi Minister of Information was captured, most of 
the rest of the leadership fl ed, and Saddam Hussein was a fugitive in the country he 
had long dominated. U.S. and British casualties were very low. Th e war, it seemed, had 
been won skillfully. On May 1, President Bush announced, “Major combat operations 
in Iraq have ended. In the battle of Iraq, the United States and our allies have prevailed.” 
Th e next steps would not be so easy, however. 
Securing a country as large and as tightly regulated as Iraq was no easy task. Many 
Iraqis who were delighted to see Hussein gone were uneasy about the role of foreign 
troops in their country. An Iraqi professor told American reporter Anne Garrels, 
“You understand, you will now have to be in complete control, and we will resent you 
Read on MyHistoryLab 
Document George W. Bush, Address to the Nation on the Iraq Invasion, 2003 
Under a sign proclaiming “Mission Accomplished,” President Bush announced the end of combat operations 
in Iraq on May 1, 2004. The worst of America’s diffi culties in Iraq, however, were just beginning.

every step of the way.” In fact, the United States never sent enough forces to manage 
the country once the old government had been removed. Very little planning had 
gone into preparation for the postinvasion world of Iraq. Most offi cials assumed that 
Iraqis would quickly return to work. As Condoleezza Rice, then the national security 
adviser, said, “Th e concept was that we would defeat the army, but the institutions 
would hold, everything from ministries to police forces.” It did not happen. 
As soon as the old authority was gone, looters began to pillage government buildings. 
Th ey stole computers, televisions, and metal to be sold for scrap, which they raided from 
places such as towers holding communication lines and metal fi le cabinets fi lled with 
important documents. At the Central Bank, looters drilled into the vaults and ran out 
with the money, much of it in U.S. dollars or euros that could not be traced. Th ey broke 
into the National Museum and carried off 15,000 ancient objects of extraordinary value. 
Defense Secretary Rumsfeld responded, “Stuff happens.” Most Iraqis and people 
around the world were less understanding. One military advisor said, “We’re incompetent 
as far as they’re concerned.” In August 2003, Th omas Friedman wrote in the 
New York Times , “It would be a tragic irony if the greatest technological power in the 
history of the world came to the cradle of civilization with its revolutionary ideas and 
found itself defeated because it couldn’t keep the electricity on.” 
In May 2003, Secretary Rumsfeld appointed a U.S. diplomat, L. Paul “Jerry” Bremer, 
as head of the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) to bring order to Iraq. Bremer 
was an experienced diplomat, but he was not familiar with the Middle East. He set up 
his headquarters in the fortifi ed “Green Zone,” a former Hussein palace and issued 
two orders that in retrospect seemed a serious mistake. Modeling the fi rst order on the 
de-Nazifi cation of Germany aft er World War II, Bremer ordered the de-Baathifi cation 
of Iraq. Th e Baath Party had been Hussein’s political party, the only one allowed in 
the country. Government offi cials—senior offi cials, police offi cers, and teachers—were 
required to be members. Th e order that no member of the Baath Party could work in 
the new administration immediately threw some 30,000 to 50,000 out of work. Th e 
idea that ministries or the police could quickly be up and running was gone. 
A week later, Bremer dissolved the Iraqi army. Th e initial U.S. plans for a postwar 
government had focused on removing a few generals and then reestablishing the army 
since it was solid and had discipline as well as credibility inside Iraq. With his order, 
Bremer dissolved this source of structure and order. He also infuriated some 400,000 
Iraqi soldiers who thought they had been promised that, if they would not resist the 
Americans, they could keep their jobs aft er the war. Now they were out of their jobs 
and had lost their pensions, but still had access to arms. 
As it became clear that the United States did not have enough troops in Iraq to 
maintain order, Iraqis not only became angry at the Americans but also became angry 
at one another. Hussein’s dictatorship had maintained tight control over a country 
whose people were deeply divided. Within weeks, members of the Sunni Muslim 
minority, of which Hussein was a part and which had been the nation’s elite, were 
attacked by members of the Shiite Muslim majority. The Sunnis fought back. On 
August 29, two car bombs killed moderate Shiite leader Ayatollah Mohammad Baqir 
al-Hakim and 124 of his followers and destroyed the Mosque where they were worshipping. 
While Sunnis and Shiites fought in the center and south of the country, Iraqi 
Kurds in the north, who had been protected for 12 years by the “no fl y zone” now 
fought to maintain their autonomy. Reprisal followed reprisal. Within months of the 
victory, Iraq was close to a civil war, and the Americans were caught in the middle of 
it. More American soldiers were killed between May and October of 2003 in “postwar” 
fi ghting than from March to May of that year in the actual invasion. 
Between 2003 and 2004, U.S. forces searched the country, trying to fi nd weapons of 
mass destruction and the escaped dictator Saddam Hussein. In spite of the fact that those 
weapons had been one of the prime reasons for going to war, none were ever found. 
Hussein apparently had wanted to keep up the pretense that they existed to frighten the

April of 2003.

United States and his old enemies like Iran. In fact, the weapons were not there. Bush 
wrote in his Memoirs , “In retrospect, of course, we all should have pushed harder on the 
intelligence and revisited our assumptions.” However, Hussein himself was found not 
far from his hometown of Tikrit in December 2003. Aft er an extended trial, Hussein 
was executed by the U.S.-backed provisional government of Iraq in December 2006. 
As Iraq spiraled into civil war, U.S. soldiers complained that they had no training 
for serving as an occupying force. In the city of Fallujah, some 2,500 marines battled 
with 1,200 dissidents in street-to-street, sometimes room-to-room fi ghting. In the end, 
the U.S. forces won but then withdrew from the city, and the dissidents regrouped. 
Similar battles took place elsewhere. Iraqi Sunnis made an alliance with al-Qaeda. Th e 
home-grown version of al-Qaeda in Iraq, known as al-Qaeda in Mesopotamia, grew 
stronger as much of the country experienced anarchy. Electricity worked in Baghdad 
for perhaps 8 hours a day, even in the summer when air conditioning was desperately 
needed. Oil was being pumped only at very low levels. 
Another disaster took place at a prison in Bagdad. Hussein had built Abu Ghraib 
Prison as a fortress prison for dissidents. By late summer 2003, Hussein’s prisoners had 
been freed and the U.S. military was using the prison to hold some 4,000 prisoners of 
their own. Th ey had orders from the Pentagon to “get information” from the new prisoners 
at Abu Ghraib. In the search for information, they humiliated prisoners by keeping 
some naked in front of female guards, by piling them on top of each other, and by making 
them crawl and bark. U.S. troops took pictures of what they were doing. In April 2004, the 
whole sordid mess at Abu Ghraib came to light. CBS News, the New Yorker magazine, and 
news organizations around the world, including Arab news sources like al Jazeera, showed 
the pictures and reported what was happening at Abu Ghraib. Hearing the reports, U.S. 
General James Mattis responded, “When you lose the moral high ground, you lose it all.” 
A year aft er the invasion, the U.S. commanding offi cer General Ricardo Sanchez 
described the situation as a “civil war” and added, “what’s more, we had created these 
conditions ourselves.” Paul Bremer said, “We’ve become the worst of all things—an 
ineff ective occupier.” 
At home in the United States, opposition to the war and the occupation was 
growing. Th ere were no weapons of mass destruction. Th ere was no order in Iraq. 
Th ere was no end in sight. 
Th e war in Iraq dominated U.S. elections. In the 2004 presidential contest, the 
Democrats nominated a Vietnam-era war hero, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts 
aft er a spirited contest in which Howard Dean, the 
governor of Vermont and a virtual unknown on 
the national stage, was the fi rst candidate to make 
the Internet the core of his campaign. Although 
the Dean campaign’s success at raising funds and 
recruiting volunteers did not lead to his nomination, 
it transformed future political campaigns. 
Once Kerry secured the Democratic nomination, 
the party united behind him and focused not only 
on the war in Iraq but also on Bush’s handling of 
the economy. Kerry had voted for the war, but he 
had become a major critic. He called the war and 
the subsequent U.S. occupation of Iraq a “colossal 
blunder,” and said that the president was 
“deliberately misleading the American people” 
about the war. Bush responded that the “world 
is better off without Saddam Hussein.” Outside 
political groups supporting Bush sought to tarnish 
Kerry’s military record. Kerry struck a chord 
with his criticism, but he was not a strong campaigner; 
indeed, one critic called him “a genius at

self-destruction.” In the end, the president won by a very small margin of 62 million 
to 59 million or 50.7 percent of the popular vote to Kerry’s 48.3 percent. Th e electoral 
vote was also close: 286 to 251. Nonetheless, Bush had won a second term. In addition, 
Republicans also maintained control of Congress. 
Two years later, protests against the war had grown much stronger as it continued 
into its fourth year. Although the president was not on the ballot, his policies 
were, and Democrats won a majority in both houses of Congress in the 2006 midterm 
elections. By 2006, the war’s cost in lives and dollars was a top issue in the election. 
Democrat Nancy Pelosi replaced Republican Dennis Hastert as Speaker of the House 
of Representatives, the fi rst woman in history to serve as speaker, and Democrat Harry 
Reid replaced Republican Mitch McConnell as majority leader in the Senate. Two new 
women were added to the Senate, bringing the total of women to 16—a then all-time 
high. Many thought the Republicans were going to be in trouble in the 2008 presidential 
election. In the meantime, President Bush knew he would face an unfriendly 
Congress during his last 2 years in offi ce. 
Looking at the situation in Iraq in 2006, one American official said, “We’ve 
taken Samarra four times, and we’ve lost it four times….We need a new strategy.” In 
November 2006, aft er the midterm elections, President Bush fi red Defense Secretary 
Rumsfeld and replaced him with Robert Gates, a less ideological administrator. A new 
U.S. ambassador to Iraq, Ryan Crocker, who spoke Arabic and who knew the Middle 
East well, was appointed. General David Petraeus was made the overall commander of 
military forces in the region. He developed a very diff erent strategy in Iraq. First there 
was “ the surge ,” an infusion of an additional 30,000 U.S. troops to provide strength in 
numbers. But instead of staying in fortifi ed enclaves, Petraeus placed units in population 
centers. Th eir mission was to get to know and protect the Iraqi people to fi nd out 
what their complaints were and try to respond. If troops took control of an area, they 
stayed and tried to build a new infrastructure. Troops felt vulnerable, and losses were 
high. Slowly, however, the troops and the Iraqi government began to take control of 
the country. By fall, one journalist reported from Baghdad, “Some shops stay open 
until late in the evening. Children play in parks, young women stay out aft er dark, 
restaurants are fi lled with families, and old men sit at sidewalk cafes playing backgammon 
and smoking shisha pipes.” It was a peace of sorts.

HURRICANE KATRINA AND ITS AFTERMATH 
Explain the impact of Hurricane Katrina on the Gulf Coast. 
Early Monday morning August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina , one of the most powerful 
and deadly hurricanes in American history, hit New Orleans and the Gulf Coast of 
Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. Hurricanes have naturally pounded Florida and 
the Gulf Coast since long before the fi rst Europeans or Africans arrived, but Katrina 
was a natural disaster compounded by human failure. Th e result was hours and days of 
anguish for many, over 1,800 deaths, and more than $75 billion in damage. 
The Failure to Prepare 
Only 4 years after it was founded, New Orleans was swept away by a hurricane in 
September 1722. In 1849, the levees protecting New Orleans failed, fl ooding more 
than 200 city blocks. Hurricanes in 1893 and 1919 fl ooded the city and killed many. 
Th e great Mississippi River fl ood of 1927 devastated the city. Aft er the 1927 fl oods, 
the Army Corps dredged the lower Mississippi River, which made for easier transport,

A plan for the handover of authority to a new 
government for Iraq and an eventual orderly 
withdrawal of all U.S. forces.

widespread death and destruction.

but changed the river’s course. Development and the pumping of oil and gas from 
underground further degraded the Mississippi Delta, and hundreds of square miles 
of swampland simply disappeared under water, leaving New Orleans much more 
vulnerable to storms coming from the Gulf of Mexico. In 2005, a giant storm arrived. 
As Hurricane Katrina began to strengthen in late August 2005, more immediate 
failures added dangerously to the already vulnerable area. Weather forecasters began to 
realize that Hurricane Katrina might be the “big one,” the hurricane that people feared. 
Nevertheless, New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin, Louisiana governor Kathleen Blanco, 
and Mississippi governor Haley Barbour all refused to issue mandatory evacuation 
orders. An off er by Amtrak to take people by train was ignored, and the last trains left 
the city with empty passenger cars. At least a quarter of New Orleans population did 
not own cars, and the school buses that could have been used to evacuate people sat 
idle and eventually fl ooded. 
As the storm grew stronger on Sunday morning August 28, Mayor Nagin opened 
the Superdome, the city’s massive sports complex, as a “shelter of last resort.” Some 
8,000 or 9,000 people moved in before the storm hit. However, most of the poorest 
people in New Orleans lived too far from the Superdome to get there, and no transportation 
was off ered. Th en Katrina hit. 
The Storm 
It started raining in Biloxi, Mississippi, around 5:00 p.m. on Sunday, August 28. By 
9:00 p.m., it was raining in New Orleans and the wind was starting to pick up. By 
midnight, the storm surge hit Mississippi. Between 2:00 and 6:00 a.m., the wind, rain, 
and storm surge was pounding the Gulf Coast and New Orleans. Winds were blowing 
steadily at 150 miles per hour. Sometime between 3:00 and 5:00 a.m., the levees on the 
17th Street Canal gave way. New Orleans lost electric power at 5:15 a.m. and telephone 
service at 7:11 a.m. 
Th e hurricane’s winds splintered buildings, toppled power lines, collapsed highway 
bridges, tore off part of the roof of the New Orleans Superdome, and stirred up 
waves on Lake Pontchartrain that weakened the levees. Th e wind also drove a huge 
surge of water onto the shore and up the Mississippi River. Finally, in New Orleans, 
the weakened levees failed and a wall of water poured into neighborhoods where it 
rose rapidly, destroyed buildings, and trapped people in upper fl oors and attics. 
Examples of the power of the storm were everywhere. In St. Bernard Parish, 
just across the Mississippi River from New Orleans, the rising water fi lled St. Rita’s 
Nursing Facility and 35 bedridden patients were drowned. In Waveland, Mississippi, 
where police were riding out the storm in the brick police headquarters, water fi lled 
the building and then the storm toppled it. Twenty-seven offi cers ended up swimming 
to safety, some clinging to a nearby tree for 3 hours before they were rescued. 
Th e worst destruction came in New Orleans itself, however, especially in its poorer 
neighborhoods. By the time Katrina hit New Orleans, almost 80 percent of its 485,000 
people had evacuated. Th e 100,000 or so who were left were those too stubborn or 
too poor to go anywhere. Th e Lower Ninth Ward had been a working class African- 
American community for generations. It had strong community institutions from 
churches to the neighborhood bars where jazz, blues, and iconic New Orleans-style 
music thrived. Th e area was 7 feet below sea level, but the levees were designed to keep 
the water out. People in the Lower Ninth Ward had no transport to the Superdome, 
no transport out of town, and few options rather than trying to ride out the storm. 
At 8:14 a.m., the Industrial Canal that brought cargo ships in but also channeled water 
away from the lower areas fi lled from the storm surge. Pumps failed, and the walls were 
breached. Within an hour, much of the Ninth Ward was fi lled with 6–8 feet of water, and 
the water kept rising. In a very short time, the Lower Ninth Ward was devastated. 
The most famous resident of the Lower Ninth Ward was the 77-year-old Fats 
Domino, the famous rock ‘n’ roll musician. Domino, his wife, and their fi ve children

and their families were riding out the storm at their house on Marais Street. Th en the 
water from the breech started pouring in and quickly rose to the top of fi rst fl oor. Th e 
water was full of mud, sewage, oil, and stank of death. Workers would later call it a toxic 
stew. With 8 feet of mud-fi lled water destroying everything in the house and reaching 
the ceiling, the family ran to the attic. Some neighbors thought they had all drowned, 
but the water in the Domino house did not rise higher. By aft ernoon, a New Orleans 
Harbor Police rescued the family. Fats Domino, his wife, and his children joined what 
was by then 20,000 survivors in the Superdome. Th e mementos of a lifetime were gone. 
The Cleanup 
Few failed to notice that the worse scenes of suffering and death were in African- 
American communities. Th e New Orleans Police Department was part of the problem. 
Many of the officers simply deserted their posts, leaving New Orleans to its own 
devices. Some of those who remained offered heroic help, but others were eventually 
convicted of criminal activity. In addition, the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency (FEMA) failed to live up to its responsibilities. FEMA had been created during 
the Carter administration to coordinate the diverse federal agencies that might be 
needed in the case of a natural disaster. However, for too long during Katrina and its 
aft ermath, FEMA did nothing. FEMA staff were asking, “Why aren’t we getting the 
orders? Why isn’t this being treated like a real emergency?” FEMA’s director in 2005, 
Michael Brown, was a political appointee with no experience in managing any disasters. 
When Brown assured Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour that “FEMA had 
lots of hurricane practice in Florida,” Barbour responded, “I don’t think you’ve seen 
anything like this.” It was one of the kinder statements Brown heard that week as people 
waited for federal help that did not come. 
Ninth ward residents stranded on the roof of their homes await rescue. The death and destruction that came 
with Hurricane Katrina was unimaginable to most Americans.

E veryone who lived through Hurricane Katrina has their own 
memories. Mary Gehman shares this one. 
All through the night gusts of incredibly heavy wind battered 
the house from the east side. It started out mild but eventually 
I was awakened by the noise, snug on my living room couch. 
I could only hope the upstairs rooms were going to hold tight.… 
Finally, about noon on Monday, the winds started to diminish. 
There were another few hours of rain and some gusts but the 
storm’s fury had been spent.…For about an hour or two late that 
afternoon, after the storm had quieted and the rain stopped, I 
enjoyed a sense of relief and self-righteous victory. I had been 
right to follow my gut feeling about being able to weather the 
hurricane. The water outside in the street had risen higher than I 
had ever seen it before in my 27 years living in the alley. It flowed 
fast, like a roiling creek, lapping the second step of my porch. 
By 5:00 p.m. that evening the creek outside my front steps 
had turned from a greenish grey to black, and the water was 
imperceptibly inching up. The flow had slowed somewhat, but 
there was no sign of it stopping or receding. With a sickening 
feeling, I watched as it came up to the threshold and began to 
ooze in under the front door. A few minutes later water pressed 
in through the baseboards: I knew we were in for a fight. The 
radio reported there had been a massive break in the 17th Street 
Canal levee and the water would rise farther before it stopped.… 
Hopefully, the water would stop in an hour or two. 
By Tuesday 3 a.m. the water had risen to cover the second 
step… as I eased into it from the slick hardwood stairs, it came up 
above my knees to mid-thigh, well over two feet deep.…The floor 
boards were slippery, coated I assumed by a film of oil and filth.… 
By about 3:00 that afternoon, I had pretty much made up my 
mind to get out. What to do about the dogs was the one remaining 
block. I knew the boats and helicopters that were picking 
people up were not taking large dogs …I glanced at the photos 
of my sons, their wives and my grandchildren on my night stand 
and thought how useless I’d be to them were I to be found dead, 
my two old dogs keeping guard over me. No, I had to prioritize 
things in a rational manner.… 
Out on the balcony I could not look at the dogs, not even as 
I set out a bucket of water and a dish of food for each.…It was 
dusk by the time a flat-bottomed boat manned by Bossier City, 
Louisiana, firefighters finally pulled up in the alley by the house 
where I was sitting on the roof peak. I scrambled down, grabbed 
the school bag and my purse, pulled the tall window shut behind 
me and handed my things down to a man in the boat. The Red 
Cross would be providing food and water, so no need to take more 
than the absolute minimum, the man in the boat assured me. The 
dogs pressed against me, and I petted them for the last time, my 
eyes welling over with tears.…All I know is that on my return to 
the house five weeks later, there was no trace of the dogs.… 
I don’t regret that I stayed through the storm—I was able 
to salvage a lot of important papers and items that are now of 
great comfort to me. The overpass will never feel the same to 
me as I pass over it nearly every day. My lovely dogs still haunt 
me. Their questioning faces swim up to the surface of my consciousness 
now and then—I tell them I left them for their own 
good. They seem to understand. They have no choice. None of 
us does.

Surviving Hurricane Katrina, Mary Gehman, 2005 
By Wednesday, August 31, 2 days aft er the storm, two hospitals in New Orleans, 
Charity and University, lost their generators. It was over 100 degrees in the hospitals. 
With no electricity, staff and volunteers used hand pumps to keep oxygen fl owing to 
desperately ill people. With virtually no water or supplies, only the most rudimentary 
medical aid was possible. Those in the Superdome were trying to survive in 
horrifying, primitive conditions with no sanitation and dead bodies laying exposed in 
hallways. Not until Th ursday were thousands of people fi nally evacuated to Houston, 
Texas, where shelter was offered. New Orleans never returned to its pre-Katrina 
population, and a year after the storm, whole neighborhoods were virtually abandoned 
even as others, like the Ninth Ward, slowly rebuilt and came back to life.

THE FINANCIAL CRISIS OF 2008 
Explain the costs and consequences of the 2008 financial crisis. 
Th e headline on the Wall Street Journal for Monday, September 15, 2008, was double 
the normal size and ran across all six columns of the paper. It said: 
CRISIS ON WALL STREET AS LEHMAN TOTTERS, MERRILL IS SOLD 
AND AIG SEEKS TO RAISE CASH 
By the time most people read the paper, Lehman was no longer tottering; the storied 
bank had declared bankruptcy. Bank of America bought Merrill Lynch, and bankers 
and federal authorities were trying to save the American International Group (AIG). 
Before the day was over, the stock market fell by 504.48 points. It would fall much 
further. Th e fi nancial exuberance of the last 2 decades had come to a sudden end. 
In one extraordinary weekend, Saturday and Sunday September 13 and 14, most of 
the nation’s leading bankers and senior government offi cials led by the Secretary of the 
Treasury Henry “Hank” Paulson tried to salvage the American economy. Although 
the government and the bankers failed to save Lehman Brothers, they avoided a far 
worse fate of massive bankruptcies and the coming of a second Great Depression. 
Nevertheless, they did not succeed in saving the thriving economy of the last 2 decades. 
The extent of the financial crisis of 2008 came as a surprise, even to Treasury 
Secretary Paulson, who had warned that a crisis was coming since becoming the top 
federal fi nancial offi cial in July 2006 and to Timothy Geithner, then the head of the 
New York Federal Reserve Bank. Th e size and complexity of the crisis that hit the 
country in 2008 was much more severe than they would have predicted. 
Th e economy had been growing rapidly since the early 1990s. Interest rates had 
remained low in part because of policies at the Federal Reserve Bank; in part because 
of the Clinton-era efforts to cut the size of the federal deficit; and in part because 
bankers and governments in Asia, especially China, were willing to make low-interest 
loans to Americans and European borrowers, particularly to fi nance their purchases 
of Asian goods. 
During the 1990s and later, because of policies fostered by the Clinton and 
Bush administrations, bankers got much more freedom from federal regulations 
than had been the case in any period since the Depression. In 1999, with bipartisan 
support, Congress passed the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act that repealed a section of the 
1933 Glass-Steagall Act. Glass-Steagall, which was passed at the height of the Great 
Depression, created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to provide 
federal insurance for bank accounts but also required that insured banks not use their 
money to speculate, that is, to make risky investments. For decades, insured banks 
provided mortgages to families that wanted to buy a home, usually up to 80 percent 
of the price of a house, so people could pay off their homes over a 20- to 30-year time 
span. Banks were cautious in making loans, insisting on detailed documentation of a 
family’s ability to pay back the loan. Most of the time, a bank that issued a mortgage 
continued to hold it until the loan was paid off . 
Investment banks, like Lehman Brothers and Goldman Sachs, were free to speculate 
on the stock market or in other investments, but they were not federally insured; 
they were risking their own money, not that of the taxpayers. What had been a hard 
and fast divide between investment and commercial banks in 1933 had been slowly 
eroding and, aft er 1999, had became a very porous wall. 
Two further developments changed the way banks operated and mortgages were 
issued in the United States. President George W. Bush talked of an “ownership society” 
in which Americans would be invested in their communities because they owned 
their own homes. Liberal Democrats like Massachusetts representative Barney Frank 
insisted that mortgages be available to allow poorer people to own their own homes.

At the same time, banks found new ways to handle—and profit from—home 
mortgages. Rather than issue a mortgage and then hold it, banks divided mortgages 
into small shares—“sliced and diced” them, as some said—and then sold the mortgage 
shares, at a profi t, to many diff erent banks and investors. As a result, banks could 
invest in pieces of many diff erent mortgages in ways that seemed to lower the risk 
of individual mortgage defaulting since investors held portions of many mortgages 
rather than the whole amount of a few. With interest rates low and mortgages easier 
than ever to sell to other banks, mortgage lenders also began issuing mortgages to 
people who never before would have been eligible. Th ey issued mortgages with no 
down payment and no required documentation of income or ability to pay in what 
became known as the “subprime mortgage market” and then sold these mortgages at 
a profi t. Th e institution that had issued the mortgage was not at risk if the person who 
took out the mortgage later defaulted because that institution had long since sold the 
mortgage, probably in pieces, to several diff erent investors. With such easy funding 
available, sellers found they could ask higher prices for homes, and housing prices 
climbed at an extraordinary rate. 
Between 2001 and 2006, housing prices kept rising, interest rates stayed low, and 
bankers made a lot of money. The investment bank Goldman Sachs generated an 
average income of $661,000 per employee in 2007. Goldman’s chief, Lloyd Blankfein, 
earned $54 million that year. Mortgages were no longer merely for primary residences 
but for investment. People bought houses as investments and then sold them 
for higher amounts, known as “fl ipping,” which enabled them to buy more expensive 
houses with the profi ts or simply pocket the money. Everyone seemed to be making 
money, and many argued that only fools were left out of the process. Th e situation was 
a classic bubble very much like every other bubble from the tulip bubble of the 1600s 
in Holland to the stock market bubble of 1929 to the dot.com bubble of the 1990s. 
In 2006, the housing bubble reached its peak. Housing prices stopped rising. 
People who had bought houses they could not aff ord and had planned to “fl ip” them, 
could not sell them. People who had bought homes with fl exible interest rates, thinking 
that they would refi nance for a lower rate later, could not fi nd a new mortgage. 
More people started defaulting on loans. As defaults grew, banks who held the mortgages 
started to get into trouble. Even if mortgages had been “sliced and diced,” banks 
that owned slices of mortgages that were in default were now, themselves, in trouble. 
Initially, most people thought the crisis would be limited to a few mortgage lenders 
who had taken too many risks. Th ey were wrong. 
Before long, it became clear that large and supposedly stable investment banks 
like Lehman and Goldman Sachs, which held portions of many sliced loans, were 
in a lot of trouble. Bankers who had taken risks throughout their 
careers, confi dent that there was always a way out, could not fi nd a 
way out of the crisis. Over the weekend of September 13–14, 2008, 
while Treasury Secretary Paulson was trying to maintain confi dence, 
he privately called his wife to share his worries. “What if the system 
collapses?” he asked. 
In the end, the nation’s fi nancial system did not collapse. But it 
did not resume the fi nancial health that had characterized most of the 
1990s and early 2000s. At the end of September, Secretary Paulson 
and congressional leaders put together Troubled Asset Relief Program 
(TARP) legislation that would stop the continuing fi nancial collapse. 
When TARP was put to a vote in the House of Representatives, 
in spite of the support of leaders of both parties, the bailout was 
rejected by a 228 to 205 vote by members of both parties who did 
not think it was the government’s business to use taxpayer money 
to bail out investors who had taken too many risks with their own 
funds. Immediately aft er the vote, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 
lost another 777 points, the biggest 1-day drop ever. Another report 
Infl ated housing prices and problems with home mortgages helped 
cause the fi nancial crisis of 2008. As a result, many people were evicted or 
forced to sell homes they could no longer aff ord, which produced a glut 
on the housing market and a signifi cant drop in home prices and values.

indicated that 159,000 jobs had been lost in September. Th e crisis was spreading far 
beyond the banks. As credit and confi dence dried up, people saw jobs, savings, and 
pensions disappear. Th e American economy seemed to be teetering badly. Finally on 
Friday October 3, under pressure from President Bush and from both major presidential 
candidates, Congress passed the TARP legislation. Th e law created a $700 billion 
fund to buy the worst of the troubled assets from the banks and stabilize the system. 
“We have shown the world that the United States will stabilize our fi nancial markets 
and maintain a leading role in the global economy,” Bush said. 
In May 2009, Congress created a Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission to study 
the crisis. Th e commission held a number of hearings. At one of them, in June 2010, 
the financier Warren Buffett was asked who was to blame. “[I]t’s a little bit like 
Cinderella at the ball,” Buff ett said. “People may have some feeling that at midnight 
it’s going to turn to pumpkin and mice, but it’s so darn much fun.…Th ere’s no villain.” 
Others thought there was some specifi c blame to be assigned. People blamed 
Lehman Brothers and other banks. Th ey blamed the auditing companies that should 
have looked more closely at the account books of the banks. Th ey blamed the repeal of 
Glass-Steagall. And many saw the crisis as one more in the sad long line of investment 
bubbles that, when they burst, hurt not only those caught up in the speculation but the 
economy of the whole nation and, indeed, of the world. Certainly the crisis could have 
been worse, and the work of the Treasury Secretary and the TARP legislation may 
have kept the country from another Great Depression. However, as Congressman 
Barney Frank said of Paulson’s eff orts, “You don’t get any credit for disaster averted.” 
Aft er 2008, unemployment rates stayed stubbornly high. In 2009 and 2010, the 
United States had an offi cial unemployment rate of 10 percent, and if one counted discouraged 
and part-time workers, it was closer to 16 percent. Th ose who lost their jobs 
were out of work for increasingly longer periods of time. High unemployment creates 
its own negative cycle. For the unemployed, it is devastating. When unemployed people 
do not buy cars, computers, and refrigerators, the whole economy slows down. As 
the nation entered the 2012 election cycle, economic movement was very slow. 
The crisis of 2008 also brought other economic problems to light. Firms like 
Lehman Brothers had been painting a rosier picture of their fi nances than the situation 
warranted, and others were engaged in much more corrupt practices. Th ree months 
aft er the collapse of Lehman Brothers, a New York fi nancier, Bernard Madoff , was 
arrested and charged with securities fraud. Madoff ’s Investment Securities Company 
was, in reality, a giant Ponzi scheme (see Chapter 21 for information on the fi rst such 
scheme by Charles Ponzi) . Madoff delivered grand returns on investments made with 
his company, but it turned out that Madoff simply used the funds that were invested 
with his company to pay out high returns on older funds. He did not invest, or even 
save them. As long as more money kept coming in, Madoff was able to keep up the 
illusion of amazing success, and investors were happy. When the nation’s fi nances 
seized up in the fall of 2008, Madoff was not able to keep the investments coming in, 
and without them, the payments could not keep going out, and the whole house of 
cards collapsed. Madoff was sentenced to 150 years in prison; investors lost between 
$10 and $17 billion. 
In May 2011, another highly regarded investor, Raj Rajaratnam, head of Galleon, 
a multibillion dollar hedge fund, or speculative investment group, was convicted of 14 
counts of securities fraud for bribing corporate employees to provide information that 
allowed Galleon to “guess” future stock values and make a fortune. By 2011, business 
leaders, and especially investors, were not highly regarded by a large segment of the 
American public. 
Business leaders were not the only ones held in low esteem, however. Government 
offi cials, both Democrats and Republicans, were distrusted. Why, people asked, did 
the government bailout banks and the auto industry? Why was so much taxpayer 
money needed to stabilize investment banks when bankers were still getting huge 
bonuses but unemployment stayed stubbornly high? Were the high offi cials in the

NEW LIBERALS, NEW CONSERVATIVES 
Analyze the most recent political developments in the United States. 
Barack Obama was elected as a U.S. Senator from Illinois, just as George W. Bush won 
a second term in 2004. From the day he entered the Senate, Obama was better known 
than most newcomers. His upset win in a 7-way Illinois Democratic primary and his 
keynote speech calling for a new “politics of hope” at the 2004 convention that nominated 
John Kerry, followed by his continuing telegenic appearance, his life story, and 
his ability to rally people, all led many to notice him. 
Nevertheless, he was a Senate freshman, and when the Majority Leader Harry Reid 
called him in for a meeting, Obama was surprised. As he headed toward the meeting, 
Obama told Robert Gibbs, his scheduler, “I wonder what we screwed up.” But 
Reid stunned the young senator. As Obama recounted the meeting to Gibbs, he said, 
“Harry wants me to run for president.…He really wants me to run for president.” 
Reid had certainly noticed Obama’s discomfort with the Senate’s slow pace, but 
more important, he had noticed the way Obama could connect with voters. Reid also 
had another reason to look carefully at Obama. The obvious front-runner for the 
Democratic nomination was Hillary Clinton: fi rst lady from 1993 to 2001 and, since 
2001, the U.S. Senator from New York. In the Senate, Clinton had established a solid 
track record. Reid liked her. Obama liked her. But a lot of Americans did not like her. 
Since her days as fi rst lady and leader of President Bill Clinton’s health care task force, 
Hillary Clinton had been a lightning rod for opposition to expanded government policies 
and, for some, for opposition to the role of women in politics. A lot of voters hated 
her. Like many Democrats, including Reid, she had voted to authorize the War in Iraq, 
and by 2006, it was becoming clear that, with the war going badly, such a vote was a terrible 
burden among liberal Democrats. Finally, for Reid and many of the Democratic 
Party’s senior leaders, the worst nightmare was the nomination of Hilary Clinton followed 
by some new revelation about her husband’s behavior like the Monica Lewinsky 
scandal that would end up bringing another Republican to the White House. They 
were desperate for another candidate, and in Obama they thought they had found one. 
The Unprecedented Election of 2008 
In modern American politics, being anointed by the party’s leaders is a far cry from 
being nominated. Running for high offi ce required Obama and the other candidates to 
slog through months of primary elections, including the Iowa caucuses and the New 
Hampshire primary in January, until the midsummer nominating convention. All 
along the way, voters are more than happy to overrule the party elite. 
Obama needed to decide whether he was going to run for president or not. David 
Plouff e, one of Obama’s inner circle of campaign leaders, warned him that he could 
stay in the Senate and enjoy weekends and vacations with his family or he could run 
for president, have every aspect of his life pried into, travel constantly, and “lead a 
lonely, miserable life.” Th ere was no middle ground. Obama needed time to talk it 
over with his wife Michelle. In the end, they were both in. Most people still considered 
it a long shot, but slowly, the long shot turned into reality.

In one of the fi rst steps toward seeking the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination, 
then Senator Obama visited Netscape founder Marc Andreessen (see Chapter 
29 ) and told him that he wanted to run the most sophisticated digital campaign on 
record. Andreessen was impressed that “the Senator was personally interested in the 
rise of social networking, Facebook, YouTube, and user-generated content.” Several 
veterans of the Dean campaign also signed on to help the new campaign, and with the 
help of the Internet, Obama was able to raise twice the funds of his main rival, Hillary 
Clinton, and go on to win the nomination in spite of a long and bruising race between 
Obama and Clinton that remained close through the end of the primary season. Only 
in June was it clear that Obama had won the nomination. 
It had been a historic contest. Hillary Clinton was the fi rst woman to come so close 
to the presidential nomination, and Barack Obama was the fi rst African-American to 
win. Perhaps, some thought, the nation was past the point where either gender or race 
mattered as they had in the past. Others insisted that gender and race were still very 
powerful forces, but in Clinton and Obama, the country had two extraordinary candidates 
who transcended the odds to accomplish what they did. 
The battle for the Republican nomination was almost as hard fought in 2008. 
President Bush could not run for a third term, and his popularity had sunk as a result 
of the war and fi nancial crisis. Arizona senator John McCain was the front-runner 
throughout the campaign. Although he had almost defeated Bush for the nomination 
in 2000 and was a war hero—having been a prisoner of war in Vietnam—McCain also 
had a hair-trigger temper and had divorced aft er having an aff air and then remarried. 
Th e 2006 midterm Republican losses probably strengthened McCain’s chances. 
McCain’s reputation as a moderate and an independent meant that he would not be 
tarred with all of Bush’s troubles. In spite of several primary challengers, McCain won 
key Republican primaries, and by March, it was clear he would be the Republican 
nominee for president. Th e only remaining question was who he would select to be his 
running mate. 
John McCain knew that his selection of a vice presidential candidate was especially 
important. Obama led in fund-raising and public opinion polls. McCain needed 
a game-changing move. McCain wanted Connecticut’s Democratic senator Joe 
Lieberman. Lieberman was a staunch Democrat and had served as Al Gore’s running 
mate in 2000, but he had broken with the majority of his own party on the war in 
Iraq, which he supported, and he was already campaigning for McCain. His selection 
would reinforce McCain’s credentials as an independent. But in the end, other 
Republicans convinced McCain that proposing a Democrat who, more important, 
was prochoice on the issue of abortion, would split the party. McCain rejected his 
friend Lieberman and selected the 44-year-old governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin. She 
was popular in Alaska and had all the credentials needed as a conservative Republican. 
Palin became a campaign sensation but her lack of familiarity with national politics, 
and her feuding with the McCain campaign staff probably hurt as much as it helped. 
When Obama asked Delaware senator Joseph Biden to be his running mate, the contrast 
between someone with decades of national experience and Alaska’s 20-month 
governor could not have been greater, even if Obama also had only served in the 
Senate for that amount of time. 
Th e September fi nancial crisis played to Obama’s strengths. McCain always said 
that economic issues were not his strong point, and when, aft er the Lehman bankruptcy 
he said, “The fundamentals of our economy are strong”—the same words 
Herbert Hoover had used at the height of the Great Depression—his advisors started 
to panic. In contrast, Obama had a comprehensive economic plan, and in the days 
aft er Lehman’s collapse, he spent his time learning from people like Bush’s Treasury 
Secretary Paulson and Federal Reserve chair Ben Bernanke, both of whom came to 
respect him. At the same time, the economy and the war in Iraq continued to hamper 
the Republicans. On Election Day, Obama defeated McCain by 53 percent to 46 percent 
of the vote, carrying 365 electoral votes to McCain’s 173 votes. Th e nation, which

had fought a civil war and witnessed a long civil rights movement over issues of race 
had just elected its fi rst African-American president. It was an historic moment. Now 
people were about to see what sort of change Barack Obama had been talking about. 
Obama’s Agenda—Stimulus and a Health Plan 
President-elect Obama asked his former opponent Hillary Clinton to serve as his secretary 
of state. She was reluctant to leave the independence of the Senate, but Obama 
pressed and Clinton took the job. Obama told Clinton, “Th e economy is a much bigger 
mess” than imagined, and he needed a very strong secretary of state to run foreign 
policy. He knew that while the bailout of the banks had been a fi rst step, much more 
needed to be done. Nevertheless, economic experts, political leaders, and average voters 
all disagreed sharply about what should be done. 
Obama was famous for his use of a Blackberry and an iPhone during his Senate 
career and his presidential campaign. Bemoaning the need to give up his iPhone for 
security reasons once elected president, Obama continued to use a Blackberry as well 
as his personal Twitter account, his MacBook Pro, and an iPad2. Th e world of high 
technology arrived in the White House in January 2009. 
Immediately on taking office in January 2009, Obama proposed the American 
Recovery and Reinvestment Act, and it passed within weeks. Th e act pumped money 
into the economy, providing funds for road improvements, railroads, and unemployment 
benefi ts. Th e Recovery and Reinvestment Act was standard economics, an eff ort 
to “prime the pump” and get the economy moving by spending funds so employment 
would rise, private spending would pick up, and the government could step back. 
Unfortunately for Obama, the emergency spending piled further debts on top of those 
already in place, and many began to worry about the cost. 
While the administration struggled with the economy, 
Obama also moved quickly to implement what he hoped would 
be his signature initiative: health care for all Americans. From 
Harry Truman on, every Democratic administration sought 
to implement health care reform , but every effort had failed. 
Obama wanted to be the Democrat who accomplished what others 
had failed. Aft er a long and bitter fi ght, he was able to sign the 
Patient Protection and Aff ordable Care Act on March 23, 2010. 
Unlike the stimulus legislation, however, health care was a long 
fi ght, fi lled with compromises. It dominated the Congress that 
came to offi ce with Obama. From the beginning the Republican 
minority was dedicated to defeating the measure. Th e Senate rule 
that a fi libuster could stop all legislation unless 60 Senators voted 
to close debate provided eff ective leverage for Republicans and 
Democrats. The Senate included only 60 Democrats, so every 
one of them could demand special consideration and exemptions, 
and many did, before the fi nal vote. Th e result was that 
the historic health care legislation passed only aft er a political 
process that discouraged almost everyone. Th e new law required 
every American to have health insurance; prohibited insurance 
companies from excluding anyone, including those with preexisting 
conditions; provided government subsidies for those who 
have trouble buying insurance; and penalized employers not 
off ering health insurance. A number of state attorneys general 
challenged the legislation in court, but in the spring of 2012, the 
U.S. Supreme Court in a split decision upheld the law. Surprising 
its supporters, the law ended up being a political liability for a 
Democratic president and his party in the midterm elections of 
2010 and the presidential election of 2012.

States—a time of celebration for many.

944 Part IX Certainty, Uncertainty, and New Beginnings, 1980–To The Present 
The Rise of the Tea Party, Occupy Wall Street, and Divided 
Government 
In part because of anger at the health care legislation, in part because of fears about the 
growing national debt, and in part because of a long-standing bias among Americans 
against big government, the huge plurality with which Obama came to offi ce started to 
evaporate rapidly. 
On January 19, 2010, just a year aft er Obama’s inauguration, the growing voter anger 
became apparent to the nation, particularly aft er one of the icons of American liberalism, 
Massachusetts senator Edward M. Kennedy, died of a brain tumor in August 2009. 
Kennedy had served in the U.S. Senate since 1962, the fourth-longest Senate career in 
U.S. history. A special election was called to fi ll Kennedy’s unexpired term, and almost 
everyone assumed that whoever received the Democratic nomination would get the 
job. But a little known Republican state senator, Scott Brown, campaigned hard, telling 
people, “It’s not Kennedy’s seat…it’s the people’s seat,” and promising to be the crucial 
40th vote to sustain a fi libuster in the Senate against the health care legislation. Brown 
won easily, telling his cheering supporters on election night, “What I’ve heard again 
and again on the campaign trail is that our political leaders have grown aloof from 
the people, impatient with dissent, and comfortable in the back room making deals.” 
Although Brown was not able to stop the passage of the health care law, his election was 
a sign that something was shift ing in American politics. It was not the fi rst such sign. 
Only weeks after Obama’s inauguration, protests were springing up in many 
different places. In Seattle, a 29-year-old woman, Keli Carender, organized a small 
protest rally about “the spending,” whether it was Bush’s TARP or Obama’s stimulus. 
Carender told a small crowd that “I started thinking, what are we getting ourselves into? 
It didn’t make sense to me to be spending all this money when we don’t have it.” Th en, 
a little while later, on February 19, 2009, a fi nancial news commentator, Rick Santelli, 
said that Obama’s stimulus eff orts were “promoting bad behavior” if they bailed out 
“the losers” who had taken out larger mortgages than they could aff ord. Santelli said, 
“We’re thinking of having a Chicago Tea Party in July.” And the name took hold. 
In September 2010, between 70,000 and 90,000 demonstrators converged on the 
Mall in Washington, DC, to protest the health care legislation and government spending. 
Some wore tricolor hats to symbolize their link to the original Boston Tea Party. 
Some carried signs that said, “Th ank you, Glenn Beck!” referring to the conservative 
television commentator who railed against the Obama administration. Some, alluding to 
fears that the health care legislation would limit treatments, carried signs that said, “Pull 
the plug on Obama, not Grandma.” Th e National Tea Party Coalition tried to coordinate 
eff orts. Th e Republican vice presidential nominee from 2008, Sarah Palin, adopted the 
Tea Party Platform and spoke at its rallies. Nevertheless, the movement was distrustful 
of self-proclaimed leaders. Diff erent groups in diff erent places did as they pleased. Tea 
Party candidates challenged Republicans in primary elections all through 2009 and 2010 
and sometimes defeated long-standing Republican moderates. In November 2010, with 
solid Tea Party support, Republicans took control of the House of Representatives and 
made gains in the Senate. But the Tea Party candidates were of a diff erent sort than the 
older Republicans, not only more conservative but also far less willing to compromise. 
Th e Tea Party was fueled by fear about the debt, uncertainty about the economy, 
and anger at big institutions, most of all the federal government but also corporations 
and universities. Many in the Tea Party argued that the federal government should 
do no more than what was specifi cally authorized in the Constitution, and almost all 
of its members were generally distrustful of government programs, especially those 
coming from the federal government and those designed to help the poor or minority 
groups. It quickly became clear that the Tea Party was not going away, even though its 
membership might be fi lled with internal contradictions. Tea Party members disliked 
government but wanted their Social Security checks to arrive on time; they hated the 
new health care but loved their Medicare cards. When the outgoing Congress repealed

the “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” ban on gay and lesbian personnel serving in the military 
in late 2010, the Tea Party was divided about its response; neither the Tea Party nor 
the Republicans made it a major issue. Still, the Tea Party, with its focus on economic 
issues and anger at big government was a powerful group. 
In the summer of 2011, the new Tea Party-fueled Republican majority in the House 
of Representatives brought the country to the brink of fi nancial default as they refused 
until the last minute to raise the nation’s borrowing capacity. Standard & Poor’s, one of 
the nation’s leading auditing agencies, lowered the U.S. credit rating for the fi rst time 
in history because of the government’s seeming inability to deal with the federal debt. 
As if in response to the Tea Party, a new movement of students and other young 
people also emerged to protest conditions in the country. While the Tea Party took 
a conservative stance on economic issues, Occupy Wall Street was closer to the left 
on most issues. In September 2011, a group of young people held a rally near Wall 
Street in Lower Manhattan and then moved into nearby Zuccotti Park where they 
set up tents, a library, a communications center, and a kitchen, and planned to stay. 
A Canadian publication, Adbusters, had been calling for just such a move, and by 
late September it was a reality. Th e rallying cry of Occupy Wall Street was “We are 
the 99%” to diff erentiate themselves from the richest 1 percent, including the bankers 
who surrounded them in Lower Manhattan. Although those gathering in protest 
consistently refused to issue a manifesto or platform, Occupy was an angry response 
to the fi nancial crisis and the growing gap between rich and poor in the country. Th ey 
condemned the huge level of college debt that many young people were carrying and 
the diffi culties for a new generation in getting jobs. 
Before long, Occupy movements were springing up all around the country—
Occupy Los Angeles, Occupy Oakland, Occupy Denver, Occupy Boston, and 
Occupy Rochester. In November, some 3 months aft er the encampment at Zuccotti 
Park began, New York police, on orders from the mayor, cleared the park. Mayors 
and police departments in other cities had generally acted sooner. Nevertheless, the 
Occupy movement was far from over. Th rough the winter and the following year, 
Occupy held rallies, meetings, and planning sessions. Neither Occupy nor the Tea 
Party was going to go away, and both would be forces to deal with. Governing a nation 
so deeply divided was going to be diffi cult. Th e terms of the 2012 election were set. 
Occupy Wall Street 
A protest group that protested the rising 
level of student debt, the lack of job opportunities, 
and the fact that the economy seemed 
stacked in favor of the rich. 
The Tea Party movement named itself after those who had dumped tea in Boston harbor in 1773 rather 
than pay a tax on it. Many in the modern movement shared the anti-tax, anti-government sentiments of the 
earlier Tea Party while some dressed the part.

On June 26, 2013, in a 5-4 opinion in the case of United States 
v. Windsor , the United States Supreme Court declared a 
significant part of the Defense of Marriage Act unconstitutional. 
Writing for the majority, Justice Anthony Kennedy said: 
DOMA’s principal effect is to identify a subset of state-sanctioned 
marriages and make them unequal.…By this dynamic 
DOMA undermines both the public and private significance 
of state-sanctioned same-sex marriages; for it tells those couples, 
and all the world, that their otherwise valid marriages are 
unworthy of federal recognition. This places same-sex couples 
in an unstable position of being in a second-tier marriage. 
The decision was not without debate. Four justices opposed the 
majority. Writing for the minority, Justice Antonin Scalia said 
that the court should never have taken on the case and, further, 
that the decision would lead inevitably to the Supreme Court’s 
declaring all state laws against gay marriage to be invalid. 
Nevertheless, the majority opinion became the law of the 
land and, as a result, same-sex couples married in the 13 states, 
the District of Columbia, and under the five Native American 
tribal governments that approved same-sex marriage were provided 
all the benefits—including tax advantages, pension, and 
visitation rights—that all other married couples had. It was a 
major change and one that came very quickly. 
When the Congress passed and President Bill Clinton signed 
the Defense of Marriage Act in September 1996, no state recognized 
same-sex marriage. Before the 1996 legislation, Congress 
had left decisions about what constituted a legitimate marriage 
to the states. But fearing the potential of same-sex marriage, the 
Republican Congress passed the Defense of Marriage Act and 
the Democratic President signed it. As a result, federal law said 
that no matter what a state did, in the eyes of the federal government 
(for federal income tax, for federal pensions, for benefits 
for spouses of government employees and armed forces 
personnel and many related matters) a state-sanctioned samesex 
marriage was invalid. 
Nevertheless, as some feared and others hoped, states 
started to act on their own. In 2003, the Massachusetts Supreme 
Judicial Court declared that state laws prohibiting same-sex 
marriage were invalid in that state and gay and lesbian couples 
began getting married there. State courts in other states, 
including California, Connecticut, and Iowa, issued similar rulings. 
Then in 2009, the Vermont legislature sanctioned same-sex 
marriage, New York followed in 2011, and in 2012 Washington, 
Maine, and Maryland passed similar laws. 
THINKING HISTORICALLY 
Same-Sex Marriage 
Activists Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin became the fi rst same-sex couple to 
be married in San Francisco on February 12, 2004. In June 2013, the United 
States Supreme Court said that same-sex couples could not be denied federal 
marriage benefi ts. 
Same-sex marriages, illegal in every part of the United States in 
the 1990s, were recognized in 2013 by states comprising 30 percent 
of the American population and by the federal government. 
Opinion polls indicated that the majority of the American people 
agreed with the new policies. It was a rapid and dramatic change 
in American culture. 
Thinking Critically 
1. Comparison 
How would you compare the political mood in the United 
States when the Defense of Marriage Act was passed in 1996 
and when it was declared unconstitutional in 2013? 
2. Contextualization 
What other developments in American culture and political 
debate might help explain decisions like those of the 
Massachusetts Supreme Court, the Vermont legislature or in 
2013 the U.S. Supreme Court? How much does context impact 
such decisions?

and underscores the realignments of Republican red states and Democratic blue states. 
The Election of 2012 
As President Obama and the Democrats looked to the 2012 election, they did so with 
considerable optimism. Th e worst of the fi nancial crisis was past, and the wars in Iraq and 
Afghanistan were at least winding down. At the same time, the president and his party 
were aware of some signifi cant liabilities. Th e economy remained far from robust, the 
health care law—which some called Obamacare— remained unpopular, especially among 
people who resented all forms of government intrusion in their lives. Many of those who 
had voted for the fi rst time in 2008 to support Obama were disillusioned with the slow 
pace of change and might well not bother to vote in 2012. It was going to be a close contest. 
Th e battle for the Republican nomination was a long one. In the early stages, many 
wondered whether 2008 vice presidential nominee and Tea Party darling Sarah Palin 
would enter the race, but she never did. Once the contest for the Republican nomination 
got under way, former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, who had been a 
serious contender for the 2008 nomination, was always a front-runner. But many in 
the Republican Party thought Romney was too liberal, and a number of other candidates, 
including former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty, former speaker Newt 
Gingrich, businessman Herman Cann, and Representative Michele Bachmann, gave 
Romney a strong challenge. In the end, Romney won the nomination and asked 
Congressman Paul Ryan, who had earned his conservative credentials with a series of 
tax cutting proposals, to be his running mate. 
In the fall election, Obama was generally considered to be the front-runner, but 
many thought the race was too close to call. In the fi rst presidential debate, Obama 
performed poorly—seeming disinterested—and Romney surged. In the later debates, 
however, Obama came on strong. One of Romney’s great strengths, his years of 
business experience, came to hurt him as Democrats exploited the numbers of layoff 
s that had taken place in Romney-owned companies. Late in the campaign, a private 
conversation in which Romney had told a group of supporters that 47 percent 
of the electorate would never support him because they were “dependent on the 
government” angered many. On election day, Obama won by a solid 51 percent to 
47 percent majority and carried 332 electoral votes to Romney’s 206 (see Map 30-2).

948 Part IX Certainty, Uncertainty, and New Beginnings, 1980–To The Present 
Th e Congress, however, remained divided, with Democrats having a majority in the 
Senate and Republicans in the House. 
At his second inauguration in January 2013, on what was Martin Luther King, Jr.’s, 
birthday, President Obama laid out the themes that he said would be most important in 
his second term. Appealing to some important moments in American history, he said, 
“We, the people, declare today that the most evident of truths—that all of us are created 
equal—is the star that guides us still; just as it guided our forebears through Seneca Falls, 
and Selma, and Stonewall …” and then appealing to King’s memory he added, “Our 
individual freedom is inextricably bound to the freedom of every soul on Earth.” 
And he continued: 
It is now our generation’s task to carry on what those pioneers began. For our 
journey is not complete until our wives, our mothers and daughters can earn a 
living equal to their eff orts. Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers 
and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law for if we are truly created 
equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well. Our 
journey is not complete until no citizen is forced to wait for hours to exercise the 
right to vote. Our journey is not complete until we fi nd a better way to welcome 
the striving, hopeful immigrants who still see America as a land of opportunity— 
until bright young students and engineers are enlisted in our workforce rather 
than expelled from our country. Our journey is not complete until all our children, 
from the streets of Detroit to the hills of Appalachia, to the quiet lanes of 
Newtown, know that they are cared for and cherished and always safe from harm. 
His address was not a set of policy recommendations but, rather, a way of carving out 
a vision. 
Former Speaker Newt Gingrich, who had contested the Republican nomination, said 
of Obama’s speech that he “approved of 80 percent of President Barack Obama’s inaugural 
address”; however, “the rest,” Gingrich said, “was goofy left -wingism.” Deciding where 
any consensus might be found would be more diffi cult than Gingrich’s response might 
imply. Soon aft er the inauguration, Obama said he would use executive authority to institute 
action on climate change and quickly issued tough new limitations on emissions. Th e 
president had promised as much in his inaugural address, which had led Gingrich to say, 
“Th e whole section about climate change is nonsense.” Th e divides on that issue, as on

so many issues that had split the Congress and the country during Obama’s fi rst term, 
seem destined to continue for the foreseeable future. Many spoke of their desire for greater 
national unity and good will, but it remained an illusive goal. 
Quick Review How have domestic issues contributed to divisions in the government and 
the country since 2008? 
CONCLUSION 
George W. Bush, in the fi rst year of his presidency, achieved two major domestic policy 
goals: education reform and tax reform. But September 11, 2001, permanently shift ed 
the focus of the Bush administration from domestic problems to international terrorism. 
Henceforth, the war on terror would dominate his presidency and remain a key 
issue for his successor in offi ce, Barack Obama. 
In the days aft er the September 11 attacks, it became clear that al-Qaeda and its 
leader, Osama bin Laden, were responsible. Th e Bush administration immediately 
developed a strategy to punish not only the direct perpetrators but also those who 
harbored them. When it was determined that the Taliban government of Afghanistan 
was protecting bin Laden and al-Qaeda, U.S. ground forces invaded the country 
and quickly overthrew the Taliban regime. Although the United States had forced 
a change in government in Afghanistan and had killed or captured many al-Qaeda 
operatives, both bin Laden and his chief lieutenant had escaped into Pakistan. It took 
another 10 years to fi nd bin Laden, but Taliban insurgents continued to engage the 
U.S. military and destabilize Afghanistan and other parts of the world. 
While the United States waged war in Afghanistan, the Bush administration turned 
its attention to Iraq. Despite the fact that neither the CIA nor the UN Nations found 
compelling evidence that Iraq was connected to the September 11 attacks, many in 
the administration favored U.S. military intervention. Ultimately, the United States 
and Great Britain obtained UN and congressional approval for an invasion, based 
on alleged Iraqi possession of weapons of mass destruction. Major combat operations 
in Iraq ended quickly, but the United States was ill prepared to serve as an occupying 
force. U.S. troops lacked clearly defi ned military objectives, and Iraq quickly 
descended into civil war. By 2004, public opinion was turning against the war. U.S. 
casualties were high, Iraq was in chaos, and no weapons of mass destruction had been 
found. Still, the U.S. mission in Iraq continued until December 2011. 
From 2005 until 2008, domestic problems also plagued the Bush administration. In 
2005, the federal response to Hurricane Katrina was wholly inadequate, and the U.S. economy 
was, in 2008, in a deep recession. Th e 2008 presidential election took place against this 
backdrop and culminated in the election of the nation’s fi rst African-American president, 
Barack Obama. Obama moved quickly to address the fi nancial crisis, but while the economy 
was stabilized, unemployment remained high. Th e Obama administration’s highest priority 
was to get Congress to approve a federal health insurance system which was signed into law 
in 2010. In the midst of a very slow recovery in which ordinary Americans suff ered greatly, 
new protests including the Tea Party and the Occupy movements emerged to express voter 
dissatisfaction with continual war and with the economic meltdown. By the time of the 2012 
presidential election, the nation was more divided than it had been in decades. Nevertheless, 
many liberal Americans celebrated when Obama won a second term in November 2012 
and when in June 2013 the U.S. Supreme Court declared portions of the federal Defense of 
Marriage Act to be unconstitutional, giving people in a same-sex marriage the same federal 
rights as other married people. Still, the nation entered Obama’s second term deeply divided 
on social and economic issues, and lasting resolutions seemed hard to fi nd.

THE IMPACT OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 
Analyze the impact of 9/11 on the nation and presidency of 
George Bush and the impact of Bush administration policies. 
Summary 
Th e terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the worst attack on 
the United States in American history, led to profound changes 
in the federal government and in the United States’ foreign policy. 
In the immediate aft ermath of the attacks, President Bush 
called for a global war on terror and identifi ed Afghanistan as 
the war’s fi rst important battlefi eld. Afghanistan’s Taliban government 
was quickly toppled, but the early gains there would 
prove largely illusory. President Bush had entered offi ce intent 
on focusing on domestic issues, and he succeeded in securing 
two of his most important domestic goals, across the board tax 
cuts and changes in federal education policy. Nonetheless, in 
the aft ermath of 9/11, foreign policy issues dominated his presidency. 
Bush’s war on terror involved both domestic and overseas 
components. At home, the PATRIOT Act expanded the powers 
and authority of the Department of Justice, many claimed 
at the expense of civil liberties. Overseas, the Bush administration 
came to the conclusion that the next major target of the war 
on terror should be Iraq and the regime of Saddam Hussein. 
Ignoring critics who pointed out the dangers involved in invading 
Iraq and who cast doubt on the administration’s justifi cations 
for the war, the Bush administration secured the approval 
of Congress and the UN and proceeded to invade Iraq. As was 
the case in Afghanistan, the existing regime was quickly toppled, 
but securing the peace proved far more diffi cult than the administration 
had predicted. Poor planning by the administration 
and insuffi cient American troops contributed to Iraq’s spiral into 
chaos and civil war. Revelations about conditions in Abu Ghraib 
prison damaged U.S. credibility around the world, and by 2004, 
American public opinion was turning against the war. Despite 
the fact that Bush secured a second term in the 2004 presidential 
election, opposition to the war continued to mount, and 
Republican defeats in the 2006 midterm elections signaled trouble 
ahead for the Republicans in the 2008 presidential election. 
Review Questions 
1. Cause and Eff ect 
What changes in the federal government and American foreign 
policy of the United States followed in the wake of the 
attacks of September 11, 2001? 
2. Comparison 
Compare and contrast the war on terror with earlier, more 
conventional American wars. What special challenges did 
the war on terror present? 
3. Construct an Argument 
In your opinion, how will President Bush’s decision to 
invade Iraq be viewed by future historians? 
Preparing to Write: Create a Timeline 
It is oft en helpful to establish a time line of critical events when 
seeking to understand complicated political and diplomatic 
developments. With this point in mind, create a time line of 
key events in American foreign policy from the attacks of 
September 11, 2001, to 2006. 
HURRICANE KATRINA AND ITS AFTERMATH 
30.2 
Explain the impact of Hurricane Katrina on the Gulf Coast. 
Summary 
Hurricane Katrina was a natural disaster compounded by 
human failure. Disasters in the past pointed to the danger hurricanes 
posed to the city. Over the course of the 1900s, river 
management decisions by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 
increased the danger, as did the tapping of underground oil and 
gas reserves in the Mississippi Delta. Moreover, in the days leading 
up to the hurricane, state and local offi cials failed to take 
steps that could have saved many lives. Th e storm devastated 
the entire Gulf Coast, but in the storm’s aft ermath, it became 
clear that the worse scenes of suff ering and death were in New 
Orleans’ poor black communities. Failures and delays on the 
part of the New Orleans Police Department and the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) compounded the 
suff ering. 
Review Questions 
4. Cause and Eff ect

most adversely aff ected by the storm? 
Preparing to Write: Using Evidence 
Choosing just the right piece of evidence is critical to creating 
a strong argument. With this point in mind, reread the excerpt 
from Mary Gehman’s account of Hurricane Katrina (see An

THE FINANCIAL CRISIS OF 2008 
30.3 
Explain the costs and consequences of the 2008 fi nancial 
crisis. 
Summary 
The financial crisis that hit in 2008 resulted from two related 
developments. First, deregulation broke down the divide between 
investment and commercial banks, allowed fi nancial institutions 
to become more closely interconnected, and encouraged such 
institutions to take greater risks. Second, fi nancial institutions 
changed the way they issued and invested in home mortgages, 
changes that encouraged the growth of a housing bubble, at the 
same time that they tied the health of the U.S. fi nancial system to 
rising home prices. As a result, when the housing bubble burst, it 
threatened to plunge the country into depression. In the end, the 
intervention of the federal government prevented the complete 
collapse of nation’s fi nancial system. Nonetheless, the economy 
did not resume the fi nancial health that had characterized most 
of the 1990s and early 2000s. Recovery was slow in coming and 
unemployment rates stayed high.

Preparing to Write: Write a Thesis 
A strong thesis statement that clearly articulates a central argument 
is the foundation of any essay. With this point in mind, 
review the discussion of the adoption of the 2008 fi nancial crisis 
included in the chapter. When you are fi nished, write a thesis 
statement for an essay assessing which groups and institutions 
bore primary responsibility for the crisis. 
NEW LIBERALS, NEW CONSERVATIVES 
30.4 
Analyze the most recent political developments in the United 
States. 
Summary 
In 2006, with the encouragement of senior Democratic offi - 
cials, Barrack Obama made the decision to challenge Hillary 
Clinton for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination. 
Obama emerged victorious after a hard-fought primary 
campaign that did not wrap up until June. Th e Republicans 
nominated John McCain. Trailing in fund-raising and public 
opinion, McCain selected Sarah Palin as his running mate in 
an eff ort to shake up the race and to energize his conservative 
base. Th e performance of the two candidates during the 
September fi nancial crisis convinced many voters that Obama 
was the right person to solve the country’s economic problems, 
and Obama won a clear victory in November. Despite 
the passage of stimulus legislation, the economy continued 
to struggle during Obama’s fi rst term. Passage of the Patient 
Protection and Affordable Care Act was a major legislative 
accomplishment, but it did not help Obama’s public approval 
ratings. Anger within the conservative wing of the Republican 
Party led to the emergence of the Tea Party, a loose coalition 
of irate, disaff ected, and highly conservative voters. Th e Tea 
Party was fueled by fear about the debt, uncertainty about the 
economy, and anger at big institutions, most of all the federal 
government but also corporations and universities. Th e 
Tea Party played a central role in the 2010 midterm elections 
and secured the election of a conservative, uncompromising, 
Republican majority in the House of Representatives. On the 
other end of the political spectrum, participants in the Occupy 
Wall Street movement focused their anger on growing income 
inequality. As the 2012 election neared, many believed that 
conditions were ripe for the Republicans to retake the White 
House. Despite conservative misgivings, the Republicans 
nominated former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney. 
Romney’s weakness as a candidate and a strong showing by 
Obama’s supporters combined to seal Obama’s reelection. Th e 
following June, liberals again cheered when the U.S. Supreme 
Court declared that residents of the 13 states that allowed 
same-sex marriage could have the same federal rights as all 
other married couples. 
Review Questions

Questions 9.1–9.3 refer the following document. 
[N]ew technologies compete with old ones—for time, for 
attention, for money, for prestige, but mostly for dominance 
of their world-view. . . . In the United States, we can see such 
collisions everywhere—in politics, in religion, in commerce—but 
we see them most clearly in the schools. . . . 
In introducing the personal computer to the classroom, we shall be 
breaking a four-hundred-year-old truce between the gregariousness 
and openness fostered by orality and the introspection and 
isolation fostered by the printed word. . . . Over four centuries, 
teachers, while emphasizing print, have allowed orality its place in 
the classroom, and have therefore achieved a kind of pedagogical 
peace between these two forms of learning, so that what is valuable 
in each can be maximized. Now comes the computer, carrying 
anew the banner of private learning and individual problemsolving. 
Will the widespread use of computers in the classroom 
defeat once and for all the claims of communal speech? Will the 
computer raise egocentrism to the status of a virtue? 
A new technology does not add or subtract something. It changes 
everything. In the year 1500, fi ft y years aft er the printing press was 
invented, we did not have old Europe plus the printing press. We 
had a diff erent Europe. . . . And that is why the competition among 
media is so fi erce. Surrounding every technology are institutions 
whose organization—not to mention their reason for being—refl ects 
the world-view promoted by the technology. Th erefore, when an old 
technology is assaulted by a new one, institutions are threatened. 
When institutions are threatened, a culture fi nds itself in crisis. Th is 
is serious business, which is why we learn nothing when educators 
ask, Will students learn mathematics better by computers than 
by textbooks? . . . Th ey direct our attention away from the serious 
social, intellectual, and institutional crisis that new media foster. . . . 
—Neil Postman, Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to 
Technology, 1993 
9.1 In this text, Neil Postman argues that 
a. technology determines the worldview of a culture— 
priorities, symbols, and even how humans relate to one 
another. 
b. computers will soon take over the classroom and 
eliminate the need for teachers. 
c. computers will have the eff ect of keeping people from 
reading great books and going to museums. 
d. computers and related technology have damaged our 
culture irreparably by diminishing person-to-person 
contact. 
9.2 Choose which of the following Neil Postman means by 
the phrase: “In introducing the personal computer to the 
classroom, we shall be breaking a four-hundred-year-old 
truce between the gregariousness and openness fostered 
by orality and the introspection and isolation fostered by 
the printed word. . . .” 
a. Personal computers should not be introduced into 
schools because to do so would break a “four-hundredyear-
old truce.” 
b. Just as the printing press changed education, computers 
will change the classroom fundamentally, in ways that 
no one can possibly anticipate. 
c. Personal computers in the classroom have the potential 
to make the teacher obsolete because students will no 
longer need teachers, individually or collectively. 
d. Th e use of computers in classes will enrich the 
classroom by giving students more opportunity to 
practice their language skills. 
9.3 Computer technology has changed drastically since 1993 
when Neil Postman wrote that passage. Which changes 
would you say are the most signifi cant in terms of 
Postman’s concerns at that time? 
a. Personal computers are much smaller than they were in 
1993. 
b. Personal computers are easier to repair than they were 
in 1993. 
c. Th e World Wide Web is freely available on personal 
computers. 
d. Computer games are much more sophisticated than 
games such as Pong that were still played in 1993. 
Questions 9.4–9.6 refer to the following document. 
House contests are traditionally local. In the 1994 campaign, 
however, 337 Republican candidates endorsed a common 
platform in a dramatic ceremony on the Capitol steps. 
As Republican Members of the House of Representatives and as

Questions 9.7–9.9 refer to the following document. 
Considered in its entirety, the Tea Party is neither a top-down creation 
nor a bottom-up explosion. Th is remarkable political outpouring 
is best understood as a combination of three intertwined forces. 
Each force is important in its own right, and their interaction is what 
gives the Tea Party its dynamism, drama, and wallop. Grassroots 
activism is certainly a key force, energized by angry, conservativeminded 
citizens who have formed vital local and regional groups. 
Another force is the panoply of national funders and ultra-freemarket 
advocacy groups that seek to highlight and leverage grassroots 
eff orts to further their long-term goal of remaking the Republican 
Party, pushing it towards the hard right on matters of taxation, public 
spending, and government regulation. Finally, the Tea Party cannot 
be understood without recognizing the mobilization provided by conservative 
media hosts who openly espouse and encourage the cause. 
From Fox News to right-wing radio jocks and bloggers, media impresarios 
have done a lot to create a sense of shared identity that lets 
otherwise scattered Tea Parties get together and feel part of something 
big and powerful. Media hosts also put out a steady diet of information 
and misinformation—including highly emotional claims—that 
keep Tea Party people in a constant state of anger and fear about the 
direction of the country and the doings of government offi cials. 
—Theda Skocpol and Vanessa Williamson, The Tea Party and 
the Remaking of Republican Conservatism, 2013 
9.7 What do authors Skocpol and Williamson mean when 
they say, “Th e Tea Party is neither a top-down creation, 
nor a bottom-up explosion”? 
a. Th e Tea Party members are not just poor people; in 
fact, some members are quite affl uent. 
b. Th e Tea Party did not “burst on the scene,” but actually 
has a long history going back many decades. 
c. Th e Tea Party has sincere grassroots activists, but much 
of the money that funds its activities comes from very 
wealthy conservative sources. 
d. Tea Party members are seriously confused about their 
own origins. 
9.8 According to the authors, what important role do 
conservative talk radio hosts play in the Tea Party? 
a. Th ey have contributed the bulk of the money to fund 
the activities. 
b. Th ey have accused the Tea Party of not being 
conservative enough. 
c. Th e role of the talk show hosts on conservative politics 
is greatly exaggerated. 
d. Th ey encourage the Tea Party members ideologically 
and help the Tea Party members feel that they are an 
important part of an important movement. 
9.9 What would you say characterizes the point of view of the 
authors? 
a. Th ey are members of the Tea Party and have written 
this book to justify their beliefs. 
b. Th e authors are social scientists using political science 
methodology to analyze the movement. 
c. Th e authors resent the infl uence of the Tea Party 
because members of the movement are generally not as 
well educated as the authors. 
d. Th e authors are libertarians who like that aspect of the 
Tea Party, but not the rest of what the group stands for. 
5. Th e American Dream Restoration Act: A $500 per child 
tax credit, begin repeal of the marriage tax penalty. . . . 
6. Th e National Security Restoration Act: No U.S. troops 
under U.N. command and restoration of the essential parts 
of our national security funding. . . . 
7. Th e Senior Citizens Fairness Act: Raise the Social 
Security earnings limit, . . . repeal the 1993 tax hikes on 
Social Security benefi ts and provide tax incentives for 
private long-term care insurance. . . . 
8. Th e Job Creation and Wage Enhancement Act: Small 
business incentives, capital gains cut and indexation, 
neutral cost recovery, . . . and unfunded mandate reform 
to create jobs and raise worker wages. 
9. Th e Common Sense Legal Reform Act: “Loser pays” laws. . . . 
10. Th e Citizen Legislature Act: A fi rst-ever vote on term limits. . . . 
— Republican Contract with America, 1994 
9.4 Which of these statements about the Contract for America 
is true?

Great Society programs, particularly those that had 
expanded welfare and that had tried to deal with crime 
using social programs. 
c. Th e draft ers of the Contract thought that the previous 
Congresses had placed too much emphasis on “family 
values” at the expense of more substantive legislation. 
d. Th e draft ers of the Contract wanted to restore the UN 
as the international peacekeeper of the world, with U.S. 
support. 
9.5 Which phrase best describes the signifi cance of the 
Contract for America? 
a. Th e Contract provided a unifi ed, national message

aft er the Contract for America was widely published? 
a. Th e Contract had no discernable eff ect on the elections of 
1994 and the actions of the subsequent 104th Congress. 
b. Although Republicans picked up a substantial majority, 
the fi rst in forty years, most of the legislation proposed 
in the Contract for America failed to be passed. 
c. Th e term limits introduced in the Contract for America 
dramatically changed the workings of the House as well 
as its future composition. 
d. Th e 104th Congress fi led articles of impeachment 
against President Clinton because he had opposed the 
Contract for America. 

954 Part IX Certainty, Uncertainty, and New Beginnings, 1980–To The Present 
c. Th e bill meant a great reduction in the power of the 
Department of Education, which Bush hoped to put 
in the best light, since it would be unpopular with his 
conservative base. 
d. Th e president wanted to appeal to African-Americans, 
who had been key to his having won the 2000 election.

publicity in staging their signings of bills. Which of the 
following did President George W. Bush hope to convey in 
this photo of a bill signing? 
a. In spite of the highly partisan split around his election, 
two of the most liberal Democratic members of 
Congress, Massachusetts Senator Edward M. Kennedy

Section II: Short Answer Questions 
Question 9.13 refers to the following two quotations. 
Passage 1 
Th e “one big thing” Reagan knew was the power and value of 
human freedom, which proved to be the defi ning principle of his 
worldview. It guided what he thought about domestic politics 
and was central to his vision for the world. For more than thirty 
years, Reagan embraced a vision for dealing with the Soviet 
Union and ending the Cold War that was remarkably consistent 
and proved to be decisive. People who note his apparent lack of 
interest in the details of diplomacy, missile throw weights, and 
international law fail to see his larger strategic vision. Details 
that animate so many in the word of politics, academe, and 
journalism did not interest him so much as the “metaphysics” of 
the Cold War. 
—Peter Schweizer, Reagan’s War, 2003 
Passage 2 
But collapse was not inevitable in the 1980s. . . . Structural 
contexts infl uenced decisions taken by individuals such as 
Gorbachev. Economic decline, technological backwardness, 
and modernization pressures shaped the preferences of the 
decision-makers who initiated institutional reform in the 
Soviet Union. Most basically, Gorbachev had to perceive 
problems in the system before setting out to address them 
through reform. 
Nonetheless, it was decisions taken by Gorbachev and other 
Soviet leaders that started the process of institutional change. 
A diff erent leader at the top taking diff erent decisions might 
have produced a diff erent reform trajectory or no reform at 
all. Gorbachev opened the range of the possible, allowing other 
forces in Soviet society to emerge and then articulate alternate 
models for organizing the federation, the polity, and the 
economy. 
—Michael McFaul, Russia’s Unfi nished Revolution, 2002 
9.13 Based on the two interpretations above of the collapse of 
the Soviet Union, complete the following three tasks: 
a. Briefl y explain the main point made by Passage 1. 
b. Briefl y explain the main point made by Passage 2. 
c. Provide ONE piece of evidence from the late 1990s or

eff ect until an election of Representatives shall have intervened. 
12 James Madison proposed this amendment in 1789 together with the ten amendments that 
were adopted as the Bill of Rights, but it failed to win ratifi cation at the time. Congress, however, 
had set no deadline for its ratifi cation, and over the years—particularly in the 1980s and 
1990s—many states voted to add it to the Constitution. With the ratifi cation of Michigan in 
1992 it passed the threshold of 3/4ths of the states required for adoption, but because the process 
took more than 200 years, its validity remains in doubt.

Chapter 5 The Making of a Revolution, 1754–1783 
Preludes to Revolution 
Material on the French and Indian War is from William M. Fowler, Jr., Empires At War: the 
French and Indian War and the Struggle for North America, 1754–1763 (New York: Walker & 
Company, 2005). See also Daniel K. Richter, Facing East from Indian Country: A Native History 
of Early America (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2001). Richter’s perceptive interpretation 
of the experience of American Indians is a key resource for understanding this material. 
“Th e Revolution Was in the Minds of the People” 
Gary Nash, Th e Unknown American Revolution: the Unruly Birth of Democracy and the 
Struggle to Create America (New York: Viking, 2005) is especially helpful for understanding 
the diverse voices of the revolutionary era. For a diff erent perspective see Gordon S. Wood, 
Th e Radicalism of the American Revolution (New York: Random House, 1991). See also 
Bernard Bailyn, Th e Intellectual Origins of the American Revolution (Cambridge: Harvard 
University Press, 1992). An excellent new source on urban street resistance to British authority 
can be found in Benjamin L. Carp, Rebels Rising: Cities and the American Revolution 
(New York: Oxford University Press, 2007). In order to explore these topics further see also 
Merrill Jensen, Tracts of the American Revolution (New York: Bobbs-Merrill, 1967), Jeremy 
Black, Revolutions in the Western World 1775–1825 (Hants, England: Ashgate, 2006), Edwin 
S. Gaustad, A Documentary History of Religion in America to the Civil War (Grand Rapids, 
MI: William B. Eerdmans, 1993), Carl Bridenbaugh, Mitre and Sceptre (1962), Mari Jo Buhle,

Principal Secretary of State for North America,” Th e Poems of Phillis Wheatley , and Lemuel 
Haynes, “Lexington, Massachusetts, 1775,” both in Herb Boyd, Autobiography of a People 
(New York: Doubleday, 2000). 
Th e War for Independence 
Robert Middlekauff , Th e Glorious Cause: Th e American Revolution, 1763–1789 (New York: 
Oxford University Press, 2005) is a thorough source on the Revolutionary War. See also David 
McCullough, John Adams (New York: Simon & Schuster, 2001), Joseph J. Ellis, American 
Sphinx: Th e Character of Th omas Jeff erson (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1997), Common Sense is 
worth reading carefully. I have been guided in analysis here by my own reading of the pamphlet 
and by Gregory Tietjen’s introduction to the 1995 edition, Th omas Paine, Common Sense (New 
York: Barnes & Noble, 1995); Richard Archer, As if An Enemy’s Country: Th e British Occupation 
of Boston and the Origins of Revolution (New York: Oxford University Press, 2010); John Shy , 
A People Numerous and Armed: Refl ections on the Military Struggle for American Independence 
(New York: Oxford University Press, 1976); Charles Royster, A Revolutionary People at War: 
Th e Continental Army and American Character (1979). Elizabeth F. Ellet, Th e Women of the 
American Revolution (New York: Charles Scribner, 1852) is a goldmine of material on the ways 
many diff erent women experienced the revolution. For women’s experience see also Marylynn 
Salmon, “Th e Limits of Independence: 1760–1800,” in Nancy F. Cott, editor, No Small Courage: 
A History of Women in the United States (New York: Oxford University Press, 2000). 
Chapter 6 Creating a Nation, 1783–1788 
Th e State of the Nation at War’s End 
David McCullough’s John Adams (New York: Simon & Schuster, 2001) was on the top of the 
bestseller charts, followed not far behind by Joseph J. Ellis’ Founding Brothers (New York: 
Alfred A. Knopf, 2000). Also very helpful in understanding the “founding fathers” is Ellis’ 
American Sphinx . Philip S. Foner, ed., Th e Complete Writings of Th omas Paine , (New York: 
Citidal Press, 1945), Vol. II, pp. 243, 286–287. Th e description of the Newburgh Conspiracy 
is taken from Richard H. Kohn, Eagle and Sword: the Federalists and the Creation of the 
Military Establishment in America, 1783–1802 (New York: Th e Free Press, 1975), pp. 17–39. 
Kohn’s work remains the best study of this and several other military developments in the 
earliest years of the Republic. For Shay’s Rebellion, see David P. Szatmary, Shay’s Rebellion: 
Th e Making of an Agrarian Insurrection (Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 
1980) and Leonard L. Richards, Shay’s Rebellion: the American Revolution’s Final Battle 
(Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2002). For an Indian perspective on the 
new U.S. government, see Daniel K. Richter, Facing East from Indian Country: A Native 
History of Early America (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2001), p. 164. Richter’s 
perceptive interpretation of the experience of American Indians is a key resource for understanding 
this material and also William L. Stone, Life of Joseph Brant—Th ayendanegea , 
(New York: Alexander V. Blake, 1838) two volumes, Vol. II, pp. 237–239. Ira Berlin, Th e 
Making of African America: Th e Four Great Migrations (New York: Viking, 2010) is a terrifi 
c source on the African American experience in the early Republic. See also Benjamin 
Banneker to Th omas Jeff erson, August 19, 1791 in Herb Boyd, editor, Autobiography of a 
People: Th ree Centuries of African American History Told by Th ose Who Lived It (New York: 
Random House, 2000), pp. 52–55; Phyllis Wheatley to Rev. Samson Occom, New London, 
Connecticut, February 11, 1774, in Julia Reidhead, editor, Th e Norton Anthology of American 
Literature , Fift h Edition (New York: W.W. Norton, 1998), Vol. I, pp. 838–839; and Memoirs 
of the Life of Boston King, a Black Preacher , 1798. I have used multiple sources in seeking 
to understand women’s experience during and aft er the Revolution including Mary Beth 
Norton, Liberty’s Daughters: Th e Revolutionary Experience of American Women, 1750–1800 
(Boston: Little, Brown, 1980), pp. 209–242; Mary Beth Norton, Founding Mothers & Fathers: 
Gendered Power and the Forming of American Society (New York: Random House, 1996), pp. 
404–405; Mari Jo Buhle, Teresa Murphy, and Jane Gerhard, Women in the Making of America 
(Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson, 2009), pp. 77–97; Marylynn Salmon, “Th e Limits of 
Independence, 1760–1800,” in Nancy F. Cott, editor, No Small Courage: A History of Women 
in the United States (New York: Oxford University Press, 2000), pp. 116–126; see quote on 
p. 120; and Dorothy A. Mays, Women in Early America: Struggle, Survival and Freedom in a 
New World (Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, 2004), p. 179. 
Creating a Government: Writing the U.S. Constitution 
I have used three main sources in telling the story of the writing and adoption of the 
Constitution: Richard Beeman, Plain, Honest Men: the Making of the American Constitution 
(New York: Random House, 2009), Woody Holton, Unruly Americans and the Origins of 
the Constitution (New York: Hill and Wang, 2007), and Max Ferrand, Th e Framing of the 
Constitution of the United States (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1913). Material on the state 
conventions can be found in Beeman pp. 386–411. See also Max Farrand, editor., Th e Records 
of the Federal Convention of 1787 , 4 vols. (New Haven, 1911–1937) ; Merrill Jensen, editor., Th e 
Documentary History of the Ratifi cation of the Constitution (Madison, WI: 1976), XIV. 
Chapter 7 Practicing Democracy, 1789–1800 
Convening a Congress, Inaugurating a President, Adopting a Bill of Rights 
Richard Labunski, James Madison and the Struggle for the Bill of Rights (New York: Oxford University 
Press, 2006), pp. 178–185, 187–204;, 278–280; Richard Beeman, Plain, Honest Men: the Making of 
the American Constitution (New York: Random House, 2009), pp. 413–414; John Ferling, Th e Ascent 
of George Washington: Th e Hidden Political Genius of an American Icon (New York: Bloomsbury 
Press, 2009), pp. 278–307. 
Creating an Economy: Alexander Hamilton and U.S. Economic System 
Ron Chernow, Alexander Hamilton (New York: Penguin Books, 2004) is a valuable source 
of information on Hamilton’s life and economic views. See especially pp. 286–295, 291–331, 
344–361, 370–381. 
Setting the Pace: Th e Washington Administration 
Ron Chernow, Washington: A Life (New York: the Penguin Press, 2010) is a useful new biography 
of George Washington. Also very useful is John Ferling, Th e Ascent of George Washington: 
Th e Hidden Political Genius of an American Icon (New York: Bloomsbury Press, 2009), especially 
pp. 287–289, 317–323, 330. Th ere are many sources on Washington’s second term diplomatic 
maneuvers. I have relied especially on George C. Herring, From Colony to Superpower: U.S. 
Foreign Relations Since 1776 (New York: Oxford University Press, 2008), pp. 56–92. 
Th e Birth of Political Parties: Adams and Jeff erson 
Th ere are many useful descriptions of the election of 1796 and Adams’s inauguration. See especially 
Gordon S. Wood, Empire of Liberty: A History of the Early Republic (New York: Oxford 
University Press, 2009), pp. 206–216; David McCullough, John Adams (New York: Simon & 
Schuster, 2001), pp. 458–471; Ferling, pp. 347–350. For the Quasi-War with France, see George 
C. Herring, From Colony to Superpower: U.S. Foreign Relations Since 1776 (New York: Oxford 
University Press, 2008), pp. 83–92; Wood, Empire of Liberty , pp. 209–275; McCullough, pp. 
467–536. Th e best source on the election of 1800 is Edward J. Larson, A Magnifi cent Catastrophe: 
the Tumultuous Election of 1800, America’s First Presidential Campaign (New York: Th e Free Press, 
2007). As the subtitle indicates, this book is a study of just the topic of this section of the chapter. 
See also Wood, pp. 276–314; McCullough, pp. 535–559. 
Chapter 8 Creating a New People, Expanding the Country, 1801–1823 
Jeff erson and the Republican Ideal 
Gordon S. Wood, Empire of Liberty: A History of the Early Republic, 1789–1815 (New York: 
Oxford University Press, 2009) is a fi rst rate overview of the culture and political life of the U.S. 
in the Jeff ersonian era and beyond. It has served as my prime source for much of this material. 
See especially, pp. 276–356 and 576–619. For Jeff erson’s relationship with Sally Hemings, see 
Annette Gordon-Reed, Th e Hemingses of Monticello: An American Family (New York: W. W. 
Norton, 2008). 
Th e Ideal of Religious Freedom 
For religious developments in the era an excellent place to start is Sydney E. Ahlstrom, A 
Religious History of the American People , Second Edition (New Haven: Yale University Press, 
2004), pp. 429–454. See also Alice Felt Tyler, Freedom’s Ferment: Phases of American Social 
History from the Colonial Period to the Outbreak of the Civil War (New York: Harper & Row, 
1944); Th omas L. Webber, Deep Like the Rivers: Education in the Slave Quarter Community, 
1831–1865 (New York: W. W. Norton, 1978), pp. 80–81, 191–206; Ira Berlin, Th e Making of

and Jane Gerhard, Women and the Making of America (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Prentice 
Hall, 2009), pp. 115–117. For the Lewis and Clark expedition’s story, I have relied primarily on 
Frederick E. Hoxie and Jay T. Nelson, editors, Lewis & Clark and the Indian Country: Th e Native 
American Perspective (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 2007) and the classic Journals of Lewis 
and Clark , edited by Bernard DeVoto (Boston: Houghton Miffl in, 1953). For two very diff erent 
views of the expedition see also Alvin M. Josephy, Jr., Lewis and Clark Th rough Indian Eyes (New 
York: Vintage, 2006) and Stephen E. Ambrose, Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Th omas 
Jeff erson, and the Opening of the American West (New York: Simon & Schuster, 1996). 
Th e War of 1812: “Mr. Madison’s War” 
Th e story of the War of 1812 is told in many places. I have drawn primarily on Herring, From 
Colony to Superpower, pp. 93–133; Wood, Empire of Liberty , pp. 659–700; Th omas Bender, A 
Nation Among the Nations: America’s Place in World History (New York: Hill & Wang, 2006), 
pp. 106–115. Th e material on Tecumseh and the Prophet is from John Sugden, Tecumseh: A Life 
(New York: Henry Holt, 1997), by far the best of many biographies of the Indian leader. 
Expanding American Territory and Infl uence 
Herring, From Colony to Superpower , pp. 134–175; Wood, Empire of Liberty , p. 370; Daniel 
K. Richter, Facing East from Indian Country: A Native History of Early America (Cambridge: 
Harvard University Press, 2001), pp. 226–236; Sellers, pp. 181–185. 
Chapter 9 New Industries, New Politics, 1815–1828 
Creating the Cotton Economy 
Daniel Walker Howe, What Hath God Wrought: Th e Transformation of America, 1815–1848 
(New York: Oxford University Press, 2007) and Gene Dattel, Cotton and Race in the Making 
of America: the Human Costs of Economic Power (Chicago: Ivan R. Dee, 2009) are essential 
reading for understanding the impact of cotton on the United States in the early 1800s. See 
also Henry Bibb, Narrative of the Life and Adventures of Henry Bibb (New York: Published by 
the Author, 1849), pp. 114–118, cited in Sean Patrick Adams, T he Early American Republic:

packet ships see Stephen Fox, Transatlantic: Samuel Cunard, Isambard Brunel, and the Great 
Atlantic Steamships (New York: Harper Collins, 2003), pp. 3–7. 
Commerce, Technology, and Transportation 
In addition to Howe, What Hath God Wrought , Charles Sellers, Th e Market Revolution: Jacksonian 
America, 1815–1846 (New York: Oxford University Press, 1991) is essential reading for this material. 
See also Carol Sheriff , Th e Artifi cial River: Th e Erie Canal and the Paradox of Progress, 1817–1862 
(New York: Hill and Wang, 1996); Washington Irving, Th e Sketch Book (New York, 1819). Gordon 
Wood’s Introduction to Empire of Liberty tells the Rip Van Winkle story and its implications for a 
changing America very well. For the story of Ichabod Washburn see Joyce Appleby, Inheriting the 
Revolution: Th e First Generation of Americans (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2000), p. 9. 
See also Sellers, pp. 152–157. 
From the Era of Good Feeling to the Politics of Division 
Howe, What Hath God Wrought and Sellers, Th e Market Revolution are also essential reading 
for understanding the politics of the 1820s. For further detail see Joseph J. Ellis, American 
Sphinx: Th e Character of Th omas Jeff erson (New York: Random House, 1996), pp. 316–317; Jon 
Meacham, American Lion: Andrew Jackson in the White House (New York: Random House, 
2008), pp. 41–49. 
Chapter 10 Democracy in the Age of Jackson, 1828–1844 
Jacksonian Democracy, Jacksonian Government 
Jon Meacham, American Lion: Andrew Jackson in the White House (New York: Random House, 
2008) is an excellent political biography of Jackson. To understand the opposition to Jackson 
it is useful to read David S. Heidler and Jeanne T. Heidler, Henry Clay: Th e Essential American 
(New York: Random House, 2010). For an overview of the Jacksonian era an excellent source is 
Daniel Walker Howe, What Hath God Wrought: Th e Transformation of America, 1815–1848 (New 
York: Oxford University Press, 2007); William G. McLaughlin’s Cherokee Renascence in the New 
Republic (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1986).remains the best story of the Cherokee 
experience in the half century leading up to Removal. Also important is Th eda Perdue, Cherokee 
Women (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1998); Howe, What Hath God Wrought , pp. 342– 
357 and 414–423 and Meacham, American Lion: Andrew Jackson in the White House , pp. 141–
